# Netanyahu fires back at Biden, Newsom
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=0.0s)]
*  In a Fox News alert, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority resigning, yep, setting [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=1.0s)]
*  up for a new government in the West Bank as war against America's greatest ally in the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=7.26s)]
*  Mideast, Israel, still rages. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=11.44s)]
*  Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joins us live from Jerusalem with an update. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=13.66s)]
*  I guess the breaking news is this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=18.04s)]
*  The cabinet, Mr. Prime Minister, thanks for joining us, has agreed to offer their resignation, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=19.68s)]
*  but Mahmoud Abbas hasn't agreed to accept it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=24.62s)]
*  If they do resign, does that pave the way for an acceptable two-state solution? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=27.52s)]
*  No, well, first of all, I think that's musical chairs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=32.16s)]
*  They haven't had an election in the Palestinian Authority for 17 years, so they're just shuffling [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  chairs. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  But the real thing we want to see is genuine de-radicalization. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=42.8s)]
*  They have to stop teaching their children to become terrorists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=47.08s)]
*  They have to stop paying terrorists based on the amount of Jews they kill. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=50.0s)]
*  teaching and indoctrinating a whole generation on the annihilation of Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=54.72s)]
*  That's real reform. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=59.76s)]
*  That so far has not happened. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=61.16s)]
*  I hope it does happen, but it so far hasn't happened. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=62.72s)]
*  As far as the Palestinian state is concerned. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=65.08s)]
*  Yes, go ahead. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=67.36s)]
*  Do the Palestinians want a two-state solution, Mr. Prime Minister? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=68.36s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, I think that what they want is a one-state solution. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=72.32s)]
*  They don't want a state next to Israel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  They want a state instead of Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=78.92s)]
*  And that's why I brought a resolution to the Knesset, our parliament, last week. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=81.34s)]
*  And 99 out of 120, it's actually 99 to 9, because the rest abstained, voted against [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=86.06s)]
*  the attempt to impose on Israel a Palestinian state. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=92.06s)]
*  Now, why did they do that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  Because we've just had a Palestinian state, a de facto state. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  Hamas in Gaza had a de facto Palestinian state. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=99.62s)]
*  And what did they do with it, Brian? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=103.06s)]
*  They use it to rape women, behead them, burn babies alive, murder children in front of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=104.78s)]
*  their parents and parents in front of their children, took hostages. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=110.18s)]
*  That's the equivalent of 29-11s in one day, like 50,000 Americans butchered and 10,000 [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=113.5s)]
*  held hostage, including mothers and children, babies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=120.98s)]
*  That's what this state produced. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=124.78s)]
*  So naturally, you understand there's overwhelming support for my position. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  It's not an outlier position. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=130.10000000000002s)]
*  It's not a fringe position. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=131.68s)]
*  The people of Israel are united as never before in saying that what we will not accept is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  a Palestinian state that will endanger Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=138.78s)]
*  That's rewarding terrorism. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=141.3s)]
*  This will set a Guinness World Book of Records on rewarding terrorists after they committed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  the most atrocious savagery against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=147.94s)]
*  So I want you to hear what Governor Newsom said about your reluctance with the Stutt [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=152.36s)]
*  State solution on everything you just outlined. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=155.9s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=159.22s)]
*  With regard to Benjamin Netanyahu, who I've visited and I've worked with in the past, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=161.34s)]
*  he's doubling down on stupid as it relates to the two-state solution and walking away [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=167.1s)]
*  from that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=170.66s)]
*  Let's work to get these hostages home, to work to eliminate Hamas and rebuild Gaza and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=171.66s)]
*  advance a two-state solution. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=175.94s)]
*  Are you doubling down on stupid? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, I met the governor when he was here, and I hope he had a chance to tour the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=179.7s)]
*  country because then he would have seen that this is not my personal position. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=185.9s)]
*  It's the position of the people of Israel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=190.18s)]
*  They're not stupid. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  They understand that to just offer a Palestinian state is to give a platform for the repeated [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=193.06s)]
*  attempts to annihilate the Jewish state. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=199.54s)]
*  And Hamas has already promised that if it has, if it's reconstituted, if Israel doesn't [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=202.26s)]
*  win the war, then they'll do this October 7 massacre over and over and over again, their [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=207.62s)]
*  words. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=212.74s)]
*  So I don't think the people of Israel are stupid. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=213.74s)]
*  I think they're actually very smart. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  That's why they support my position in achieving total victory, defeating Hamas, bringing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=216.84s)]
*  back the hostages and making sure that Gaza doesn't pose a threat to Israel again. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=223.52s)]
*  And that means that Israel will have to have the overriding security control over that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=228.2s)]
*  territory for the foreseeable future. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=233.08s)]
*  That doesn't come with unlimited Palestinian sovereignty. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  I think the people are smart. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=238.96s)]
*  Does the president Biden that hugged you after October 7th resemble the same one that seems [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=241.28s)]
*  upset with you now saying your reaction in Gaza has been over the top? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=247.02s)]
*  What's your reaction to the seemingly withering support from this administration? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=252.2s)]
*  Look, I appreciate the president's support at the beginning of the war and throughout [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=256.92s)]
*  we've had our differences of opinion, but we've been able to agree on the three war [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=262.64s)]
*  aims, destroying Hamas, bringing back the hostages and making sure that Gaza is not [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=268.56s)]
*  a threat to Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=273.72s)]
*  But I think that there are natural differences of opinion. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=274.72s)]
*  I can tell you one thing though. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=277.44s)]
*  I just came out of a meeting with Colonel John Spencer. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=279.04s)]
*  John Spencer is the world expert on urban warfare. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  He heads the urban warfare department in West Point and he's compared what Israel is doing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=286.0s)]
*  in trying to fight these terrorists who are not only systematically target civilians, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=292.52s)]
*  but hide behind their civilians. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=297.52s)]
*  He said that there is no other army that is in the world that has gone to the lengths [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=299.08s)]
*  that Israel has gone to to prevent civilian casualties. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=303.96s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=308.28s)]
*  So I don't think our reaction is over the top. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=309.76s)]
*  I think the Israeli army is setting the gold standard of how to fight terrorists embedded [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=311.68s)]
*  in civilian neighborhoods, in hospitals, in schools, and yet minimize the ratio of civilian [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=316.12s)]
*  casualties. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=322.38s)]
*  I'll tell you, every civilian casualty is a tragedy and they should all be brought to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=323.38s)]
*  the doorstep of Hamas that is using them as human shields. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=328.26s)]
*  I want you to hear what Jake Sullivan just warned you guys about. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=331.86s)]
*  He knows you're going to go into Ra'afah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=334.94s)]
*  He warned you, you better not go in without a plan to get the civilians out. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=336.82s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=341.18s)]
*  Talking about more than a million people who have been pushed into this small space in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  Gaza because of military operations elsewhere. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=346.02s)]
*  It's also the area where all of the humanitarian assistance comes into Gaza to serve all of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=349.46s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=353.9s)]
*  And so we've been clear that we do not believe that an operation, a major military operation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=354.9s)]
*  should proceed in Ra'afah unless there is a clear and executable plan to protect those [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=360.02s)]
*  civilians, to get them to safety and to feed, clothe, and house them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=364.68s)]
*  And we have not seen a plan like that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=369.3s)]
*  Have you heard this plan since he said that yesterday? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=371.9s)]
*  Have the Americans been briefed on your plan? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=375.66s)]
*  Well, actually, last night I had a meeting with the general staff and the security cabinet [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=378.1s)]
*  and the army showed us the plan, a double plan, one for the evacuation and humanitarian [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=384.14000000000004s)]
*  assistance of the civilian population in Ra'afah and second, the elimination of the remaining [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=389.66s)]
*  quarter roughly of the Hamas terrorist battalions that are in Ra'afah. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  We can't leave them there because that's like leaving a quarter of ISIS in place in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=401.18s)]
*  a defined territory. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  You wouldn't do that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, you didn't do it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  So we're not going to do that either. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=409.06s)]
*  But we do have a combined plan of evacuating civilians out of harm's way and destroying [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=411.3s)]
*  those battalions. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=417.26s)]
*  I can tell you that Hamas will be doing everything in their power to make sure that we don't [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=418.26s)]
*  evacuate the civilians because they actually try to stop them at gunpoint and often at [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=421.86s)]
*  gunfire. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=426.42s)]
*  But that's not going to stop us. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=427.42s)]
*  We won't give them immunity. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  We'll get the population out. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  We'll continue the job to achieve total victory. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=431.06s)]
*  Total victory is how you win the war and total victory is how you win the peace. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=434.38s)]
*  You can't win the peace if you don't win the war. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=438.7s)]
*  I know you've taken out 18 of 24 Hamas battalions, but they said you've only taken out 30 percent [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=440.94s)]
*  of Hamas higher-ups. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  Many are hiding in the tunnels below. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  If America tells you don't go into Ra'afah, will you go in anyway? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=450.26s)]
*  Well, we'll go in. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  We make our own decisions, obviously, but we'll go in based on the idea of having also [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=456.86s)]
*  the evacuation of the civilians. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=461.86s)]
*  By the way, I agree with the U.S. on this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't have a different position because our strategy right now has always been, from [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=466.09999999999997s)]
*  the beginning, to try to get civilians out of harm's way, and we've been largely successful. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  The ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza is now down below one-to-one, which [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=476.26s)]
*  is just unheard of in this kind of crowded urban warfare. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=482.88s)]
*  But again, we'll do our best to get as many of them out. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=486.22s)]
*  They'll have the opportunity to leave. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=489.26000000000005s)]
*  That's not an American position. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=491.38000000000005s)]
*  That's my position. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=494.02000000000004s)]
*  I understand, too, that one of the big stories that everyone cares most about, especially [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=495.02000000000004s)]
*  the Americans, no offense, are the hostages. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=498.70000000000005s)]
*  You have over 130 behind enemy lines. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=501.82000000000005s)]
*  What could you tell us about those talks in Qatar? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  The word is, according to U.S. officials, the basic contours of a deal are agreed upon. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=508.88000000000005s)]
*  Would you describe it the same way? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=515.86s)]
*  Well, I hope so. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=517.46s)]
*  I think we're there. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=520.38s)]
*  I'm not sure Hamas is there. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=521.38s)]
*  They have what I'd call outlandish demands. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=522.82s)]
*  That's like in another orbit, another planet. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=525.74s)]
*  They have to come down to reality, and I think that if that's the case, we'll be able to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=528.38s)]
*  have a deal. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=533.7s)]
*  We certainly want it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=534.7s)]
*  I want it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=535.7s)]
*  Look, we've already been able to free half the hostages, which is a singular achievement, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=536.7s)]
*  but we want the remainder, too. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  I've devoted my life, ever since I was a young commander in a special unit, I myself was [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=544.78s)]
*  wounded in an attempt to release hostages from a hijacked Sabine aircraft. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=551.22s)]
*  My older brother was killed while leading the storming party at the raid of Antebe, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=556.42s)]
*  which released 103 Jewish hostages. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=562.1s)]
*  We're totally committed. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=566.06s)]
*  We just had a heroic operation in which we released two hostages. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=567.06s)]
*  We just took them out of the jaws of the terrorists. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  So obviously, we want this deal if we can have it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=574.26s)]
*  It depends on Hamas. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=578.02s)]
*  It's really now their decision, because I think the ground has been laid, but they have [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=579.1s)]
*  to enter the ballpark. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=584.74s)]
*  They're not in town yet. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=587.54s)]
*  Only 30 seconds left. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=588.54s)]
*  I understand efforts have been stepped up against Hezbollah in the north. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=589.54s)]
*  Do you believe war with Hezbollah is inevitable or closer now than it was before Hamas's attack [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=594.18s)]
*  on October 7th? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=599.88s)]
*  Hezbollah attacked us on October 8th, the day after the Hamas massacre, and we've been [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=602.6999999999999s)]
*  exchanging blows ever since. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=608.18s)]
*  Our goal is to bring back 100,000 people who left the border with Lebanon, with Hezbollah, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=610.14s)]
*  Israelis who want to go back to their homes. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=616.98s)]
*  If this can be achieved diplomatically, fine. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=619.14s)]
*  If not, it'll be achieved militarily. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=621.9s)]
*  My preference is to achieve it diplomatically, but I can't tell you that Hezbollah will cooperate. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=623.78s)]
*  In any case, we'll get these people back to their homes. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=629.8199999999999s)]
*  And we hope to have you back here and talking about when all the hostages are back. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=632.02s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvgd4FM8yA0&t=635.26s)]
