# ‘LIAR’: AOC called out by protester during town hall
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio)
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, we cover her very closely on Fox News TCS and every [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=0.0s)]
*  now and then things get so bad in her district that it breaks through to our [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  main channel and here we are so she had a town hall and people are very mad in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=9.48s)]
*  her district and she saw this early on in the Ukraine War a lot of people [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=16.6s)]
*  upset that she was supporting the Ukraine War because her district has a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=20.56s)]
*  lot of liberal people who are anti-war so now the situation in Gaza has many of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=24.12s)]
*  her constituents upset and here she is at a town hall and she seems unable to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  control the situation watch. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=35.4s)]
*  We have some ground rules here which is that we wait for the Q&A because we don't want to deprive all of our neighbors of the ability to have information and hear things that respond to it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=54.12s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer that question. We're more than happy to do that but we need to be able to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=61.12s)]
*  have those conversations. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=77.12s)]
*  This is a political problem for Democrats and especially for somebody like AOC and it's not going away anytime soon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=84.12s)]
*  Yeah a couple things. First of all look if you don't want to support the Ukraine War that doesn't make you a liberal or conservative it just means that maybe you want to spend the money that we hold. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=87.12s)]
*  Maybe we could do something with that here. Second of all if you want to interrupt someone in Congress who's having a town hall in this circumstance good for you because if you don't hold them to account trust me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=96.12s)]
*  We live in Washington. They just get praise and they're gas-lit and everything. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=103.12s)]
*  You should give them the business if you don't think they're doing the bidding of you and your neighbors. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=106.12s)]
*  So I interviewed a guy last week who is from her district and it was fascinating. He basically said I have a pizza place. It's across the street from her office. I had a gas leak. I needed some help with stuff. I went to her office. Nobody helped me. I wrote letters. I made calls. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=133.12s)]
*  He's like she's not there and we've done interview after interview for Fox Nutisias where we go in and we ask her constituents they either don't know who she is or they're disappointed with her. They knew her from the campaign in her first few runs and then they said she's never here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=151.12s)]
*  And then she shows back up for a town hall like this and she gets an earful because people are really angry at her and what she tries to do is deflect and now you see her going off on Doge watch. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=166.12s)]
*  A lot of times Republicans can go around and they're like oh they're just cutting waste. This is just about fraud and abuse. No. 12 people died in this neighborhood and we were doing something to fix it and they have cut it. This is not about going after waste, fraud and abuse. This is about looting the public funds in order to pay for tax cuts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=179.12s)]
*  Deflect deflect. Yeah. And you know it's a new era of these politicians who managed to get on Twitter and they make a big name for themselves. They raise a lot of money. But then they end up not caring about like basic constituent services and how and the things that actually matter to people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=207.12s)]
*  And so you wind up with this mess and I can think of no one better to have to suffer the consequences than these people. Yeah. No. She's campaigning in Idaho with Bernie Sanders instead of taking care of her district. And the people are angry. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hp_tWHjDio&t=222.12s)]
