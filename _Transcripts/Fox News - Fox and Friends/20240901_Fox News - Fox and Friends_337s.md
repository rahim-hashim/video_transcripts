# Gold Star families defend Trump after Harris' criticism
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0)
*  Here's another case where the media is also weighing in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'll let you set this up, Joey, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=4.32s)]
*  because I know this one's close to your heart. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so for those of you that don't know, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=7.0s)]
*  Section 60 in Arlington is essentially [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=8.8s)]
*  where all of the killed in action [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=12.34s)]
*  are buried from mine and Pete's war, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=13.88s)]
*  the 20-year war, Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=15.76s)]
*  And it's very well known to us, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=18.32s)]
*  and it's something that's very near and dear to us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=20.16s)]
*  I've seen Westboro Baptist Church protest there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=21.48s)]
*  I've seen a half dozen of my friends buried there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=24.62s)]
*  And essentially what has happened is President Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=27.68s)]
*  was invited by the families of the 13 Afghanistan heroes [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=30.12s)]
*  that were killed at the Abbey Gate [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=34.18s)]
*  to come and present a wreath, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=36.28s)]
*  and then afterwards he was invited to visit graves. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=38.4s)]
*  The original or the first, the initial reaction was, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=40.88s)]
*  this was so solemn and quiet and respectful. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=44.44s)]
*  But now with a little bit of detail, Kamala Harris [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=48.08s)]
*  and the entire Democrat establishment [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=50.64s)]
*  is attacking President Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=52.6s)]
*  for simply visiting the graves of those heroes [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=54.44s)]
*  and at the request of family members taking pictures. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=58.64s)]
*  This is Kamala Harris's post on X. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=61.36s)]
*  She says, let me be clear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=63.2s)]
*  The former president disrespected sacred ground, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=65.08s)]
*  all for the sake of a political stunt. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=68.72s)]
*  This is nothing new from Donald Trump. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=71.0s)]
*  This is a man who has called our fallen service members [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=72.6s)]
*  suckers and losers and despairs Medal of Honor recipients. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=75.8s)]
*  This is a man who was unable to comprehend anything [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=78.6s)]
*  other than service to himself. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=81.8s)]
*  First of all, there's a lies in that statement. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=83.2s)]
*  But put those on the side for a minute [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=86.96s)]
*  and just look at what she said [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=88.8s)]
*  about how he disgraced or dishonored a solemn place. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=90.08s)]
*  Ma'am, he showed up to Arlington National Cemetery. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  Where were you? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  These service members died, apparently, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  while you were the last person in the room [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=102.96s)]
*  making decisions that led to their death. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  I've never heard you utter their names. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=107.88s)]
*  I've never seen you meet with their parents, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=109.88s)]
*  many of whom invited Donald Trump to be there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=112.08s)]
*  I've spoken to their parents. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=115.28s)]
*  I've met them and shaken their hands and hugged their necks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=118.04s)]
*  Where the hell were you on that day? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=121.16s)]
*  And all you want to do is make a political point out of it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=124.16s)]
*  You're the one making this for show, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=126.72s)]
*  and that is absolutely dishonorable. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=128.4s)]
*  Well, you spoke about the parents, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=130.12s)]
*  and here's what they had to say. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=132.04s)]
*  We invited President Trump. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=135.24s)]
*  We are the ones that asked for the video [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=138.16s)]
*  and the pictures to be taken. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=141.52s)]
*  President Trump has been there for us from the very beginning, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=144.2s)]
*  when our son and the other 12 of his brothers and sisters in arms [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=147.56s)]
*  were murdered due to your negligence [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=153.2s)]
*  and uncaring attitude towards our military. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Why did we want Trump there? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=158.6s)]
*  It wasn't to help his political campaign. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  We wanted a leader. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=164.6s)]
*  That explains why you and Joe didn't get a call. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=167.88s)]
*  Vice President Harris, I ask you, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=170.12s)]
*  why won't you return a call and explain to us [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=173.48s)]
*  how you call my daughter-in-law's death a success? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=177.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=182.28s)]
*  why will you not express your condolences yourself? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Why have we never heard from you? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  And finally, why would you take a day [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=192.48s)]
*  where we celebrated the death of our loved one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=194.88s)]
*  and use it to disparage not only them but us? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=198.84s)]
*  Because this is heartbreaking, but I want to ask you, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=203.48s)]
*  Pete, just from a political perspective, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=205.88s)]
*  why the heck would Kamala Harris weigh in on this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  when she has blood on her hands here? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=212.68s)]
*  This is, I just, from a political point of view, this is dumb. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=214.6s)]
*  Well, their entire, I mean, their entire premise of, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden's campaign and hers is predicated on hoaxes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=221.0s)]
*  about Donald Trump, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=223.4s)]
*  Fine people hoax, suckers and losers hoax, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=224.8s)]
*  all these, so this is another hoax, Arlington hoax, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=227.48s)]
*  trying to make him, because listen, when you watched, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=231.04s)]
*  when I saw Donald Trump there, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=233.56s)]
*  the first thing I thought watching it live was, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=235.16s)]
*  where the hell is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=237.16s)]
*  I checked with Ryan Mass and said, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=239.4s)]
*  what in the world is going on? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=240.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=243.48s)]
*  It was like, it was really amazing to me [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=244.32s)]
*  that a former president, not a sitting representative [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  of the current government was there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  It was almost, it was jaw dropping. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=253.44s)]
*  Exactly, so why weigh in on it, Joey? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=255.32s)]
*  That's my question, like what? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=257.24s)]
*  Like this just brings up Afghanistan for them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=258.56s)]
*  They think they can make it all about him again, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=262.4s)]
*  that's their political kind. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=265.88s)]
*  It's not gonna work this time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=267.04s)]
*  I don't think so either. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=268.04s)]
*  They're flailing on this, but they've counted on hoaxes [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=269.64s)]
*  that then get perpetuated by the media [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=272.0s)]
*  to create a caricature of Donald Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=274.04s)]
*  When these families know the real deal, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=276.04s)]
*  and what everything Joey said is true, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=277.76s)]
*  he was invited, he went, and then based on anonymous sources, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=279.68s)]
*  they're trying to smear him as someone who disrespects, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=283.52s)]
*  by the way, Joe Biden has a campaign ad [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=286.16s)]
*  that puts him in section 60 from 2020. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=288.56s)]
*  Like they've, if this is so terrible, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  they've done the same thing, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=294.44s)]
*  but they just did it for their own political benefit. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=296.56s)]
*  He did it, you know who wanted the cameras there? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=298.2s)]
*  You know who wanted the cameras there? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=300.04s)]
*  The families, because the families want people [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=301.04s)]
*  to not forget what happened to those 13. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=303.64s)]
*  And they're deeply hurt that the Kamala Harris [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=305.64s)]
*  Biden administration has forgotten them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=309.24s)]
*  I think it's so important to note, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=312.4s)]
*  they've never said their names. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=314.32s)]
*  They've never called them, they won't return calls. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  No. Just real quick, just to put in perspective, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=319.52s)]
*  13 died, and within hours last night of Kamala Harris's tweet, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=321.55999999999995s)]
*  six parents of five of the heroes posted videos within hours. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=326.32s)]
*  That shows you where the support is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  among those Gold Star families. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely, and he showed up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLfB6Db7X0&t=334.96s)]
