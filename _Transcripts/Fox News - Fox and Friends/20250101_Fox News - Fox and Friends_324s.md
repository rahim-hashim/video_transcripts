# Tom Homan issues warning to migrant criminals: 'Trump is going to take action'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE)
*  Chaos at the southern border. Three migrants have been arrested for allegedly killing a Mexican immigration agent after he asked for their IDs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=0.0s)]
*  While Texas DPS arrest 11 illegal migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico as more rushed to cross before Trump takes office, the incoming border czar Tom Homan joins us now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=8.0s)]
*  Tom, you're the hardest man already in the incoming Trump administration. You're up early. Happy New Year. Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=20.0s)]
*  Let's get right to the news, Tom. You and I have talked extensively about what's happening on the Mexican side of the border, but this assault on the I and M agent there just about 30 miles south of Ciudad Juarez is something that we typically don't see your reaction to that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, I think we may see more of it. I mean, the President Trump, you know, I'm not speaking for President Trump, but you know, he's going to take action against the criminal cartels in Mexico. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=47.0s)]
*  Criminal cartels in Mexico killed more American people than every terrorist organization in the world. So, you know, shutting down the border is going to put them out of business. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=61.0s)]
*  So I think you don't see more violence on the border in the beginning, but it's something we certainly have to do. We got to secure the border because it's the biggest national security vulnerability we've ever seen in this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=70.0s)]
*  So I think we'll see more cross border crime in the beginning. But, you know, it's something we expect that someone going to have to deal with because we have to secure that border. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=80.0s)]
*  And, you know, the past four years have given us these unprecedented chaos numbers. There's nearly 11 million migrant encounters now at the Biden Harris. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=88.0s)]
*  It's been under the Biden Harris administration that doesn't even include the two million known gotaways, which could be even higher. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=99.0s)]
*  Tom, Mayor, the New York City mayor here, Eric Adams, that has met with you, that has pledged to work with you again last night talking about looking for ways to help get this under control. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=106.0s)]
*  Here's a little bit of what he said yesterday. Listen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=118.0s)]
*  Those who violate their privilege to be in this country by committing serious violent acts should not be in our country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=121.0s)]
*  And I've made it clear that I'm going to do everything possible to protect New Yorkers. I did it as a cop. I'm going to do it as the mayor of the city of New York. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=129.0s)]
*  We're looking at every option we have either through executive orders or we can get help from Albany. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=137.0s)]
*  I think they're moving in the wrong direction. If you're in this country, you should be in this country not to harm New Yorkers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=143.0s)]
*  Tom, have you had any more conversations recently with Mayor Adams and what are some of those options to try and deal with these sanctuary jurisdictions that might try and stand in your way? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=150.0s)]
*  Well, Mayor Adams is trying to do the right thing. The problem is he has a city council that doesn't want him to work with ICE, but he has committed on a couple of things. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=162.0s)]
*  Number one, he's committed to working with public safety threats with ICE, having his officers with us shoulder to shoulder to arrest public safety threats in that city, because that's where we're going to prioritize. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=171.0s)]
*  Day one, right off the gate are going to be public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=181.0s)]
*  He agrees with me. They have plenty in New York City. He wants to make New York City safer. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=186.0s)]
*  He's also committed to help us find over 300,000 missing children, children that many are going to be in New York City. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=190.0s)]
*  These are children that were trafficking to the United States, released by the Biden administration to unbent sponsors, and now they can't find them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=196.0s)]
*  Many of these children are going to be in forced labor, forced sex trafficking. Some of them will be just fine, but we've got to find these children, save them, and get them back with their families. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=204.0s)]
*  And third, he's considering an executive order to get us back into Rikers Island. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=212.0s)]
*  I mean, when I was ICE director, we had a dozen agents assigned to Rikers Island. We would take hundreds of criminal aliens out of Rikers Island every month. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=217.0s)]
*  And now we have no presence in Rikers Island because of the sanctuary city law. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=225.0s)]
*  But he's talking about doing an executive action to get us back into Rikers Island, which is arresting a criminal alien and safety and security of a county jail. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=229.0s)]
*  It's much safer than going into the community and finding a bad guy on his turf who has access to who knows what weapons, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=237.0s)]
*  So being inside the jail is safe for the alien, it's safer for the officer, and it's much safer for the community. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=244.0s)]
*  So those are the things we're talking about getting done. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=249.0s)]
*  And in particularly the migrant communities, like in the case of the Venezuelan migrant community, being plagued by the Tren de Aragua gang members that continue to grow across the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=251.0s)]
*  You mentioned ICE, Tom, the current acting ICE director, PJ Lechleitner, taking action, we learned yesterday, ending a couple of programs that basically were providing social services to migrants, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=260.0s)]
*  the wraparound stabilization service and the young adult case management. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=274.0s)]
*  Basically, in a nutshell, this was millions, if not tens of millions of dollars that the current administration decided to implement and ICE decided it wasn't effective. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=278.0s)]
*  I'll give you the last 10 seconds, your reaction to that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=287.0s)]
*  This administration is spending millions of dollars not to detain people, and this program didn't detain people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=292.0s)]
*  Detaining people is cheaper for American people. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=297.0s)]
*  So immigration ICE beds are much cheaper than any of these programs they came up with. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=300.0s)]
*  So in the Trump administration, we'll be using those ICE beds. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=304.0s)]
*  We look forward to following it and covering it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=307.0s)]
*  Tom Homan, Happy New Year. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=309.0s)]
*  Thank you for getting up early. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=310.0s)]
*  Happy New Year. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlSqN2MxFE&t=313.0s)]
