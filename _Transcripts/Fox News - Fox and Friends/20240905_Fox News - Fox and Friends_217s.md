# Marine veteran taking on Elizabeth Warren: 'She's losing votes every day'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4)
*  So Republican and Marine Corps veteran John Deaton secured a victory in this week's Massachusetts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=0.0s)]
*  Senate primary with more than 60 percent of the vote. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=8.0s)]
*  He's now set to take on longtime Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and says it's time [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=11.64s)]
*  to hold her accountable. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=17.28s)]
*  John Deaton joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=18.44s)]
*  So John, I asked you, you know, looking at polling data and how things run in Massachusetts, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=19.78s)]
*  you know, why are you different? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=25.44s)]
*  You told me what? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=27.02s)]
*  Well, first I'm different because of my life experience. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=28.06s)]
*  I come from extreme, severe poverty, growing up one of the most dangerous neighborhoods [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=30.46s)]
*  in America inside of a subsection of Detroit. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  I've served in the Marine Corps. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=38.82s)]
*  I'm the living dream. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=40.9s)]
*  When you look at me, Lawrence, I am the living, breathing embodiment of the American dream [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=41.9s)]
*  and everything that's possible in a great, free country like ours. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=45.82s)]
*  And I got in this race because I see that dream dying because you have these elites [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=49.4s)]
*  like Elizabeth Warren. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  They sit back, hyper-partisan people, and they fuel division so that they can stay [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=54.02s)]
*  in power. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=58.42s)]
*  And people are tired of it, and I think they're ready for change, and I'm going to bring [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=59.42s)]
*  that change to Massachusetts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  So they typically vote solid blue. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=63.42s)]
*  You say that you're not a partisan, though. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=67.98s)]
*  Well, my loyalty is going to be to Massachusetts and America. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=69.14s)]
*  I served in the Marine Corps. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=72.34s)]
*  I took an oath. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=73.34s)]
*  I know what that oath means, to serve your country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=74.34s)]
*  And so Elizabeth Warren is loyal to the Democratic Party. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=76.86s)]
*  She's loyal to her agenda and her own political motivations and ambitions. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=80.38s)]
*  I will have one test in the United States Senate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=85.3s)]
*  Is it good for Massachusetts and America? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  If it is, I'm all in. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=90.5s)]
*  And if it's not, it's not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=91.5s)]
*  And that test and that loyalty is what's going to separate us. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=93.34s)]
*  So a lot of the things that Elizabeth Warren stands for, she got a lot of support within [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=96.06s)]
*  your state. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=100.34s)]
*  And it's a lot of the things that the country at large has rejected when it comes to the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  border, Medicare for All, all of these programs. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=105.17999999999999s)]
*  Are you going to run against those ideas? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=108.22000000000001s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=110.26s)]
*  I'm running on the American dream and what I've done in my life. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  Listen, 64 percent—this is what people don't know about Massachusetts—64 percent [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=115.22000000000001s)]
*  are actually independents. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  They're called unenrolled voters, not Republican or Democrat. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=120.54s)]
*  And there's a big difference now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  Massachusetts has become a border state. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=126.22s)]
*  We have a right to shelter law. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  So we have to house the migrants. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=130.4s)]
*  It doesn't require residency that was passed in the early 80s and feed them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=132.18s)]
*  It's bankrupting the state. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=136.10000000000002s)]
*  It's over a billion dollars has been—taxpayer money has went to house the migrants. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=137.66s)]
*  It's bankrupting the state. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  And inflation—Massachusetts is now the second most expensive state to live in in the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  Regular people are being priced out of the economy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=149.94s)]
*  Those two big issues didn't exist six years ago. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=152.73999999999998s)]
*  And Elizabeth Warren is losing support every day because of her hyperpartisan politics [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=155.54s)]
*  and her loyalty to just a particular agenda. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=160.66s)]
*  Real quickly, do you think you're going to get any national support from the Senate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=163.54s)]
*  Republican Committee or anything like that? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=167.18s)]
*  Are they going to back your race? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=169.42s)]
*  Do they think it's winnable? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=170.66s)]
*  Well, listen, I've already proved I won the primary by 65 percent. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=171.94s)]
*  Big showing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=177.26s)]
*  People are coming together. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=178.26s)]
*  And my biggest obstacle, Lawrence, isn't Elizabeth Warren. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=179.54s)]
*  I've challenged her to five debates. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=183.18s)]
*  I relish when I stand on that debate stage toe-to-toe with her. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=184.8s)]
*  It's the perception of Massachusetts, oh, it's liberal, and she can't be beaten. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=188.38s)]
*  Once I break that perception, I have no doubt that people are going to come to me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=192.86s)]
*  And if you don't mind, John Deaton for Senate.com, I need their help. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=197.22000000000003s)]
*  I can win this race. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=200.86s)]
*  I wouldn't be in it if I couldn't. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=201.86s)]
*  John, it's a pleasure. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=203.3s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=204.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=205.3s)]
*  We'll be following your race. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tAWgClfmq4&t=206.3s)]
