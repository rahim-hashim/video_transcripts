# Fmr Israeli Prime Minister sends message: 'Do not tell us to stop in the middle'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY)
*  We're joined now by former Israel Prime Minister, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=0.0s)]
*  Naftali Bennett joins us now to react. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=2.96s)]
*  He's live with us here on set. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=4.64s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thanks for being here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=7.3s)]
*  You're here meeting with members of Congress [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=9.24s)]
*  and others here in the States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=10.64s)]
*  What's your message from Israel right now? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=11.48s)]
*  We've got a job to do. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=14.48s)]
*  We were attacked by a savage, barbaric terror organization, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=16.22s)]
*  which murdered, raped, burnt 1,400 Israelis, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=22.42s)]
*  women, babies, and we will not tolerate a terror state [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=28.340000000000003s)]
*  next to us, and we need to get the job done. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=34.660000000000004s)]
*  We'll do the job. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  We're not asking anyone else to do it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=38.46s)]
*  What we are telling everyone, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=40.82s)]
*  do not tell us to stop in the middle. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=42.5s)]
*  Are you concerned that those voices will get louder? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=45.3s)]
*  And how, is there any hesitation, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=48.24s)]
*  or is there any differences inside the Israeli government [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=51.24s)]
*  about finishing this fight? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=56.32s)]
*  Wall to wall, from the left to the right, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=57.62s)]
*  religious, secular, all Israelis are united [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  with one understanding that there will be no more [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=64.2s)]
*  a Hamas state on our door. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  We lived with that for about 15 years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=72.69999999999999s)]
*  We gotta do the job. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=76.5s)]
*  Just imagine, I was here in 9-11 in Manhattan, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  and imagine if Al-Qaeda wasn't in Afghanistan, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=81.24s)]
*  in Mexico, on your border. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=84.46s)]
*  Would America allow that to happen? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=87.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=89.86s)]
*  So we're gonna complete the job, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  and we will not appreciate anyone asking us [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=93.38s)]
*  to stop in the middle. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=97.64s)]
*  You know this stuff firsthand. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=99.74s)]
*  You were a company commander in a special operations unit. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=100.72s)]
*  You were involved in fighting in the Second Intifada [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=102.82s)]
*  in the Lebanese War as well. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=105.56s)]
*  What's it like for those guys going into Gaza right now? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=107.62s)]
*  Well, it's tough. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=110.46s)]
*  I lost my best friend in Lebanon, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=111.32s)]
*  but I'll tell you that it's the job of soldiers [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=114.78s)]
*  to go in and fight, including being in harm's way, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=118.66s)]
*  in order for civilians to never have to be slaughtered. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=123.22s)]
*  One story that keeps on pounding me every day [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=127.82s)]
*  is right now, there's Abigail Edan. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=132.26s)]
*  She's four years old, and she lost her two parents [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=136.22s)]
*  on that day of slaughter, on that Saturday. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=141.66000000000003s)]
*  And her older brother and sister, Amalia and Michael, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  they hid in a cupboard while the terrorists [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  killed the parents, and they are alive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  And Abigail right now, on her own, is in Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  She's being held hostage, a four-year-old girl. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=159.22000000000003s)]
*  My youngest girl is called Abigail, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=164.02s)]
*  and I cannot imagine her being alone [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=166.46s)]
*  after her parents were slaughtered in front of her eyes [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=170.98s)]
*  in the hands of this terrorist group. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  There are 230 hostages, babies. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=177.1s)]
*  There's Kfir, who's six months old, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=181.78s)]
*  a six-months-old hostage. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=185.38s)]
*  We will complete this job. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=187.66s)]
*  This is the job of the Jewish state. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  We were taken by surprise, and that is not okay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  But now we're, we collected ourselves, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  and we're fighting back, and we'll complete the job, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=201.58s)]
*  which is to eliminate Hamas and bring home all the hostages. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=203.82s)]
*  How staggered is it for you to see, then, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=207.54s)]
*  these pro-Hamas, you saw Hezbollah flag, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=209.58s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protests outside the White House? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=213.06s)]
*  Israel's biggest ally with those kind of protests? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=216.0s)]
*  Well, I know that widespread American people are good people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=219.18s)]
*  There are people who believe in freedom, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=224.06s)]
*  in liberty, in the pursuit of happiness. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=226.56s)]
*  And I can only assume that the people out there [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=229.9s)]
*  are, they themselves are either radical Islamic believers, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=236.1s)]
*  and then I've got not much to say, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=241.58s)]
*  or ignorant people who simply don't know what we're facing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=243.46s)]
*  We are fighting total evil, the very pure epitome of evil. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  And we have to continue. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=254.5s)]
*  I hope Americans, the widespread Americans [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=256.98s)]
*  don't accept this horrible behavior. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=259.74s)]
*  Well said. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=265.54s)]
*  I have to ask you an exit question, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=266.38s)]
*  just domestic Israeli politics. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=267.26s)]
*  You were the chief of staff for Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=269.14s)]
*  but then a political opponent. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=271.22s)]
*  What does his future look like, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=272.92s)]
*  Netanyahu as prime minister in Israel? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=274.54s)]
*  I don't want to get into that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=279.1s)]
*  He's the prime minister of Israel right now, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=281.14s)]
*  and I back his government, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=283.26s)]
*  notwithstanding all disagreements. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  We have one government right now, and one army, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=289.06s)]
*  and we've got an enemy that we have to defeat. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=292.14s)]
*  I can tell you that all Israelis are united. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=294.58s)]
*  What will happen the day after, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=297.08s)]
*  I think most people understand, but we'll wait for that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=298.29999999999995s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=301.46s)]
*  Naftali Bennett, thank you for sharing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  your perspective with us this morning. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=304.28s)]
*  Thank you, Pete. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=305.58s)]
*  God bless. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJlvY0HBvY&t=306.41999999999996s)]
