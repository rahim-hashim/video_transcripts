# This has really huge geopolitical implications: Rachel Campos Duffy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM)
*  Well, listen, there was somebody who was in Vermont, a very liberal state, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=0.0s)]
*  went with his family, JD Vance, skiing. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  And boy, the Vermonters were not very friendly and welcoming. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=6.68s)]
*  I don't think any conservatives would want to go to Vermont skiing anymore. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=11.56s)]
*  Look at this. Shocking, shocking to find out that the state that keeps sending us [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Bernie Sanders decided to turn out in support of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  against JD Vance because of the showdown in the White House yesterday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Peter, what bugs me about this is it's like if he was, you know, if he was like, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=32.72s)]
*  I get I think families should be off limits. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=37.08s)]
*  Hunter Biden sold out the country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=39.52s)]
*  There was a reason to talk about it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=41.4s)]
*  These kids are like four and two. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Like, why why are they bothering this man on his ski vacation? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=45.64s)]
*  And by the end, I don't think it looks good for the state. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  You know what you do? I think we should just go down the line, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=51.44s)]
*  have an intrepid reporter go down the line and ask it to a pop quiz, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=54.24s)]
*  get every single one of them to identify Ukraine on a map. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=57.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, maybe they all know it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  And I'd be very impressed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=65.6s)]
*  I would that would make me very happy that all those schoolchildren, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=66.68s)]
*  all those people knew where Ukraine was. But I know I'd be interesting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=69.64s)]
*  But this actually kind of does surprise me because the local reports say [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=73.0s)]
*  there were one doubt between a thousand and three thousand people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=76.48s)]
*  There are only so many Saturdays left in the season. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=80.16s)]
*  And it looks like the snow when you play the video, the snow doesn't look great. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=83.84s)]
*  Maybe maybe the runs are just too slaked over [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=88.28s)]
*  or you can already see the dirt through. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=92.0s)]
*  But you would think that these guys have something else to do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=94.44s)]
*  The other thing about this is, as we have learned from years of protest coverage, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  that they're not going to get anywhere close to JD Vance and his family [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  on the ski run like the Secret Service would keep them way back at best. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=107.4s)]
*  They're going to get the closest they would get to him is like an SUV, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=113.32s)]
*  probably 50 feet. You think he's looking out the window? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=117.32s)]
*  He's looking at his phone to see all these memes from the Oval Office [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=120.44s)]
*  meeting the other day. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  And what was the moral of the story from the Oval Office meeting? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=124.64s)]
*  JD Vance's number one rule, just be polite, say please, say thank you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=128.2s)]
*  I don't think they're going to reach him with a with a sign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=132.48s)]
*  What are they protesting? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=134.88s)]
*  Are they protesting that we're cutting spending? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Are they protesting that we're uncovering corruption? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  Are they protesting peace in the world? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=141.68s)]
*  What are they protesting? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=143.52s)]
*  I think they're just mad. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  I think they're just really mad at the Trump locomotive that is going through. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=146.52s)]
*  They say, but I do think that that these protests highlight [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=151.12s)]
*  just how deeply like nobody didn't see that exchange. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  And I think we have a clip of it. Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=163.4s)]
*  You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=166.36s)]
*  You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=168.96s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  This country that's back to you far more than a lot of people said [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=175.96s)]
*  they should have. Have you said thank you once? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=180.68s)]
*  There's a lot of times. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=182.88s)]
*  No, in this entire meeting, you said thank you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  Every time you watch it, it's like watching it the first time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=187.24s)]
*  Honestly, you don't get tired of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  My favorite moment, you are gambling with World War Three. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=191.44s)]
*  And again, this this has like really huge geopolitical implications. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=194.96s)]
*  You talked about do these protesters out there? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=198.44s)]
*  Can they even locate Ukraine on a map? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=200.56s)]
*  Do those protesters know that this war in Ukraine has brought Russia and China [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=202.48s)]
*  together? Do they understand any of the things that are that are at play here? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=207.08s)]
*  And what's more important to Zelensky [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=211.96s)]
*  ending the war or trying to get a better deal out of the United States? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  I heard from somebody who was involved in the negotiations [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=219.12s)]
*  in the Oval Office yesterday after the show. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=221.88s)]
*  Nothing is going to happen until he makes a public apology [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=224.28s)]
*  for the way that he acted in the Oval Office. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=227.28s)]
*  Nothing. And he keeps he's now on a world tour [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=229.72s)]
*  where he will not just stand there in front of a microphone and say, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=233.68s)]
*  I apologize. I accept responsibility for my actions in the Oval. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=237.32s)]
*  So I don't know what happens next. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=241.6s)]
*  Well, he did go to England and in England, they agreed to like [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=243.44s)]
*  give him money for the I guess in perpetuity like forever [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=247.32s)]
*  until this war is ended, which we know. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=251.44s)]
*  And I think they're going to give him money to build weapons in Ukraine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=253.48s)]
*  But even the capacity they have in Ukraine is to build weapons [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=257.16s)]
*  and the money they're given isn't going to last that long. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=262.0s)]
*  The Russians can outdo them in that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  And this will just get deeper and deeper. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=266.0s)]
*  Here's what Zelensky said on X yesterday. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=268.6s)]
*  He said, we are ready to sign the minerals agreement [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=271.04s)]
*  and it will be the first step towards security guarantees. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=273.68s)]
*  But it's not enough. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=276.36s)]
*  And we need more than just to ceasefire without security. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=277.72s)]
*  Guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  We've been fighting for three years in Ukraine. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=282.68s)]
*  People need to know that America is on our side. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  Maybe America needs to know you're on our side, because as you said, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=288.24s)]
*  he can't even say thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  And of course, the problem here is that the deal that he went to the White House [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  to sign was the exact deal that they have had in place for a week now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  And it's not changed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  It's the same one. He knows what it is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=305.0s)]
*  They wanted to sign it earlier. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=307.16s)]
*  But of course, of course, Zelensky's team wanted to have a big show of it [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=308.8s)]
*  and sign it in the White House. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=313.12s)]
*  And then they go in there, they blow it up and they now they don't have what they need. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=314.52s)]
*  And now they still need what they don't have. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=319.52s)]
*  And Michael Goodwin's got a great timeline in the New York Post today [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  where he went back and looked at what Democratic lawmakers were saying [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  after their meeting with Zelensky right before the Oval Office. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  These Democrats that he met with were telling him to not accept the deal. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't go to the Oval Office and sign anything with Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  And so they kind of I believe that the way Goodwin describes it, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=340.64s)]
*  they let him off a cliff and they did. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=343.76s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  After they had all agreed in principle to the deal. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=347.76s)]
*  And let's not forget, this is the collusion. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  We spent how many years talking about freaking collusion. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=354.92s)]
*  And it was all these exact same Democrats who are now colluding with Zelensky [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  on this very issue, who who were attacking and ultimately [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=363.08s)]
*  impeached President Trump about collusion. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=368.12s)]
*  Is collusion not a rare earth mineral? Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ljHdLFQIsM&t=370.76s)]
