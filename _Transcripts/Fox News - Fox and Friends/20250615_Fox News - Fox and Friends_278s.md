# ATF special agent confident Minnesota lawmaker attack suspect will be found
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4)
*  We're back with two Minnesota state lawmakers shot in their homes and what officials say [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=0.0s)]
*  was a targeted assassination. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=7.8s)]
*  The suspect escaped after exchanging gunfire with police with an active manhunt for the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=9.6s)]
*  shooter still ongoing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=14.44s)]
*  Special agent from the ATF St. Paul Field Division, Travis Riddle, joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=16.12s)]
*  Agent Riddle, I know that you're involved in the investigation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=22.0s)]
*  You're limited in what you can say. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=24.84s)]
*  To take us back and to understand, where are you guys on finding this individual? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=26.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=33.28s)]
*  First of all, I want to speak on behalf of all ATF members when I say that we all agree [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=34.28s)]
*  the victims of this senseless tragedy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  As far as where we stand at this point, we're still actively seeking the suspect in conjunction [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=41.84s)]
*  with our local, state and federal partners. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  So I understand, I've seen the picture. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=51.24s)]
*  He's got a mask. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  He's wearing an officer's uniform on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  We even heard a report that he may have been in a vehicle that appeared to be like an officer's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=55.12s)]
*  car. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=58.48s)]
*  How was he identified as the suspect following the incident? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=59.48s)]
*  Following the exchange of gunfire at the second residence when he fled on foot, there was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=67.36s)]
*  identification that was located at the scene that helped us ID the suspect. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=72.72s)]
*  We were also able, utilizing our e-trace system on recovered firearms, also confirmed the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=77.48s)]
*  identity of the suspect. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=83.64s)]
*  So this is a political appointee, someone's involved in politics. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  It seems to be a very politically motivated action here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  What is the threat to the public as long as he's at large? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=94.8s)]
*  Well potentially there's always a threat. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=99.6s)]
*  He is considered armed and dangerous. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  At this time we do not know what his access is to additional weapons. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=104.84s)]
*  Additionally, the violent assault targeting the Minnesota legislature is deeply troubling [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  and it's wholly unacceptable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=117.04s)]
*  Such acts of violence and intimidation threaten our democracy and have absolutely no place [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  in our political system or in our communities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=124.56s)]
*  I know that he sent a text message, allegedly to his roommates, kind of alluding to what [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=127.2s)]
*  had happened and kind of, I guess, giving them cover saying you didn't know anything [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=132.72s)]
*  about this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  In the investigation, is there anything public that shows this could have been seen coming? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  At this point in the investigation I have absolutely no information on whether or not [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  this was going to be preventable. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  Is he believed to still be armed? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  You said some weapons were left behind. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=153.92s)]
*  We are anticipating that he is still potentially armed, yes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any indication that he is receiving help from anyone or group? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Not at this time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=166.16s)]
*  The investigation is still ongoing and we are still exploring all avenues. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=167.32s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=171.24s)]
*  It seems like this happened in a neighborhood and he was able to flee and now there is a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=172.72s)]
*  manhunt. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=176.36s)]
*  Can you explain the situation? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=177.36s)]
*  Did he get into the woods? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=178.36s)]
*  Was there a large track of land behind the neighborhood? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=179.36s)]
*  How was he able to get away it seems? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=182.72s)]
*  Well, you are correct. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  It is a neighborhood. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=188.12s)]
*  It is not wooded. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=189.12s)]
*  When officers arrived, they exchanged gunfire with the suspect and they didn't have the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=192.48s)]
*  house surrounded. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=199.72s)]
*  There was only a couple of officers who responded. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=200.72s)]
*  So while they were seeking cover and also trying to render aid to victims, the suspect [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  was able to flee from the residence undetected. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=208.64s)]
*  Now we are hearing that this suspect owned a security company. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=211.48s)]
*  Obviously he dressed as a police officer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=215.56s)]
*  Can you help us understand, did he have any tactical advantage to execute this and tort [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=219.2s)]
*  law enforcement or is it simply a little bit of he got lucky and was able to get away? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=224.56s)]
*  I think in this particular instance he just got lucky and got away. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=230.56s)]
*  I don't believe his tactical expertise would have surpassed the law enforcement response. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=233.72s)]
*  Last question, which is obviously the most important one, are you confident this person [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=239.64s)]
*  will be found soon? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=243.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=245.28s)]
*  With the number of agencies and officers and agents that are dedicated to this case, I'm [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  very confident that we're going to be able to successfully get this to an end. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=252.4s)]
*  Travis Riddle, ATF, thank you so much for joining us and good luck in everything to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  capture this alleged killer. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=262.52s)]
*  Thank you, Joey. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=265.8s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=266.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROO5VFkwA4&t=277.04s)]
