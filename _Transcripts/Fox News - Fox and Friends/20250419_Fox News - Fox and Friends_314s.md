# Trump addresses Jill Biden's influence on Joe behind-the-scenes: 'He didn't have a clue'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk)
*  Just how involved was former first lady Jill Biden in running Joe Biden's White House? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=0.0s)]
*  Our own Rachel Campos Duffy asked President Trump what he thought in an exclusive interview [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=8.32s)]
*  on Fox Noticias. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=13.06s)]
*  Was Jill running the White House? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=15.76s)]
*  You know, look, she was certainly involved because he gave her the last meeting to present [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=17.6s)]
*  over with the cabinet, the cabinet meeting. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=24.0s)]
*  Was she the auto pen? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=26.04s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=27.04s)]
*  She was, they had a lot of bad people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=29.16s)]
*  They had a lot of radical left lunatics in there and I think he was perfect. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  He was perfect for them because he didn't have a clue. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=34.38s)]
*  Here to react, Fox and Friends Weekend co-hosts Rachel Campos Duffy and Charlie Hurt. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=38.92s)]
*  Good morning to both of you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=43.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=44.08s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=45.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=46.08s)]
*  Congratulations on that great interview. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=47.08s)]
*  What is your sense? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=48.66s)]
*  Who do you think was working behind the scenes? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=49.66s)]
*  Well, I asked that question on behalf of Charlie, who is often called Jill, Dr. Auto Pen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=53.96s)]
*  So listen, you know, it could be senior advisors. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=59.68s)]
*  He thinks it was, you know, wokey senior advisors. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=63.24s)]
*  Other people think that by the end, you know, Jill Biden, who'd been pressuring him to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=66.44s)]
*  actually run since the beginning. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=70.56s)]
*  A lot of people critical of her role and having him there when he was clearly not up for the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=72.84s)]
*  job. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=77.32s)]
*  But think about this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=78.32s)]
*  And between 40 and 60 of them were signed by Auto Pen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=80.32s)]
*  So the question is, you know, are those null and void? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  Because back in 2005, the DOJ said that the Auto Pen was OK for administrative documents, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=89.63999999999999s)]
*  but could not and should not be used for pardons. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=96.56s)]
*  So there's a lot of questions besides all the sort of political ones. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=99.22s)]
*  There's some real questions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  Are those pardons valid? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  Are some of the policies that he put in place valid? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=107.8s)]
*  And who was running the White House? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=111.48s)]
*  Whoever was Auto Pen, one thing we know for sure, that person is responsible for degrading [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=114.16s)]
*  our country economically, culturally and spiritually. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And Charlie, do you think it was Dr. Biden, Jill Biden? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=124.0s)]
*  You call her Dr. Auto Pen? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=127.72s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny, you know, when you look at his answer on the one hand, it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=129.2s)]
*  sort of looks like he's sort of being kind of gallant and respectful to the previous [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  First Lady and he's just kind of like sort of giving her some cover. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  But then if you if you look closely, you also start to think maybe what he's thinking about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=143.04s)]
*  is he's thinking about all the other people he suspects were actually the Auto Pen. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=148.76s)]
*  And that's why he pivots and starts talking about all the bad people that were in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=154.48s)]
*  office. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=159.0s)]
*  And I think Rachel's exactly right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=160.0s)]
*  There was like a team of them and there was no regular order to how they did this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=162.4s)]
*  And you had some of these cases where where you had the Auto Pen or Dr. Auto Pen signing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  pardons and Joe Biden wasn't even in the United States. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=175.84s)]
*  He was out of the country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  And if that's not lawlessness at the highest level, you know, I don't know what is. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=181.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=186.28s)]
*  I mean, Rachel, don't you remember when some of the staffers were asked questions and they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=187.28s)]
*  would say, well, this is what the president's doing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=190.88s)]
*  And then the president would be asked about it a day later. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=193.24s)]
*  And he had no clue. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=196.28s)]
*  So it was almost like they were making decisions and just telling him what what he was going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=197.96s)]
*  to say to the public. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=201.7s)]
*  But they forgot to fill him in on a few things. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=202.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=205.44s)]
*  And we all still remember that famous interview that Barack Obama gave where he said, you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  know, my dream, my fantasy is to run the government from sort of behind the curtain, have a third [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=210.6s)]
*  term where I don't have to, you know, do all the boring, you know, stuff that the president [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=215.88s)]
*  has to do and sit through all those meetings. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=220.68s)]
*  But I can still direct it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=223.2s)]
*  And I will say this, you know, it's it's it's just a massive contrast to see, you know, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=225.0s)]
*  the question, of course, isn't just the pen. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=229.92s)]
*  Who is directing the government? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  Who is behind these policies? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=233.16s)]
*  And one thing you can say about Donald Trump is no one has any question that he is directing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=235.16s)]
*  these policies. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=240.38s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=241.38s)]
*  Running this government. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=242.46s)]
*  And I can tell you personally, because I'm in a house where there's a secretary getting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=243.7s)]
*  phone calls at, you know, nine in the morning to sometimes nine at night. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=248.42s)]
*  And they're talking about policy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=253.14s)]
*  I'm even amazed at how in the weeds Donald Trump is with the policies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  Nobody can say that everybody's image of Joe Biden is him laying on the beach. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=259.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  And I remember the Easter Bunny. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  We have the Easter Egg Roll coming up. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=267.36s)]
*  The Easter Bunny is trying to push him along. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=268.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  All right, Charlie, what's coming up on your show this weekend? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  So we've got a great weekend show. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=275.06s)]
*  It's Easter weekend. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=277.66s)]
*  Most importantly, we've got Franklin Reverend Franklin Graham, of course, Dana Perino, Dr. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=278.66s)]
*  Nicole Sapphire. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=284.1s)]
*  And then we continue our Faith and Friends series with Josiah Queen and Rhett Walker. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  You're not going to want to miss it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=290.88s)]
*  I'm loving that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=291.88s)]
*  I think it's great that you all are doing that during the season. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=292.94s)]
*  Thank you so much and happy Easter to both of you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=295.38s)]
*  Great to see you and happy Easter. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  Happy Easter. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=298.94s)]
*  Happy Easter. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=299.94s)]
*  Yes, and to you too, Charlie. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXWN0ZA_gk&t=300.94s)]
