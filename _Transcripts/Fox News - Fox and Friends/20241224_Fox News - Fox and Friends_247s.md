# Rand Paul exposes Biden admin for wasting $1 trillion
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI)
*  Joe Biden's wild spending spree exposed in Senator Rand Paul's 10th annual [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=0.0s)]
*  Festivus report showing the more than one trillion dollars in government [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=5.48s)]
*  waste. Making the list this year of course you got to have your Sesame [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=10.84s)]
*  Street show in Iraq, a multi-million dollar pickleball complex in Las Vegas, a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=13.76s)]
*  drag cabaret show on ice, and of course border security for dot dot dot Paraguay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=18.32s)]
*  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul joins us now. Senator this is an annual list [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=24.96s)]
*  you do. You've got a lot of problems with government people to quote Seinfeld [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=29.94s)]
*  further. How tough is it to target and find the entries on this list? You know I [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=33.82s)]
*  got a lot of problems with big spenders in both parties and here's the thing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  everywhere you look you find more of this stuff. A trillion dollars that means [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=46.14s)]
*  we found a lot of waste but it's everywhere. It's in all the big [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=50.42s)]
*  departments in the Department of State, it's in NIH, it's in the National [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  Science Foundation and people wonder why does it exist every year? We have [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=58.26s)]
*  this Department of Doge are they going to be able to get rid of it? Well the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=62.98s)]
*  only way to get rid of it is to spend less money. So if you give the National [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=65.94s)]
*  Science Foundation four billion one year and then you increase it to eight [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  billion it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand you're gonna [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=74.97999999999999s)]
*  get more waste not less. This has been going on since the 70s but it has [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=79.42s)]
*  exploded but you have to be willing to cut spending for the overall department. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=83.86s)]
*  NIH will have more waste if you give them more money. They spent three million [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=88.82s)]
*  dollars studying what kids do when they look at ads for food on Facebook. So they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=94.14s)]
*  had a whole bunch of kids look at ads for food on Facebook and that was three [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=102.02s)]
*  million dollars worth. I mean hundreds of thousands of dollars to drill holes [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  into cats head, spin them around rapidly and study motion sickness. Sounds more [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=110.3s)]
*  like animal cruelty than it actually sounds like an experiment but the list [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=115.22s)]
*  goes on and on. And that's not to mention I mean you have stolen COVID relief [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=118.82s)]
*  funds eight million. One guy from Florida did it to buy an island you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=124.58s)]
*  mentioned the cat the list does go on and on but you also alluded to this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=128.94s)]
*  senator. Do you think your tradition ends this year? In other words is this the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=132.1s)]
*  year that Doge eliminates the need for you to go through and make this list [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=137.74s)]
*  because they've done it over the course of the intervening 365 days. Ultimately [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=142.46s)]
*  it takes Congress. Congress has to get rid of the spending. Doge can point out [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  the spending problems and the waste the same way I've been pointing it out but [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=152.94s)]
*  the reason it's not eliminated is they don't have the votes to get rid of the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  spending. So I am very hopeful that Doge will draw attention to this the same [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  way I've been drawing attention to it but I'll give you an example. About a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=165.1s)]
*  year ago there was a chip spill a bill to subsidize microchip semiconductors [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=168.94s)]
*  in the United States. Well in that bill they doubled the size of the National [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=174.54s)]
*  Science Foundation. Now the National Science Foundation is the one that's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=178.54s)]
*  famous for doing a study on whether tequila or gin makes people more [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=181.78s)]
*  aggressive. So they fed fish half of tequila and the other half of the fish [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=186.3s)]
*  gin and they decided which made the fish more aggressive. That's the National [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=191.38s)]
*  Science Foundation. Most of the terrible wasteful projects are crazy stuff and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  experiments going on is National Science Foundation. In the chip spill all the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=201.38s)]
*  Democrats and half the Republicans voted to double the size of National Science [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=206.3s)]
*  Foundation. So why is there more waste? Because the idiots in Congress keep [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=210.42s)]
*  giving them more money. Well it will be interesting to see again what happens [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=215.14s)]
*  when Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. Very [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=219.3s)]
*  different from what we've experienced the last 96 hours in Congress. Will this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  waste go away? Will you be needed on Christmas Eve next year? We will see. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul enjoy the day and the week with your family and we thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBonUyBt4DI&t=233.10000000000002s)]
