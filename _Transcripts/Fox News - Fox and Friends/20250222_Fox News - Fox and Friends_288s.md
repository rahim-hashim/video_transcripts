# AG Pam Bondi reviews classified Epstein documents
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU)
*  Look at this, Pam Bondi asked about the Epstein files. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=0.0s)]
*  She said, the Epstein files are on my desk. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=4.04s)]
*  I remember asking Donald Trump about this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=9.8s)]
*  back in the summertime. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=12.8s)]
*  I asked him if he was gonna release all of these files. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=14.52s)]
*  Do we have that video, guys? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Americans have lost a lot of trust in institutions, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=21.36s)]
*  and I think there's been a lot of discussion, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=23.92s)]
*  especially online and especially with young people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  How do we rebuild that trust in institutions? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=27.28s)]
*  The CIA, the FBI, all those institutions. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=33.36s)]
*  Some people think that one way to build trust [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=34.18s)]
*  is to declassify things that everyone's talking about. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=37.44s)]
*  I know you talked earlier about, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  I don't wanna be a conspiracy theorist. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=41.08s)]
*  So if you were president, would you declassify, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=42.68s)]
*  you can answer yes or no to these. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=45.72s)]
*  Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=49.96s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=50.8s)]
*  Yeah, I did a lot of it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=52.44s)]
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=54.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=57.44s)]
*  I guess I would. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=59.4s)]
*  I think that less so because you don't know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  you don't wanna affect people's lives [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=63.36s)]
*  if it's phony stuff in there [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=64.88s)]
*  because there's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  But I think I would, or at least I'd- [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=70.08s)]
*  Do you think that would restore trust? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=71.56s)]
*  Help restore trust? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=73.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about Epstein so much as I do the others. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=74.0s)]
*  Certainly about the way he died, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=76.48s)]
*  it would be interesting to find out what happened there [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  because that was a weird situation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  and the cameras didn't happen to be working, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=81.6s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=83.32s)]
*  But you had to go a long way toward that one. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  Great questions. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=87.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=88.08s)]
*  You press them, and now we've got Attorney General [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=89.44s)]
*  Pam Bondi talking yesterday about what she plans to do [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=91.28s)]
*  with these files now sitting on her desk. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  Here's what she says. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  This is something Donald Trump has talked about. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=98.97999999999999s)]
*  The DOJ may be releasing the list [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=103.38s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=105.52s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=107.0s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=110.08s)]
*  I'm reviewing that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=112.52s)]
*  I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=113.36s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=116.6s)]
*  because that was done at the directive of the president [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=118.52s)]
*  from all of these agencies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=120.6s)]
*  So have you seen anything there? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=121.92s)]
*  You said, oh my gosh. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=123.48s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=126.08s)]
*  That you, I think you spurned that to happen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=128.12s)]
*  And now Pam Bondi's being pretty specific [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=132.28s)]
*  that she's reviewing it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=134.92s)]
*  So that's not clear that we're getting all of it, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=136.4s)]
*  but it's not just FC, MLK, JFK, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=138.84s)]
*  and all of these things. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=142.76s)]
*  Look, the Epstein stuff is serious stuff. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=144.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about children, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  we're talking about sexual abuse. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely, and remember we're talking about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  a number of different potential crime scenes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  and videos that have been collected. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=154.72s)]
*  One of the big differences I think now [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=156.92s)]
*  compared to the past four years is now there seems [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=159.48s)]
*  to be a real aggressive action toward transparency. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  As we've been talking about all morning long, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  I do wanna know where those tapes went. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  I do wanna know what happened out in New Mexico. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=171.04s)]
*  I would like to know are there other women and children [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=174.44s)]
*  who've been impacted, for example, by this Epstein, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=177.48s)]
*  not just by Jeffrey Epstein himself, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=180.0s)]
*  but also by Justland Maxwell, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=182.0s)]
*  and by others who may or may not have been party [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=183.88s)]
*  to these circumstances on the east side of New York. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=186.44s)]
*  So I think transparency, sunlight, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=189.6s)]
*  what they say is the best disinfectant. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=193.0s)]
*  It's the best disinfectant. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=193.84s)]
*  Let me tell you why I think this is important. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it's important because we have a generation [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=197.0s)]
*  of young people who have been through the lies of COVID [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=199.44s)]
*  that deeply impacted them, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=202.12s)]
*  have seen all of these things transpire [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=203.52s)]
*  that we've been talking about, but at very formative ages. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=206.34s)]
*  And this is their chance to believe [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=209.04s)]
*  that their government is honest again. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=212.48s)]
*  I think if these are not released in their entirety [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=215.2s)]
*  and if this promise is not kept, and by the way, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=218.6s)]
*  I believe President Trump is gonna keep this promise, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=221.56s)]
*  but I think this is about restoring trust [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=224.52s)]
*  for young people in democracy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=227.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=229.84s)]
*  It's such a good point because we've had these drones [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=230.68s)]
*  and we've talked about here on the couch and elsewhere, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=233.2s)]
*  these mysterious drones everywhere in the Biden administration. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=235.28s)]
*  Stonewall, Stonewall, Stonewall, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=238.32s)]
*  Trump administration comes in right away, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=239.9s)]
*  is like, okay, here's what that was. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=241.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=243.04s)]
*  And put this like, why was that so hard? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=243.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=245.32s)]
*  And you have a great point too with young viewers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=246.16s)]
*  This is about the erosion of trust [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=247.8s)]
*  with young people and their government. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=250.68s)]
*  And that's not a good thing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=252.88s)]
*  That needs to be reversed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=254.2s)]
*  And I think transparency, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=255.48s)]
*  they can see tangible transparency [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  when they're looking into whether it's Epstein or RFK or JFK. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  They're like, okay, now I can see it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=263.96s)]
*  Now I can see it for myself. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=265.38s)]
*  I can read it and therefore, you're reading sources. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=266.56s)]
*  There's a reason for government to have some secrets, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=269.12s)]
*  but a lot of this is just about protecting powerful people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=271.7s)]
*  And this is a chance to reverse that, so. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=274.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=277.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBnngnwukBU&t=285.48s)]
