# Family of DC crash victim praises Trump for overhauling air traffic control system
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E)
*  This comes as we mark a tragic milestone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=0.0s)]
*  100 days have passed since the mid-air collision [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=2.6s)]
*  over Washington, D.C. that left 67 dead. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=5.76s)]
*  The families of those victims still demanding accountability. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  So our next guest lost their son, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=13.64s)]
*  American Airlines pilot, First Officer Sam Lilly [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=15.56s)]
*  on that horrific night, and they say they're grateful [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  for the President Trump's administration's plans [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=20.76s)]
*  to overhaul our air traffic control system. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=23.36s)]
*  Sam's father and stepmother, Tim and Sherri Lilly, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=25.88s)]
*  have been kind enough to join us this morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=29.36s)]
*  Ma'am and sir, thanks so much for joining the program [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=32.04s)]
*  this morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=34.72s)]
*  We continue to pray for your family as y'all grieve [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=35.56s)]
*  this tragic loss of your son. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=38.68s)]
*  Thank you so much for having us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=42.88s)]
*  It's an honor to be here to tell Sam's story. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=45.04s)]
*  So Tim, let's talk about what the President said [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=47.92s)]
*  when this first happened. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=51.16s)]
*  He said, your son did nothing wrong. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  The pilots did zero wrong. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=55.24s)]
*  That it was the helicopter that was in the wrong space. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=58.1s)]
*  Now we have more evidence to suggest that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=61.46s)]
*  What do you want to change in the system? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=64.26s)]
*  Well, I think the Army has a lot of work to do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=68.68s)]
*  There's cultural problem in the Army, in Army aviation, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=72.08s)]
*  where they need to get their recruiting and retention up [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=75.78s)]
*  for Army aviation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=81.42s)]
*  They've lost a lot of experience, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  and we just need to change some [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  of the cultural problems there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=86.62s)]
*  They had normalized some unsafe acts, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  but more than that, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  I just really want to thank President Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=92.86s)]
*  for his leadership in putting forth this program, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  because we want to really make sure [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=99.06s)]
*  that no other family has to go through the loss [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=101.06s)]
*  that our family and the other 66 families have gone through. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=103.78s)]
*  Sam was just a terrific young man, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=108.94s)]
*  and he was at the prime of his life. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=110.98s)]
*  He was engaged to be married. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=114.22s)]
*  He was about to make captain. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=116.82s)]
*  Everybody loves Sam. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=118.66s)]
*  He's left a huge hole in our family. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=119.86s)]
*  We take sauce in knowing that Sam's name [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=123.22s)]
*  was written in the book. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=125.94s)]
*  And so he's flying now on wings of glory, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=126.9s)]
*  and we're gonna see him again, but we miss him terribly. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=130.74s)]
*  I miss him every day. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=135.04s)]
*  And you know, Tim, not only your dad, but you're a pilot. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=136.3s)]
*  I want to get your expertise, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=138.88s)]
*  Blackhawk in your background, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=139.94s)]
*  but Sherry, for both of you to come out [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=141.46s)]
*  and speak publicly so soon after the accident, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=143.34s)]
*  to probably play a role in fixing it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=145.62s)]
*  What went into that decision? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=149.22s)]
*  You know, Sam was really, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=152.66s)]
*  he was a very resilient and strong human being. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=155.74s)]
*  This is to honor him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=160.78s)]
*  This is really all driven by creating a legacy for him, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=162.1s)]
*  out of respect for his memory and the memory [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=166.66s)]
*  of all of the other families impacted [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=169.22s)]
*  by this tragic accident. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  You know, we have been so encouraged by the urgency [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=173.58s)]
*  that Secretary Duffy is bringing to this situation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=177.66000000000003s)]
*  I was in DC yesterday at the press conference, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=180.84s)]
*  and I was encouraged by that coalition [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=183.74s)]
*  that he's brought together of industry leaders, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=186.02s)]
*  trade associations, you know, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  executives from major aircraft manufacturers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=190.86s)]
*  I was just floored by the ability [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  that he has had to pull together [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=198.34s)]
*  such a diverse group of people who all share the same goal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=199.9s)]
*  And that's really a tribute to their recognition [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=204.38s)]
*  and regard for those families too. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=208.02s)]
*  Tom, I know he had a passion for flying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=210.9s)]
*  at a very young age. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=213.5s)]
*  He wanted to follow in your footsteps, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=214.62s)]
*  a 20-year veteran helicopter pilot as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=216.26s)]
*  And he was flying the American Airlines flight, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=219.62s)]
*  was about to get that promotion to captain. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=221.9s)]
*  Did he ever, when we see the videos of what Donald Trump, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=224.34s)]
*  what Duffy, what Sean Duffy is releasing, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=227.98s)]
*  those videos of this outdated equipment, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=231.58s)]
*  I'm very glad that they're being transparent, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=234.33999999999997s)]
*  but it's also scary because we all fly. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=235.5s)]
*  It affects everyone around our country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=238.22s)]
*  Did your son ever complain to you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=240.61999999999998s)]
*  about how outdated everything was, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=242.61999999999998s)]
*  and how did that affect him as a pilot? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  So yeah, Sam and I talked quite a bit [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=248.1s)]
*  about flights into DCA and Ronald Reagan International, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  and the challenges that come with that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=255.45999999999998s)]
*  Now, he didn't spend a lot of time [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=258.38s)]
*  in an air traffic control tower or at the TRACON, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=260.34s)]
*  so he probably didn't realize [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  just how outdated the system was. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=264.84s)]
*  But I could tell you, for instance, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=267.28s)]
*  I've been flying in and out of the New York area [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  for the last few days, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=272.2s)]
*  and we've been delayed every single day [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=273.2s)]
*  because the system just can't keep up with what's going on. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=275.96s)]
*  This thing was designed decades and decades ago, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=278.78s)]
*  and I'll tell you, Secretary Duffy, he gets it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=282.4s)]
*  We met with him just a few days after the accident. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  Everything that we asked for, he's taking action on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  I asked him to do this at the speed of business [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=290.4s)]
*  and not the speed of government, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=294.64s)]
*  and he's really coming through. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  We just want, every family deserves to know [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  that their loved one is on a commercial aircraft [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=302.67999999999995s)]
*  that's gonna get there safely. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  And so this goes both sides of the aisle. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=307.2s)]
*  We're just looking for support from everybody. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  I think all Americans deserve safe skies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=312.96s)]
*  Tim, how does it make you feel [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=316.76s)]
*  that we're still getting reports [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=318.2s)]
*  that they continue these VIP flights, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=319.84s)]
*  which as they say is for continuity of government, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=323.32s)]
*  these training exercises, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  but it's a similar incident that caused the collision, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=328.24s)]
*  and they just won't stop it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=332.96s)]
*  Have you heard anything about it? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=334.9s)]
*  Yeah, that was troubling for more than one reason. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=337.64s)]
*  I feel like the leadership had three months [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=341.96s)]
*  to relook at what they were doing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=345.92s)]
*  in and out of the Pentagon and around DCA. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  And I don't think that they took that moral obligation [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=351.12s)]
*  as serious as they should have, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=355.04s)]
*  because it only takes a minute to look at the procedure [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=356.32s)]
*  going out of the Pentagon and know [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smltkisnv1E&t=360.22s)]
