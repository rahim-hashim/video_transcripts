# Tammy Bruce: This is the only way we can make sure freedom of speech stays relevant
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A)
*  I don't think it turns around if Kamala Harris gets into office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=0.0s)]
*  I think they clamp down more. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=2.84s)]
*  I think the same stuff that they were trying to do with Twitter, they'll try to do with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=4.36s)]
*  something else, with other things. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=8.96s)]
*  They've already openly discussed it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=10.32s)]
*  You know, she's openly discussed that the same rules have to apply to Facebook, they [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=13.0s)]
*  have to apply to Twitter, and that Elon Musk could lose his privileges. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=16.32s)]
*  A grim prediction from Joe Rogan, who warns that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will declare [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=20.84s)]
*  war on free speech if they win the election, and that they've already talked about it publicly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=26.08s)]
*  Here to react, Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=32.08s)]
*  Tammy, so great to have you on, especially on this subject, on this topic, which is so [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=35.68s)]
*  important in this election. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=40.48s)]
*  In fact, I would say that this topic, along with government surveillance and unaccountability [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  in the federal government in general, these are the top issues of the election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=48.0s)]
*  They are. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=53.34s)]
*  Already, this election has been different because of Elon Musk. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=54.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=57.220000000000006s)]
*  Because of the change from Twitter to X. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=58.220000000000006s)]
*  There are so many issues that would never even have been allowed to be discussed, and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=60.18000000000001s)]
*  yet we are having those conversations. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=65.58s)]
*  And they're obsessed with social media because, without sounding trite here, information is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=67.98s)]
*  power. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=72.94s)]
*  And they don't want to have to explain things. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  They don't want the clips of Kamala Harris contradicting herself for years in front of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=76.7s)]
*  everyone all the time. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=82.82000000000001s)]
*  They want you to not have access to that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  They want to remake the news with each news cycle. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  They want to control what people hear. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=90.98s)]
*  And already, even despite the Supreme Court decision, the Biden administration, they look [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=92.58s)]
*  at the little bit of room they have, and they are going to have already begun to reconnect [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=97.18s)]
*  with social media outlets. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=102.82s)]
*  Now, they can't tell them what to do, but they never really could because of the First [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=104.66s)]
*  Amendment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=109.68s)]
*  They're obsessed with control of information because they know when people get the information, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=110.68s)]
*  the truth, that the Democrats and the left suffer. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=116.48s)]
*  So she has statedâ€”and this thing about privilege, Elon Musk's privilege, that is not given [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=120.2s)]
*  to any American by the government. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  And of course, with his association now with President Trump and a likely role in the administration, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=128.68s)]
*  that is the only way that we're going to make sure that freedom of speech, the First [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=134.12s)]
*  Amendment, stays relevant. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=137.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, Tim Walz claimed that the First Amendment does not apply to misinformation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=139.4s)]
*  Again, a fundamental misunderstanding of what our rights are when it comes to free speech, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=143.44000000000003s)]
*  where our rights come from, which are from God. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=148.4s)]
*  We're born free. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=151.4s)]
*  We're Americans. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=152.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just outrageous. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=153.4s)]
*  I just think this is so disqualifying as candidates. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=154.4s)]
*  If you believe this, you're not qualified to be the president and vice president of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=158.52s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  What you're doing is you're setting a table to convince and persuade Americans that the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  Constitution does not matter. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=169.88s)]
*  And that is an argument the left has made for decades, for 100-plus years around the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  world, that in fact, regular people aren't good enough to be able to run their own lives. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  They have to be guided by their superiors. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  And of course, the disturbed, who are in politics, which attracts a lot of the disturbed these [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=186.44s)]
*  days, believe that they are simply better and they just don't like what's happening. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=191.56s)]
*  And when we think about the border and crime, this is about punishing us for daring to not [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=196.72s)]
*  conform, to not comply. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, they're going to get a healthy dose of that, I think, on November 5th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Or daring to notice what they're doing and talk about it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=209.24s)]
*  You're not allowed to do that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=212.24s)]
*  Thank God for Elon Musk. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=213.24s)]
*  It would be a very different election without that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=214.88s)]
*  Tammy, Bruce, always great to have you on. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=216.88s)]
*  We love you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpyHTKZ-l7A&t=218.36s)]
