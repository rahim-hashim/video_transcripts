# Chaffetz: They're trying to 'screw over' Trump before he takes office
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU)
*  Well, as President-elect Trump gets ready to take office, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=0.0s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is issuing a stark warning [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=3.2s)]
*  to Congress about the future of the debt ceiling. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=6.44s)]
*  Treasury, this is what she says, she says, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=9.52s)]
*  Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=11.4s)]
*  between January 14th and January 23rd, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=13.92s)]
*  at which time it will be necessary for Treasury [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=16.64s)]
*  to start taking extraordinary measures. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=19.52s)]
*  I respectfully urge Congress to act [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=21.88s)]
*  to protect the full faith and credit of the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=24.28s)]
*  Here with more on this and what this means for you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=28.6s)]
*  and your wallet, Fox News contributor [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  and former Congressman Jason Chaffetz. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=33.44s)]
*  So what are these measures that Janet Yellen is talking about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=36.56s)]
*  when she says things are getting really bad? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, they could start slowing down the spending, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=44.72s)]
*  but you know, the Biden administration [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=46.88s)]
*  could have done this months ago. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=48.72s)]
*  They could have done it a year ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=49.96s)]
*  They didn't take care of business when they were supposed to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=51.84s)]
*  They'd been accelerating the spending. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  They haven't been slowing it down. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=56.64s)]
*  That is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=58.88s)]
*  They're trying to screw over Donald Trump [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  as he comes into office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  He's not even sworn in till January 20th, for goodness sake. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=64.64s)]
*  So they didn't do their business, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  and now Donald Trump's gonna have to come in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=70.4s)]
*  and help clean up this mess. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of bogus, right, when they say, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=73.8s)]
*  oh, we're running out of money. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=75.68s)]
*  We gave $64 billion to Ukraine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=76.84s)]
*  They just approved yesterday, or this past week, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=79.48s)]
*  1.2 billion for Ukraine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=82.68s)]
*  So don't tell me we're running out of money [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  as you're willing to give it to Ukraine [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=86.6s)]
*  to defend their borders. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=88.6s)]
*  Our borders are wide open, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=89.52s)]
*  and we're talking about STEM programs here, Jason Chaffetz. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=91.16s)]
*  We could have programs, job programs, STEM programs [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=94.72s)]
*  that employ our own people, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=98.08s)]
*  but we don't have the money somehow. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=100.52s)]
*  So how will this hamper the Trump administration? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  What do you expect that this dilemma [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=106.0s)]
*  of running out of money, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=109.32s)]
*  how will that impact Donald Trump [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=110.28s)]
*  and how will he deal with that? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=112.16s)]
*  Well, it kind of gets into the weeds. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=114.72s)]
*  It's sort of insider baseball, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=116.44s)]
*  but it has to do with how they score tax cuts. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=117.92s)]
*  So remember when we had the first round of Trump tax cuts, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=121.64s)]
*  everybody up and down the economic scale got tax cuts, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  When that happened, revenue to the Treasury went up, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=129.88s)]
*  but when you look at how they score it within Congress, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=134.0s)]
*  the Congressional Budget Office and whatnot, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=137.6s)]
*  when they look at that, they say, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=140.0s)]
*  they say, oh, tax cuts, that's missed revenue. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=141.56s)]
*  It's not. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=144.28s)]
*  That's what accelerates the economy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=145.12s)]
*  That's what drives revenue to the Treasury. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  So that's what we have to look at. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=149.24s)]
*  And so in order for Donald Trump [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=150.8s)]
*  to use the reconciliation package with Congress [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=152.84s)]
*  to actually implement things that are gonna be stimulative [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  to the economy and help drive down inflation, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=158.84s)]
*  you've got to do two things. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=162.4s)]
*  Put the tax cut in place, cut the spending, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=163.68s)]
*  but the scoring slows you down. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=166.28s)]
*  And that's what Donald Trump's gonna have to tackle [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=168.52s)]
*  right out of the shoots. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=172.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's no question. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=173.12s)]
*  We're just spending too much. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  We're printing too much money. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=175.48s)]
*  And at some point, these chickens [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=177.0s)]
*  are gonna come home to roost. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=178.64s)]
*  And so that leaves a lot on the plate [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=179.88s)]
*  when Donald Trump and the new Congress comes in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=182.56s)]
*  Let's talk about you, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=185.4s)]
*  because you are hosting Sunday Morning Futures this week. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  Who do you have and what do you guys plan to talk about? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=189.4s)]
*  Oh, I'm pretty excited about it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_hBh2zPWU&t=193.07999999999998s)]
