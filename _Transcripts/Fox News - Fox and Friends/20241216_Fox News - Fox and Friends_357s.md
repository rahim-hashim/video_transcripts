*  Hey, Peter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=26.18s)]

*  SoftBank, shows up at Mar-a-Lago today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=30.52s)]
*  He is expected to come with a commitment [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=32.64s)]
*  for $100 billion worth of investment in the US [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=34.92s)]
*  during Trump's next term, according to a report today [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=39.16s)]
*  by CNBC. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=41.76s)]
*  A lot of these CEO-level meetings have been more subtle. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=42.88s)]
*  Google's Sundar Pichai and Amazon's Jeff Bezos [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=45.72s)]
*  either have been or will be at Mar-a-Lago soon. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=50.64s)]
*  Their successes in the future could hinge [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=53.96s)]
*  on regulations that are coming down the pike [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=56.64s)]
*  for AI or space projects. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=59.0s)]
*  The President-elect himself made a rare trip [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=61.92s)]
*  out of Florida or New York to Maryland [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=64.72s)]
*  for Saturday's Army-Navy game. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=67.32s)]
*  Daniel Penny was there less than a week after a jury [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=69.6s)]
*  that could have sent him to jail didn't. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard was also there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=75.76s)]
*  So was Pete Hegseth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=78.0s)]
*  And so was Ron DeSantis, rumored to be the sec-death backup [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  if Hegseth doesn't make it through. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=83.92s)]
*  The advising consent process continues this week. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=86.2s)]
*  Linda McMahon, the Education Secretary pick, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=88.8s)]
*  will meet with senators. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=91.72s)]
*  And RFK Jr., the HHS pick, has 25 meetings lined up this week, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=93.28s)]
*  all with Republican senators. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of focus on his past vaccine skepticism, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  but the thing that could be the trickiest for him [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=104.56s)]
*  to navigate with the Republicans [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=106.44s)]
*  is his long history of being pro-choice on abortion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=108.6s)]
*  Key Republicans are gonna want commitments from him [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=112.52s)]
*  that if he runs HHS, he will not expand abortion access. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=115.2s)]
*  That is what this week is gonna be about. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=120.48s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  So Peter, you know, at the conclusion [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=123.68s)]
*  of many presidents' terms, they say, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=125.64s)]
*  during my term, I was able to create X million jobs [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=127.68s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=131.6s)]
*  Donald Trump is not even president yet, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=132.44s)]
*  but you mentioned the CEO of SoftBank stopping by shortly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=134.84s)]
*  to unveil $100 billion in investments in the United States. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=139.36s)]
*  They say that's going to create 100,000 jobs [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  over the next four years in AI and infrastructure [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=147.84s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=151.56s)]
*  And that will add to the to the tote. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=152.4s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if Trump put out [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  on True Social today. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=157.36s)]
*  I'm not even president yet, but I created 100,000 jobs. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=158.56s)]
*  Yeah, and this goes to show that people around the world [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  look at somebody like an Elon Musk, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  and he is very close to Donald Trump. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=167.96s)]
*  He's got Donald Trump going to his rocket launches [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=170.36s)]
*  in Texas, and he is a big supporter of Musk's businesses. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=173.56s)]
*  So there are people, there are interested parties [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=178.2s)]
*  all around the world who wanna get in there early. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=181.04s)]
*  If you can be in on the ground level with Donald Trump, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=185.0s)]
*  that is what these guys are trying to do [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=187.76s)]
*  before January 20th. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=191.96s)]
*  All right, Peter, thank you very much. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=192.8s)]
*  We actually got in on the ground level of Donald Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=193.88s)]
*  He used to be on the show long before. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=195.96s)]
*  Every Monday, he would call in to talk about [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=198.32s)]
*  the news of the day, and now he is the news of the day. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=200.72s)]
*  A lot of people wanting jobs within the administration, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=203.84s)]
*  a lot of people going to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=206.88s)]
*  I was just passing Mar-a-Lago yesterday, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  and you can see the cars. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=210.72s)]
*  They have to go through inspections. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=212.16s)]
*  Were you driving slowly? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  We were driving very slowly over that bridge [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  right when Mar-a-Lago's on your left, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=217.8s)]
*  and they stop traffic when someone's going into Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=219.24s)]
*  The parking lot was packed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=222.0s)]
*  I don't know if those are just people that are club members [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  or if those are people there to kiss the ring [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=226.08s)]
*  and ask for a job. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=228.4s)]
*  It's reflective also within the country as well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=229.8s)]
*  There's great excitement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=233.84s)]
*  It's crowded in the country. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  It's crowded at these games, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=236.52s)]
*  and Donald Trump was greeted by a ruckus crowd. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=238.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  It's clear they are happy to have the commander-in-chief [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  there to support them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=248.08s)]
*  Not only was the commander-in-chief there [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  or the future commander-in-chief, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=251.24s)]
*  former commander-in-chief. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  You've got JD Vance, Tulsi Galbraith. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  You had Pete Hegset, Daniel Penny. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=256.68s)]
*  There's Dave McCormick and his wife, Dina. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's just so shocking to me because, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  there are people in both political parties [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=264.91999999999996s)]
*  that have served in the military, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  but it looks like Donald Trump is the only one [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  that is willing to go to really a nonpartisan game. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=271.56s)]
*  The Democrats have just given it to him. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=275.44s)]
*  And another cultural moment, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=277.36s)]
*  whether it was the McDonald's, the garbage truck, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=279.12s)]
*  or going to the barbershop to this game, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump appears and he's the only one to show up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=286.24s)]
*  And it got a very great reception. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=289.84s)]
*  And, you know, in the history of this game, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=293.44s)]
*  in the history of that stadium, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=296.4s)]
*  I wonder if there has ever been such a collection [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=298.2s)]
*  of powerful people. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=300.84s)]
*  You know, you've got the Senate Majority Leader, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=302.32s)]
*  John Thune, screen left. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=304.28s)]
*  You've got the House Speaker. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=305.56s)]
*  You've got the President of the United States, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  the Vice President. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=308.32s)]
*  You've got Elon Musk. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=309.24s)]
*  You've got all those people in one spot. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=310.36s)]
*  And they're all talking about two things. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=313.12s)]
*  One, the game. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=314.96s)]
*  And everybody always has a favorite. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=316.4s)]
*  By the way, the Navy won. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=318.52s)]
*  And two, they're all talking about the future of America [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhGBcBYIo_o&t=320.15999999999997s)]
