# 'NO MORAL COMPASS': Kamala Harris is focused on power, control, says Leo Terrell
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0)
*  Well today, Kamala Harris heading back to her old stomping grounds for a fundraiser with Nancy Pelosi, fellow Lib. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=0.0s)]
*  And while earlier we highlighted her controversial record on crime, it certainly did not end there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=6.84s)]
*  As Senator, she voiced support for the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which if you'll recall, she applauded the L.A. Mayor's decision to slash police funding. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  And she also sponsored the Green New Deal and called to reevaluate through some, you know, whistles there, the role of ICE. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=21.68s)]
*  While backing health care for illegal immigrants on the taxpayers dime. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=30.24s)]
*  That's just the start of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=34.28s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former Democrat Leo Terrell lives in California and he joins us now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=35.96s)]
*  Leo, friend of the show. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=40.2s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=41.32s)]
*  We're taking care of Rachel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Don't worry here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=43.4s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=44.2s)]
*  You got it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=46.84s)]
*  Orders are taken. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  They're followed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=48.68s)]
*  Talk to me about you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=50.44s)]
*  You spent your whole life in California, lived in San Francisco. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=51.72s)]
*  You were there when she was the D.A. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=54.68s)]
*  What was what was life like when Kamala Harris was in charge of what law and order is supposed to look like? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=56.28s)]
*  Let me thanks for that question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  Let me tell you right now, Pete, Kamala Harris is the founding member of the Progressive Prosecutors of America. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=64.36s)]
*  When she was the district attorney, she allowed the cop killer to escape the death penalty. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=72.12s)]
*  She doesn't enforce the death penalty on a murder. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=79.0s)]
*  More importantly, guess what? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  She endorses George Cascon. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=83.88s)]
*  You know what George Cascon has done to Los Angeles County as a D.A. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=85.52s)]
*  She endorsed him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  She also had him as a chief of police when she was a D.A. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=90.72s)]
*  I mean, think about Prop 47. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  Prop 47 is that horrible bill that allowed people to rob and steal every day. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=97.64s)]
*  She wrote the language for the bill. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  She called it safe neighborhood and safe school. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  There is nothing safe about Prop 47 when you're allowed to steal nine hundred and fifty dollars. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=107.12s)]
*  She supports sanctuary cities. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=112.08s)]
*  And as you correctly stated, there's tape on her regarding defunding the police where she's praising the mayor. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  She has no moral compass. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=121.56s)]
*  She is focused on power and control. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=123.56s)]
*  She's a progressive. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=126.2s)]
*  She's liberal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And that is why California is in the shape it is in as far as law and order. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=128.2s)]
*  There is no law and order, Pete, in California. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=133.36s)]
*  I want to be honest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=135.52s)]
*  I lived here all my life. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=136.24s)]
*  I'm a lawyer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=137.28s)]
*  I looked at what she has done to this state. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=138.0s)]
*  She destroyed it and she destroyed it early. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=139.68s)]
*  So she was one one of the key people that was a part of the slide of of California, which beautiful state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Everyone wanted to be there for the longest time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=149.84s)]
*  Interesting. Now, she wants to turn our entire country into that kind of landscape. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  And you saw it firsthand. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=156.36s)]
*  We also talked to a police officer who's on the streets during her time as D.A. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=157.24s)]
*  in San Francisco, who said, that's the moment that everything started to slide because we started to let all the little stuff go. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=159.96s)]
*  But it, Leo, it seems that some in San Francisco have at least are applying some common sense. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  These days, we know Chesa Boudin, the D.A. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=171.8s)]
*  there was was recalled. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  There's an interim D.A. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=175.52s)]
*  Brooke Jenkins is her name. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=177.56s)]
*  She's appearing to actually crack down. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=179.4s)]
*  You have to let me know if this is real or not, because there was a protest on a bridge, the famous bridge, Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  A bunch of people were arrested, but now she's actually charging them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=187.84s)]
*  Is it a new day in San Francisco for law and order? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=191.8s)]
*  Is there a new day in San Francisco in law and order? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=196.12s)]
*  No, Pete, no. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=198.24s)]
*  I was on Fox News on I was I was on Fox News with John Roberts and Sandra Smith when this happened, where people were denied medical care because these [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=200.16s)]
*  anti-Semitic individuals blocked the Golden Bridge freeway. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  And let me tell you what happened. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=215.28s)]
*  She's filing charges. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  What does that mean, Pete? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  People get charged and then they get released. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=219.0s)]
*  Twenty six of them are getting misdemeanor. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you what that means. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=223.2s)]
*  Expungement. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=224.2s)]
*  And what is happening is this is nothing more than a political stunt. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=225.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=228.6s)]
*  I think the Jewish American community has used its political muscle. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=229.32s)]
*  See, Cory Bush, see Jamal Bowman and the people in San Francisco are running scared. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=232.6s)]
*  Just filing charges are meaningless, Pete. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=238.48s)]
*  Over the last year and a half, the Jewish community has been under attack. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=241.72s)]
*  Where's the federal government? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=245.2s)]
*  Where are the federal charges? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=246.32s)]
*  What charges are being filed? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=247.68s)]
*  So if you don't see imprisonment and convictions, this is nothing more than a political PR stunt. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=249.2s)]
*  Because when you get arrested in California, you get arrested and you get released. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=256.32s)]
*  That's it. That's what I need to hear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=261.48s)]
*  I was surprising that maybe they were turning a corner. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=262.64s)]
*  Of course, they're not, unfortunately. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=264.76s)]
*  Leo Terrell, it's great to see you, buddy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=267.36s)]
*  Always bring a smile to our face. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=269.24s)]
*  Be nice. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=270.6s)]
*  Be nice to Rachel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=271.08s)]
*  100 percent. Only if she's nice to me. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  She usually is. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=273.92s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=275.04s)]
*  Thanks, Leo. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENW2d-mbYB0&t=275.8s)]
