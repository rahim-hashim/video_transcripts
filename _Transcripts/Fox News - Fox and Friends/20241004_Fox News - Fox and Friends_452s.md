*  I know, I know. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=112.0s)]

*  I know this is such an important part of America to you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=116.0s)]
*  I have been here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=118.0s)]
*  I know this restaurant. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=120.0s)]
*  I was here with the great one, Mark Levin. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=122.0s)]
*  By the way, Mark Levin says hi to everybody. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=124.0s)]
*  Mark Levin says hi! [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=126.0s)]

*  Hi, back in LJ, Brian and Ainsley. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=136.0s)]
*  Hi, guys. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=138.0s)]
*  It's a busy day, and it's great to have you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=140.0s)]
*  Because we're about 30-some days before the election, looking down the road, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=142.0s)]
*  Donald Trump actually cut the video for Harry from his campaign plane yesterday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=144.0s)]
*  The Democrats are pulling out all the stops. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=146.0s)]
*  Now they've got, in addition to the fact that there's very little mainstream media interviews [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=148.0s)]
*  and stuff like that, they've got one of the best... [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=150.0s)]
*  She doesn't talk to the media. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=152.0s)]
*  Because if she does, nobody would ever vote for her. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=154.0s)]
*  She's a very good person. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=156.0s)]
*  She's a very good person. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=158.0s)]
*  She's a very good person. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=160.0s)]
*  She's a very good person. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=162.0s)]
*  She's a very good person. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=164.0s)]
*  She's a very good person. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=166.0s)]
*  She's a very good person. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=168.0s)]
*  If she does, nobody would ever vote for her. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=170.0s)]
*  So they're hiding her. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=172.0s)]
*  It's a national disgrace. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=174.0s)]
*  Well, what she's got going for her right now [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=176.0s)]
*  is she's got one of the most popular surrogates in the world, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=178.0s)]
*  and that is Barack Obama is going to be helping her out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=180.0s)]
*  Okay, good luck with that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=182.0s)]
*  You don't transfer leadership from one person to another. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=184.0s)]
*  You don't transfer leadership from one person to another. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=186.0s)]
*  You don't transfer leadership from one person to another. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=188.0s)]
*  At least Barack Obama sat, did interviews, spoke. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=190.0s)]
*  At least Barack Obama sat, did interviews, spoke. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=192.0s)]
*  Here we are, 33 days out of an election. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=194.0s)]
*  Here we are, 33 days out of an election. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=196.0s)]
*  She sponsored the New Green Deal, $93 trillion. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=198.0s)]
*  She sponsored the New Green Deal, $93 trillion. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=200.0s)]
*  End of capitalism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=202.0s)]
*  Nobody's asked her a question. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=204.0s)]
*  She sponsored government health care for all [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=206.0s)]
*  and, you know, with the elimination of private health insurance. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=208.0s)]
*  No answers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=210.0s)]
*  How do you like this for illegal immigrants? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=212.0s)]
*  Now, the FEMA money that should be going [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=214.0s)]
*  to North Carolina and Georgia [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=216.0s)]
*  and Tennessee and South Carolina [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=218.0s)]
*  and Florida, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=220.0s)]
*  okay, that money, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=222.0s)]
*  apparently, FEMA, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=224.0s)]
*  they didn't tell us until yesterday, is broke. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=226.0s)]
*  They raided the FEMA [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=228.0s)]
*  lockbox [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=230.0s)]
*  to give it to Harris Biden [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=232.0s)]
*  illegals so we can give them [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=234.0s)]

*  They don't have any money. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=250.0s)]

*  North Carolina today. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=354.0s)]
*  The folks we were talking to earlier, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=356.0s)]
*  they're concerned about his security, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=358.0s)]
*  but at the same time, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=360.0s)]
*  they think the Secret Service has got it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=362.0s)]
*  I mentioned earlier, when [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=364.0s)]
*  I flew into Palm Beach Airport yesterday, and I [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=366.0s)]
*  didn't describe the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=368.0s)]
*  security feature that is different, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=370.0s)]
*  they've amped it up for him, which is [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=372.0s)]
*  important. You know, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=374.0s)]
*  all I could say is, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=376.0s)]
*  how we got to a point [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=378.0s)]
*  where they claimed it was a slope [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=380.0s)]
*  roof in Butler. I used to be a roofer, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=382.0s)]
*  Steve, you know, fell nearly three [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=384.0s)]
*  stories off a roof, busted up my arm, my [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=386.0s)]
*  face, so I know what a slope [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=388.0s)]
*  roof is. That was not a slope [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=390.0s)]
*  roof. They lied. Then they said [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=392.0s)]
*  they have this area around four holes [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=394.0s)]
*  on Trump International, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=396.0s)]
*  and they have a known area where paparazzi [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=398.0s)]
*  hide out to get pictures and videos of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=400.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. They never swept [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=402.0s)]
*  the area. A guy [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=404.0s)]
*  with an AK-47 and a scope [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=406.0s)]
*  got within 300 yards, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=408.0s)]
*  130 yards in Butler. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=410.0s)]
*  And I gotta tell you something, this [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=412.0s)]
*  can't happen in our country. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=414.0s)]
*  And now we know we have Iranian assassination [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=416.0s)]
*  squads. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=418.0s)]

*  with Sean? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=436.0s)]
*  No, I don't. More Fox and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLj8jATaK0&t=438.0s)]
