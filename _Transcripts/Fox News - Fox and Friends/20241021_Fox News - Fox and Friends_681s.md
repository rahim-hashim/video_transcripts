# Peter Doocy: This could be an October surprise
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40)
*  Only 15 days to go until the election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump and Karras campaigns are heading into overdrive. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=4.2s)]
*  So President Trump talking to voters while serving them up [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=7.4s)]
*  during an iconic appearance at a Pennsylvania McDonald's. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  And Harris will focus on voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=15.3s)]
*  and Wisconsin after campaigning with celebrities this weekend. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey is live in Royal Oak, Michigan [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=22.2s)]
*  with the latest. Hey, Peter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=26.3s)]
*  Good morning. The Harris campaign seems to think they can win over [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=29.2s)]
*  persuadable battleground state voters by having moderated conversations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=32.9s)]
*  hosted by Liz Cheney. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=38.1s)]
*  That's going to happen today in Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=40.5s)]
*  And that's going to be a totally different vibe than over the weekend [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=44.7s)]
*  when the campaign had headline performances by Lizzo and Usher. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=48.4s)]
*  We got work to do, Atlanta. A.T.L. we got work to do to get this campaign [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=54.6s)]
*  across the finish line. I'm counting on you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=61.0s)]
*  We can make a difference in this election, Georgia. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=64.3s)]
*  So if you ask me if America is ready for its first woman president, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=67.6s)]
*  I only got one thing to say. It's about damn time! [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=71.9s)]
*  It's about damn time! [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=77.5s)]
*  Last night in PA, former President Trump went to watch the Jets lose [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=82.3s)]
*  to the Pittsburgh Steelers and there were apparently, you'll hear here, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=86.8s)]
*  plenty of Trump fans in the stadium. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=90.6s)]
*  Trump's biggest event yesterday, though, was not at a stadium. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=105.8s)]
*  It was at a drive-thru. A Trump supporting McDonald's franchise owner [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=109.5s)]
*  worked with the Secret Service to pass bags of fast food through the window [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=114.4s)]
*  into people's cars and they taught him how to work the fry cooker. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=118.3s)]
*  And we're going to take from these ones first. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=123.8s)]
*  It is first in for a fast food, the precious ones. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=125.2s)]
*  There's up. Keep it tight. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=128.1s)]
*  You got the salt on her. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=132.7s)]
*  Never touches the human hand. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  Very good. Very good. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  This guy's a good instructor. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=140.7s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=142.1s)]
*  I'm going to give a really big one so that it's pouring out of there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=143.7s)]
*  How good is that? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  And it's really something to think that people in Pennsylvania were eating [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  french fries that were made by Donald Trump. At one point while he was there, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  he said he'd been working at McDonald's for 15 minutes, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=161.5s)]
*  which he says is 15 minutes longer than Harris ever did. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=164.1s)]
*  He continues to say that she is making it up that she worked there in California [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  in 1983. There's just no record of her being there or not being there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, so Peter, is there is there somebody that worked with her? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=178.0s)]
*  Is there is there a manager? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=183.4s)]
*  Anybody like the carpool with anyone? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=185.9s)]
*  Did anyone say I worked with the Kamala Harris? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  Maybe that's the October surprise. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=194.9s)]
*  But the easy and only answer to your question is no. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=196.8s)]
*  She says and they had been saying before she became the top of the ticket that in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=201.4s)]
*  1983 in Alameda, California, as a royal, the Royal Oak Express gets ready to go by [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=205.5s)]
*  here outside Detroit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=212.5s)]
*  She has been saying as a minor detail in her biography that she worked at the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=215.1s)]
*  cash register and the fry machine and the ice cream machine, which fact-checked [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=222.0s)]
*  that because the ice cream machine is very rarely ever working. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=226.1s)]
*  Maybe it was in 1983, but they say that she worked there in Alameda and it's just [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=229.3s)]
*  before W2's and the campaign has not been able to find a record. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=236.0s)]
*  They can't find I know various different fact-checkers have been looking at this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=240.4s)]
*  There just is no proof and to our knowledge, there is no photo of her in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=245.6s)]
*  McDonald's apron, which now there is a photo of Donald Trump in the McDonald's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=250.5s)]
*  apron. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=255.5s)]
*  There is. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=255.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=257.6s)]
*  As he was putting on the apron, Peter. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=258.1s)]
*  And I just want to point out all that noise just now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=260.1s)]
*  No train. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=262.9s)]
*  No train. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=263.9s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=264.6s)]
*  There was no train. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=265.8s)]
*  Well, you did well. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=266.6s)]
*  Great job. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=268.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, after thank you so much here after you put on the apron. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=268.5s)]
*  They said, what do you like? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=272.6s)]
*  What's your favorite food at McDonald's? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=273.5s)]
*  I like it all. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=275.3s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=276.1s)]
*  He really does. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=277.2s)]
*  And if you look at any of the photos on Trump Force One, they're always serving [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=278.0s)]
*  McDonald's and this just this is just a dumb decision by Kamala Harris. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=282.2s)]
*  First of all, the New York Times did an entire investigation. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=286.8s)]
*  The New York Times investigative unit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  They went to the store and McDonald's is known for keeping really good records. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  So they talk with people that were there in that period of time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=298.3s)]
*  They talk with friends. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=299.2s)]
*  Apparently she started she didn't mention this back in 2019 when she was [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=300.4s)]
*  running for president. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=304.9s)]
*  But apparently when she got the nomination, she started talking about it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=305.7s)]
*  and no one has been able to verify this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=309.3s)]
*  But if this was a true story, she should have did it before him. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=311.8s)]
*  Now you got the rich guy serving at McDonald's and it just makes her look bad. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=315.7s)]
*  Well, it's just it's her biography. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=320.3s)]
*  No one really cares how many hours you work to McDonald's, but don't go tell [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=322.0s)]
*  everyone right you can relate to them because you work to McDonald's when you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=325.4s)]
*  didn't take time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=328.7s)]
*  Walls like look. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=329.7s)]
*  Yeah, like Tim Walls. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=330.5s)]
*  Can he shoot a gun? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=331.7s)]
*  Just make up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=332.7s)]
*  He's a knucklehead. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=333.3s)]
*  Sometimes is she going to say, well, I'm a knucklehead right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=334.2s)]
*  Sometimes like can she borrow that from Tim? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=337.3s)]
*  Can a woman say you're a knucklehead or is that like a dozen sound? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=340.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound like something I don't think she'll ever say that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=343.4s)]
*  I don't think she'll ever talk about this or admit if she did not work at the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=346.3s)]
*  McDonald's and sooner or later sooner or later until it was time to work. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=353.2s)]
*  I loved it when he's like never touches a human. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=354.2s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=357.0s)]
*  Never touches a human. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=358.4s)]
*  He's telling the family at the drive-through that they're there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=359.4s)]
*  What did he what was the word he used? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=363.6s)]
*  We played it in the open. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=365.1s)]
*  He said something like I'm just a nobody. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=366.1s)]
*  Oh, you're not in just a no. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, here's the sound right here. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=370.0s)]
*  This is fun. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=372.1s)]
*  I could do this all day. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=372.6s)]
*  I wouldn't mind this job. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=373.5s)]
*  I like this shop. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  I think I might come back and do it again. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  I think you look at that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=377.8s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  How are you? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=381.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=382.1s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=382.6s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=383.3s)]
*  Hi darling. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=384.1s)]
*  How are you? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  You made it possible for ordinary people like us to meet. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=385.6s)]

*  I can see. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=391.90000000000003s)]

*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  How sweet we pray for you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=398.8s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=400.0s)]
*  What a moment, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=401.1s)]
*  So, okay, the drive-through window. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=402.5s)]
*  Well, he look like he adapted to you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=404.8s)]
*  This is why. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=406.0s)]
*  Like sales. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=406.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=407.5s)]
*  Number two, he likes to stay busy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=408.1s)]
*  This is so when you go for McDonald's shift, you doing this fast food. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=409.5s)]
*  You work non-stop. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=412.6s)]
*  So he loves the pace. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised he picks up shifts. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=415.5s)]
*  But look at this photo right here, Brian. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=416.90000000000003s)]
*  You got the assassination attempt, which has become an iconic photo of him saying fight, fight, fight. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=419.6s)]
*  But you got a billionaire waving from a McDonald's drive-through window. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=424.70000000000005s)]
*  Having fun. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  Just add this to the list. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, do you think Elon Musk should do like park cars or something? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=432.5s)]
*  I mean, to show people that don't need to work. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=436.5s)]
*  What's the touching when he walked into the McDonald's and there's the lady who's giving him the apron. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=440.6s)]
*  There's the boy that's trying to the young man who's trying to help him. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=446.6s)]
*  It just makes him relatable. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=450.0s)]
*  It's like, oh my gosh, the president of the United States is in here in McDonald's and paying attention to us [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=451.0s)]
*  and actually, you know, coming to work and learning about our career and our jobs. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=456.3s)]
*  So, you know, he had to take a shot of Kamala Harris before he took off from it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=459.3s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=463.70000000000005s)]
*  He's worked 15 minutes more than her. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=464.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=466.20000000000005s)]
*  So a couple of things are going on. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=466.70000000000005s)]
*  Oh wait, I think we have that sound by Brian. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=468.3s)]
*  I love McDonald's. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  I love jobs. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=472.8s)]
*  I like to see good jobs. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=474.1s)]
*  And I think it's inappropriate when somebody puts down all over the place that she worked at McDonald's. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=476.0s)]
*  It was a big part of her resume that she worked at McDonald's, how tough a job it was. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=481.29999999999995s)]
*  She specifically worked at the french fries, where they make the french fries. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=486.29999999999995s)]
*  And she talked about the heat. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=490.09999999999997s)]
*  It was so tough. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  She never worked at McDonald's. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=493.2s)]
*  McDonald's just confirmed that again, by the way. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  She never worked at McDonald's. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=497.0s)]
*  In other words, she's lying Kamala. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, you actually have worked at McDonald's. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=503.2s)]
*  Now I have worked at McDonald's. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=506.0s)]
*  I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=507.5s)]
*  Why would she lie about that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=510.5s)]
*  Why? Because she's lying Kamala. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=512.1s)]
*  That's why I work at McDonald's. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=514.2s)]
*  It's true. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=516.5s)]
*  I mean, it's part of her biography. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=517.0s)]
*  It sounds comical. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=518.3s)]
*  But if you're going to tell people, I'm like you, I worked at McDonald's. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=520.1s)]
*  And it turns out I'm not like you and I never worked at McDonald's. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=523.9s)]
*  So instead of looking at this and saying, okay, this is a move. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=527.0s)]
*  Let's look into finding out if Kamala Harris actually did work there. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=530.3s)]
*  This is MSNBC's take. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=533.7s)]
*  What is the logic behind this going to a McDonald's? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=537.3s)]
*  I mean, we know the guy likes Big Macs and Filet-O-Fish [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=540.3s)]
*  and he's used the word love to describe the way he feels about the food there before. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=543.2s)]
*  But what's this about? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=548.1s)]
*  There's no logic to it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=551.1s)]
*  It's a stunt. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=552.3s)]
*  He has not put forth an economic agenda. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=553.8s)]
*  He, as you know, appears to be not well. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=557.0s)]
*  And he's engaged in some really bizarre types of activities during this campaign. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=561.0s)]
*  First of all, don't tell us about not well when we got Joe Biden in the White House. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=568.1s)]
*  Don't don't don't you guys have no ground to stand on after backing Joe Biden. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think this just goes to the heart of the Democratic Party right now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=577.5s)]
*  You got Kamala Harris with all the celebrities [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=580.3s)]
*  and you got Donald Trump that is with the working class people that are average day Americans [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=582.4s)]
*  and the Democrats used to be the party of the people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=588.0s)]
*  The party has completely changed. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=591.2s)]
*  How do you let the rich guy out work you on the campaign drill with the working class? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=593.4s)]
*  It's just it's just a missed opportunity for them. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=599.9s)]
*  Well, when Kamala Harris goes in a gas station and she says I love Doritos [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=602.4s)]
*  and she's shopping with her husband, the left, all the other outlets are just praising her for that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=605.9s)]
*  I thought that was wonderful. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=611.1s)]
*  But then when Donald Trump goes to work at a McDonald's to not only work there and learn about the business, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=612.7s)]
*  but also to point out that she he says she was lying about working. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=617.6999999999999s)]
*  They go crazy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=622.3s)]
*  They call it a stunt. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  They say he's not well, which is a new thing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=624.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=626.9s)]
*  So new theme is he's unhinged. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=627.5s)]
*  He's 78 not the same guy speeches are that they did their ridiculous study on the New York Times about his speeches. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=629.5999999999999s)]
*  They say they're darker. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, have you seen the candidate of joy? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=636.5s)]
*  Yeah, almost everything is negative now and people they're going at that's her strategy. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go negative. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=643.0999999999999s)]
*  If you elect him, the world's going to end and he's unhinged is not well, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=644.1s)]
*  but it's just amazing to me is it ripples down. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=648.3s)]
*  It goes from Harris to this reporter to the anchor on MSNBC one talk. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=651.0s)]
*  Jake Tapper on Saturday night president talks for an hour and a half and all they're talking about on other channels [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=656.4s)]
*  is what comedy made about Arnold Palmer and that's it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=661.8s)]
*  Well, he spoke for an hour and a half and then of course they get to January 6. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=665.7s)]
*  That's every Sunday show. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=669.6s)]
*  I'm Steve juicy. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLEpVbJm40&t=671.0s)]
