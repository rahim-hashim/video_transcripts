# 'BAD PRECEDENT': Ex-NYPD Lt. warns how Daniel Penny trial impacts police, citizens
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw)
*  Tomorrow morning, closing arguments will begin in Daniel Penny's manslaughter trial here in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=0.0s)]
*  The Marine Veterans family telling the New York Post, quote, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=5.5s)]
*  There's a lot on the line. Our brother's fate will essentially be decided. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=9.0s)]
*  Ultimately, the trust that whatever happens is God's will. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=13.0s)]
*  We will get through it together. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=17.0s)]
*  Our next guest warns this trial could set a really bad precedent for New Yorkers who might be willing to do the right thing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=19.5s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. Former NYPD Lieutenant and Army veteran and doctor Darren Porcher is here to explain. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=26.0s)]
*  Listen, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=33.0s)]
*  You know, we were talking about this. I'm looking at your POV. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=35.0s)]
*  Really, what happens as far as a verdict is one thing, but the fact he was put on trial for this, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=39.0s)]
*  that really sends a message to the rest of the city if they're in a similar situation. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=44.0s)]
*  Absolutely, Joey. This is such a bad precedent because we as common New Yorkers want to step in and help our fellow New Yorkers when they're in need. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=48.0s)]
*  This is a person that's protecting people that don't have the ability to protect themselves. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=55.0s)]
*  And I give you an example. If you and I were on this train, I would have taken the top, you would have taken the bottom, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=59.0s)]
*  and then we would have switched up when we had him on the ground. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=64.0s)]
*  Because it's important that not just police, but we as a community come together when our fellow citizens are in jeopardy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you're a former NYPD Lieutenant, so you're a police officer out there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=74.0s)]
*  You're walking the streets. Things like this happen. You guys can't be everywhere. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=78.0s)]
*  I mean, there's some bit of assurance knowing that your community wants to police itself and help each other out between when it happens and when you get there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=81.0s)]
*  What does it do for the police officers in this city to know that, hey, now citizens are just going to stand by and watch? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=88.0s)]
*  It presents a bad precedent for police knowing that the citizens are not going to step up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=93.0s)]
*  We only have 30,000 plus NYPD officers in a city of eight and a half million people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=100.0s)]
*  The NYPD can't be everywhere. So at the same token, this bad precedent that's being set by the Manhattan D.A. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=106.0s)]
*  sets real ramifications towards the NYPD officers in knowing that, hey, look, we have to do a lot more to protect citizens and we just can't be everywhere. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, tomorrow we'll be closing arguments. A verdict may come this week. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=122.0s)]
*  The jury has a lot to deliberate. Most of the witnesses that came in, it seemed like, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=127.0s)]
*  had something that the prosecution wanted to hear and had something that the defense wanted to hear. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=131.0s)]
*  You've got 12 jurors in there, New Yorkers. What do you think they're thinking sitting there? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=136.0s)]
*  Do you think any of them are putting themselves on the train with what was happening? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=141.0s)]
*  It's very difficult to speculate as to how the jurors may see things. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=146.0s)]
*  We had a defense expert that came in and stated that the cause of death for Daniel Penny was not the chokehold. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=151.0s)]
*  And then you have the prosecution that presents an amalgamation of different witnesses that present different narratives. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=159.0s)]
*  So it's really hard to see because I've seen verdicts that have gone extremely to the left, extremely to the right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=166.0s)]
*  But I'm hopeful and I'm confident that Mr. Penny will be vindicated and cleared and we can put this trial behind us. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're a veteran police officer. I'm a veteran. It'd be hard for either of us not to take action. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=179.0s)]
*  Obviously, nobody wants to see somebody die. I don't think Daniel Penny wanted to see anybody die. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=183.0s)]
*  But that's what happened. And hopefully the jury sees the innocence and the hero that he is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=188.0s)]
*  Absolutely correct. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me, Joey. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=193.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. All right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Y2HgnK5Yw&t=196.0s)]
