# CHANGE OF HEART: Schumer extends orientation invite to GOP senator-elect
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM)
*  Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office announcing Pennsylvania [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator-elect Dave McCormick is now invited to today's Senate orientation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=5.36s)]
*  Madeline Rivera has the breaking update from Washington. Maddie. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=10.14s)]
*  Hi guys, good morning. Well we wondered if something like this would happen this morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=14.24s)]
*  There is so much we're watching, not just here at the White House, but down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=18.6s)]
*  So Congress is back for the first time since before the election and one of the first orders of business [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=23.44s)]
*  for the Senate is freshman orientation for senators elect. So a huge update this morning, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=28.8s)]
*  a spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says Republican Dave McCormick [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=33.76s)]
*  and Democrat Ruben Gallego have both been invited to orientation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Neither of the two had been prior to today. The Associated Press declared Gallego the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=42.64s)]
*  winner of Arizona's Senate race this morning. The AP though had called the race for McCormick [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=47.68s)]
*  on Thursday, but Pennsylvania's Democratic incumbent Senator Bob Casey has not yet conceded. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=52.32s)]
*  Schumer's prior refusal to invite McCormick because of outstanding ballots in the Keystone [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=58.08s)]
*  State drew the ire of some Republicans who said they would stand by McCormick and would personally [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=63.28s)]
*  escort him into the Capitol today. So it appears there is no longer any need for that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=68.72s)]
*  And happening tomorrow, the secret ballot election for GOP leader. The contenders to replace Mitch [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=73.92s)]
*  McConnell include Senators John Thune, John Cornyn and Rick Scott. Many Trump supporters have thrown [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  their weight behind Scott this morning though. North Dakota Senators Kevin Kramer and John [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=85.04s)]
*  Hoeven tell Fox they'll support Thune. Kramer and Hoeven are touting their long personal relationships [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  with Thune. The winner tomorrow needs 27 of 53 GOP votes. Lawrence, Steve, Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Thanks. All right. Thank you very much. Well, it looks like he had a change of hearts and he's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  doing the right thing. Yeah. I mean, it's been called, the race has been called. There's no pathway. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=107.04s)]
*  It's time to let people get get to work. It's kind of hard to criticize the former president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=112.56s)]
*  about the transition, the powers and, you know, unity, unity, unity when they're they were blocking [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=117.28s)]
*  it. So he did the right thing. Well, and ultimately he's going to be able to sit down with people. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=122.08s)]
*  A lot of people he's never met before and he's he's winding up going to the Senate for this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=126.88s)]
*  orientation today. You know, originally Mike Lee was going to squire him around, but he's right there [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=132.32s)]
*  as this Senate leadership battle is heated. And we just saw Matt, Maddie talk a little bit about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=138.72s)]
*  a couple of Republicans who have come out in favor of Thune. So, you know, suddenly Dave McCormick is [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=144.48s)]
*  going to be one of the guys who's going to be voting. Just because the guy who lost doesn't [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=149.84s)]
*  concede doesn't mean the guy who actually won. The AP has already called it. Lots of liberal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=152.88s)]
*  outlets have already called it. Dave McCormick will be the new senator from PA. So because he won, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=156.8s)]
*  he should be allowed to go to orientation. Schumer shouldn't stop him from that. Well, you know, a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=162.4s)]
*  lot of people, number one, I did not know was important. I thought was ceremonial, but [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=166.4s)]
*  Senator Sinema yesterday said was extremely valuable. I got to get off on the right foot. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=170.32s)]
*  I got a staff and get ready. Now, Steve, you said that Chuck Schumer doesn't come on my radio show [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=173.52s)]
*  and he probably won't do it. And you said you essentially have never invited him. But that's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  my fault. And now I realize he's probably a viewer because a second ago or 15 minutes ago, I asked [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=183.52s)]
*  Bernie, Bernie Moreno, like is Chuck Schumer actually going to block Dave McCormick because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  he's in Washington? I thought, is he actually going to come there? Could we see a big confrontation? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=194.72s)]
*  Watch. You know, this is a time for the country to come together and Chuck Schumer can be that agent [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=199.84s)]
*  to bring the Democrat Party together to help us and the Republican Party get things done for the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=205.76s)]
*  American people instead of being a partisan hack. So he's got two hours left where he can show that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=211.36s)]
*  he actually cares more about the country than he cares about politics. And I'm so optimistic [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=216.4s)]
*  that he will. David McCormick will be the next senator from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=221.36s)]
*  He's here in D.C. I was with him last night. He's going to do a great job for this country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=226.0s)]
*  Well, the Democrats- They went on to say he's coming and I go, could this be like a fight? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=230.8s)]
*  Well, Democrats- You know, Chuck Schumer's thugs against the muscle of Dave McCormick. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Didn't Kamala in her concession speech, didn't she say, we're going to be the party that allows [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=238.96s)]
*  for peaceful and easy transitions? So let him go to the orientation. I'm glad Schumer had a change [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  of heart. Also, Dave McCormick will be able to vote for the Senate leadership tomorrow. That happens [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=249.36s)]
*  at 9 30. So now the balance of power in the Senate is set. The Republicans, this is great news for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  them. They got 53. They can pretty much do whatever Donald Trump passes their way once they work it out [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=261.44s)]
*  with the House. The House, however, is a little more complicated. Yeah, look right now. Right now, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=267.6s)]
*  the Republicans, Lawrence, have 214. You need 218. The Democrats have 205 at this point, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=272.64s)]
*  you can see in the middle, there are still 16, the white ones, the little dots right there, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=279.04s)]
*  there are 16 races remain. The Republicans need four. The Democrats need 13. Now here's the thing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=284.72s)]
*  When you look at the number of 214, keep in mind two of those Republicans are going to go to the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=290.88s)]
*  White House to work for Donald Trump, Elise Stefanik and Michael Waltz. So they've got to come up with [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=296.56s)]
*  a little more cushion before they can feel comfortable. It's likely that the House will win. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  Right, it is. But here's the problem. Majorities are precarious because lawmakers get sick, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=308.48s)]
*  they die, they get indicted. You can't always count on it. They suddenly retire. So if they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=314.16s)]
*  have only got a one or two vote margin, if I'm in the administration trying to get stuff through the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=322.0s)]
*  House, it's like, I don't know, what if somebody calls in sick? What if COVID sweeps through the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=328.64s)]
*  Senate? We can't pass filling the blank. They said there's some key races yet to be called [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=332.88s)]
*  in Alaska. There's a tight battle between Mary Sadler and Nick Begich, the entrepreneur, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=337.44s)]
*  we know that name, the Arizona 6th District, the California's 13th and 47th and Colorado's 8th. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=342.96s)]
*  Those are the ones that people really can't get a hold of who's going to go. But it's just going to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=349.12s)]
*  be interesting. They say the Fox Republican, Fox is told from a TAD program that the majority can [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=353.76s)]
*  lose no more than two House members to the Trump administration. Those are the two. And those two, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=359.2s)]
*  they were already gone because they have to have a quick election. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=363.92s)]
*  They're already talking about with the vacancy with Marco Rubio that it could be in the Senate, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=367.2s)]
*  a few of the representatives are up for that job as well. You seem to say [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=377.36s)]
*  Ron DeSantis will have an appointment. One of the people on the list is Byron Johnson. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  That's another seat. I mean, they have a heavy bench when it comes to the Republicans in Congress [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=384.48s)]
*  right now. Absolutely. For Florida. Another great suggestion, and I'm sure that the governor down [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=391.2s)]
*  in Florida thought about it, is Brian Mast. Right. Brian Mast is fantastic. And the key to all these [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=397.36s)]
*  faces that we've shown you is they are all in Donald Trump's lane. They, you know, in the past, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=403.6s)]
*  some of them might not have been completely on the Trump turnpike, but now they are. And so that's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=410.32s)]
*  going to make his job easier as he tries with his 100-day agenda. He's going to try to do something [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=416.08s)]
*  about the taxes, about energy, and about the border. Two words stand out from this talking [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=420.72s)]
*  point for me. Squire. Okay. And turnpike. And turnpike. Don't you think those are two great words? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=425.36s)]
*  How do you think I get to work? Like, you know, to squire him around. Well, my daughter is an [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=432.56s)]
*  Esquire. She's a lawyer. Your son is going to be an Esquire too. Five months. Five months. Just at [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=437.68s)]
*  an S in front of the Squire. I'm sorry, you were going to say something. I was just going to say [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  yesterday people in the diner were asking me, they said, is she really going to be the U.N. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=447.52s)]
*  ambassador? Because if she does, her seat's open. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, is going to fill that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=451.84s)]
*  seat, even though it's a Republican area. And I was saying maybe it's just to say thank you for [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=455.2s)]
*  all your support, but I can't imagine that she would take that and leave her seat empty. But it [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=459.52s)]
*  turns out she is. Good for her. Proud of her. She's a hard worker. Smart as heck. Went to Harvard. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=465.36s)]
*  And I really support her. But what happens with her seat? Plus 10. Plus 10. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=471.44s)]
*  There's still going to be a special election. There will be. In 90 days. So there'll be a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  Republican running against a Democrat. Correct. Okay. But it seems safe. Yeah. Because. Because. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=479.76s)]
*  It's a Republican area. Elise Stefanik won 63% of the vote. Correct. Just last week. Got it. Okay. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=485.76s)]
*  Then that works out. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And click here [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-on7FelqJM&t=491.36s)]
