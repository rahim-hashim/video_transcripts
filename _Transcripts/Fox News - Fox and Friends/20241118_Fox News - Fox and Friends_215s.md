# Corey Lewandowski: Democrats refuse to admit this about Trump's return to DC
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4)
*  Democrats gearing up for a battle over some Trump cabinet picks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=0.0s)]
*  Is this the very best that America has to offer? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Hopefully we'll see the Senate Republicans do their job, scrutinize these picks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=9.36s)]
*  The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=14.88s)]
*  will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=21.76s)]
*  Historian Congressman Jim Himes, yes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Here to react is Trump 2024 senior official and Trump 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=32.08s)]
*  Corey, let's just focus on the three they mentioned. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=37.76s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. and Matt Gaetz. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=41.12s)]
*  Out of the three, who's going to be hardest to confirm? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=44.64s)]
*  Look, my guess, Brian, is that former Congressman Gaetz is probably the most difficult. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=49.36s)]
*  We've seen the most backlash from him. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  The reason is the Democrats are anxious to get a release of a report, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=56.48s)]
*  which the House Ethics Committee was allegedly about to release, that has been put on hold. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=60.56s)]
*  That said, Brian, no one knows what's in that report. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=65.28s)]
*  More importantly, what these Democrats refuse to admit is that Donald Trump is coming back [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=67.84s)]
*  to Washington, D.C. with a mandate from the American people and is entitled to have his [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=72.32s)]
*  cabinet around him that he chooses. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=77.28s)]
*  Now listen, the U.S. Senate has the right to confirm these people, but I want to remind [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=79.28s)]
*  everybody that Donald Trump's mandate also allowed him to make the U.S. Senate a Republican [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=84.56s)]
*  majority with his winning in Pennsylvania, his winning in Ohio, bringing those candidates [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  across the line also in Montana. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=95.2s)]
*  So as these U.S. senators consider the president's nominees, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=97.68s)]
*  they should remember why they're in the majority. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=101.76s)]
*  All right, absolutely, too. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Hey, look, it's a nomination process. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=105.6s)]
*  RFK's got to have answers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=107.76s)]
*  Matt Gaetz has got to have answers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=109.04s)]
*  And let's make it pay-per-view because it's going to be electric. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=110.8s)]
*  Let's talk about Treasury Secretary. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=114.96s)]
*  A little bit surprising here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=116.56s)]
*  You know, not the sexiest position, but a vital one. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=118.08s)]
*  But Howard Lutnick says, I have a good idea. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=120.88s)]
*  Why don't I just name myself? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=122.64s)]
*  I recommend me by the power vested in me because he is part of the transition team in the selection [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=124.32s)]
*  process. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=129.36s)]
*  And it looked to be Scott Bessett's deal. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Now it looks like there's more people entered into it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=132.48s)]
*  Keysquare, there's Kevin Warsh of the former Fed Reserve Governor, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  and then Mark Rowe and the CEO of Apollo Global. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=140.32s)]
*  What's your sense on what's going on here? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=143.76s)]
*  You know, Brian, it reminds me a little bit when I was the chairman of the vice presidential [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=147.76s)]
*  selection committee in 2016. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=151.04s)]
*  And I went out and I interviewed all the candidates. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=152.56s)]
*  I should have maybe just come back to then candidate Trump and said, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=154.16s)]
*  Corey Lewandowski would be the best vice president. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=156.88s)]
*  But we picked, obviously, at the time, Mike Pence. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  That said, it's very difficult when you're in the position of making recommendations [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=161.92s)]
*  to also be positioning yourself for a position there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  Maybe you want to have someone who's agnostic to it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  Listen, I like Howard Lutnick. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=172.64s)]
*  I like all the players in this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's going to be the president's decision. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  But sometimes it's very difficult to be in the position of recommending someone when [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=177.6s)]
*  you're trying for that same very position. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  Yes, it's a little different. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=184.16s)]
*  Like Dick Cheney, he went through the whole process. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  He goes, I have an idea. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  Let's make it Dick Cheney. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=187.92s)]
*  So and he ends up being Donald Trump's running mate. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=189.6s)]
*  Excuse me, George Bush is running mate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=192.32s)]
*  Corey, it's an exciting time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=193.76s)]
*  I think the country's really rallying around the president-elect [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  if you watch football and if you watch the UFC. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=198.88s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us today. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxw60Yp-f4&t=201.35999999999999s)]
