# Major Trump orders blocked in new wave of federal judge rulings
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE)
*  All right, meanwhile, President Trump's agenda facing more legal setbacks as three federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=0.0s)]
*  judges block key actions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=6.28s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=8.2s)]
*  Like requiring proof of citizenships to vote. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Heaven forbid. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=11.36s)]
*  You have to show that you're here legally. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=12.36s)]
*  Next thing you know, I'll have honest elections. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=14.68s)]
*  Withholding funding from sanctuary cities, which are unconstitutional in my view, but [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  I guess not in that judge's view. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  And ordering the administration to return a second suspected migrant gang member from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=23.02s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=27.44s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us from Washington. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=28.6s)]
*  Hey, Maddie. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Hey, guys. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=32.56s)]
*  Good morning, rather. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=33.56s)]
*  Yeah, and in several of these cases, the federal judges say the president overstepped his authority [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=34.56s)]
*  when issuing some of his executive orders. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Last month, for instance, the president signed an EO overhauling the way federal elections [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=41.32s)]
*  are run. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=45.36s)]
*  Yesterday, a federal judge in D.C. blocked a portion of that EO, specifically the provisions [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=46.36s)]
*  requiring people to provide proof of citizenship before being allowed to register to vote. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=51.94s)]
*  Judge Colleen Colar-Cotelli says, our constitution entrusts Congress and the states, not the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=57.6s)]
*  president, with the authority to regulate federal elections. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=62.82s)]
*  Also yesterday, another judge in California blocked the Trump administration from stripping [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=66.86s)]
*  federal funds for sanctuary cities. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=70.84s)]
*  Judge William Oreck writes, the threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=73.54s)]
*  in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=78.66s)]
*  between the cities and counties and the communities they serve. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=84.42s)]
*  And finally, a Maryland judge is ordering the government to bring back another man who [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  was deported to El Salvador. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=92.0s)]
*  The 20-year-old Venezuelan man, identified only as Christian in court documents, came [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  to the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=98.54s)]
*  He was removed last month, violating a settlement agreement reached last year, preventing his [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  deportation while his asylum case plays out in court. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  In her order, Judge Stephanie Gallagher makes a reference to Kilmer Abrego-Garcia, whose [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  status remains in limbo. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=114.42s)]
*  Gallagher says, like Judge Paul Lizines in the Abrego-Garcia matter, this court will [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=116.74s)]
*  order defendants to facilitate Christian's return to the United States so that he can [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=120.86s)]
*  receive the process he was entitled to under the party's binding settlement agreement. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=125.44s)]
*  The Trump administration is expected to appeal some of the judge's decisions, so we expect [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=130.04s)]
*  the legal back and forth on this to continue for several weeks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=134.06s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=136.94s)]
*  Thanks, Maddie. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=137.94s)]
*  You go. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=138.94s)]
*  I mean, first, just on that decision, Sanctuary City is not surprising. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=140.66s)]
*  Same thing happened in 2017 when the president took over the first time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=144.18s)]
*  It seems unconstitutional, and they were working their way up, and I think they got distracted. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=148.42s)]
*  Now, of course, it's a Barack Obama judge. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=153.06s)]
*  It says you can't do that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=155.02s)]
*  So Sanctuary City, to me, I think that it's the only leverage you have. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=156.5s)]
*  If you're going to give these states money, the only leverage you have for them to enforce [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=161.1s)]
*  the law is to withhold those funds. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=164.18s)]
*  But a judge says you can't decide to do that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=166.54s)]
*  To being a sanctuary city for illegals seems fundamentally unconstitutional. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=168.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's just common sense. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=172.5s)]
*  You can't vote unless you're a citizen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=173.9s)]
*  I mean, how could you come to this country illegally? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=176.14s)]
*  Oh, on the other one, yeah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, on the other one, on the first one she was talking about. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  Because the House, they already passed a bill saying you have to be a citizen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=180.54s)]
*  You have to show proof of citizenship in order to vote. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=184.1s)]
*  There are also some other judges around the country that are blocking, as you all know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=187.38s)]
*  there have been so many injunctions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=191.1s)]
*  There are two federal judges, one in Maryland and one in New Hampshire, that shot down the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=192.1s)]
*  public schools order from Donald Trump for K through 12. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=197.66s)]
*  Donald Trump squashed the DEI in public schools, says I'm not going to give you federal funding [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=200.46s)]
*  for your state if you continue to do this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=204.46s)]
*  But they were sued by the ACLU, the National Education Association, Maryland chapter of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  Federation of Teachers, saying that it violates the First Amendment rights. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=210.78s)]
*  And these two judges in those two states have said they rule with the ACLU and those other [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  two groups. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=218.46s)]
*  And the higher courts have clearly ruled again and again that when it comes to immigration, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=219.46s)]
*  it is the special purview of the federal government. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=224.54s)]
*  And so when you have these states doing everything they can to undermine it, it's a real problem. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=227.1s)]
*  But when you have voters who have completely fired Democrats from every branch of government, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=231.22s)]
*  every lever of power in Washington, all they have left is to go to the courts and complain. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  And you wind up with, and a lot of these are procedural things that maybe get worked out, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=240.62s)]
*  but it is also a reminder that having Congress, some of the procedural things are good points, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  and it's a reminder that having Congress do their job and do things so that you don't [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=253.22s)]
*  have illegals voting is actually a really important thing, it turns out. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=258.78s)]
*  Well, and they're always going to find a judge that's going to side with them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=263.54s)]
*  They're going to find some Democratic judge that's leftist that was maybe appointed by [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=265.66s)]
*  the next president. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=268.78s)]
*  It's easier to find a judge than it is to get a bill passed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=269.78s)]
*  And so that's what they do. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=273.9s)]
*  And so you've got the one is the executive orders, then you've got the judge fair, and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=274.9s)]
*  that's where we're in the middle of right now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=278.94s)]
*  So they did a Fox poll and the president not happy about it, but he's happy about this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=280.58s)]
*  one. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=284.74s)]
*  When it comes to border security, 55 percent of the country says it is better since he [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=285.74s)]
*  took over, 22 percent says it's worse, which is for those people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=290.74s)]
*  When in 2023 it was 11 percent thought it was better when, of course, we had Mayorkas [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  in charge and worth 51 percent. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=300.74s)]
*  So obviously border security is an area of great improvement. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=303.78s)]
*  I think immigration, too. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=306.38s)]
*  But shockingly, 50-40, 49-50, people think that illegal immigration, Trump's only gets [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=307.7s)]
*  49 percent of the people to 50 percent, which is that to me, I mean, it will make me want [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=314.3s)]
*  to revisit that poll. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=318.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=319.68s)]
*  This is the this is the flaw of polls. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=320.68s)]
*  He does the best for border security, but he's underwater on immigration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=323.26s)]
*  So what is the and I think that disconnect? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=329.82s)]
*  You know, when you have somebody who's trying to, say, deport a an MS-13 gang member and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=331.82s)]
*  90 percent of the media accuses him of deporting a Maryland dad, what you wind up with is just [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=339.5s)]
*  sort of a negative feeling that people have. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=346.26s)]
*  And it's what Trump has been fighting against his entire political. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=348.58s)]
*  There's a congresswoman. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=352.3s)]
*  Her name is Frederica Wilson. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=353.3s)]
*  She represents Florida. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=354.7s)]
*  Great hats. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=356.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=357.18s)]
*  And she is a Democrat. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=358.18s)]
*  And she it looked I mean, so weird. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=359.88s)]
*  She had this press conference on the side of the road and like the woods behind her [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=362.24s)]
*  in a few cars. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=365.2s)]
*  But anyway, she she went live on Instagram. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=366.2s)]
*  She said she visited the Ice Crone Detention Center in Miami. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=368.92s)]
*  And so then she holds this news conference and was blaming the Lake and Riley Act for [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=372.88s)]
*  increased migrant detentions. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=376.58s)]
*  She said, I wanted to see dangerous people picked off the street and I didn't see that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=378.84s)]
*  She said, I saw hardworking men behind bars. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=382.8s)]
*  So here's a portion of that press conference yesterday that went live. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=385.78s)]
*  Because of the new Riley Act that was passed, people are going to be picked up off the street [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUjxZskLaeE&t=390.36s)]
