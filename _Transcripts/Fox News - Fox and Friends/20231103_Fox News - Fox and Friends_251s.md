# There are no ceasefires against terrorists: Danny Danon
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI)
*  Please move out, because as we have the right for self-defense, we want you to go out of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=0.0s)]
*  the premises from where missiles and guns and bombs and mortars are shelled at our people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=7.12s)]
*  How Israel does this matters, and it is very important that when it comes to the protection [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=14.08s)]
*  of civilians who are caught in a crossfire of Hamas's making, that everything be done. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=19.56s)]
*  That was moments ago. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=24.64s)]
*  Right now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting with the Israeli president after [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=25.64s)]
*  meeting with the prime minister earlier this morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=29.4s)]
*  These talks coming in just days after President Biden himself called for a so-called humanitarian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  pause to fighting in Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=37.44s)]
*  He did it at a fundraiser. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=39.56s)]
*  Former Israeli ambassador to the UN and member of the Israel's Knesset, Danny Dannen joins [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=41.44s)]
*  us now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Ambassador, do you think the prime minister will adhere to the request to pause? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Good morning, Brian. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=56.92s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=57.92s)]
*  Should we agree to a ceasefire? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  We had a ceasefire until October 7th, and then Hamas attacked us, massacred 1,500 innocent [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=61.04s)]
*  Israelis, raped our daughters and kidnapped 240 Israelis, including 30 babies. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=67.4s)]
*  So should we now stop and allow them to regroup, allow them to restock the rockets and move [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=73.84s)]
*  the hostages to different locations? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=80.3s)]
*  It will be irresponsible to accept a ceasefire. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=82.72s)]
*  We have to go after them the same way like you did with ISIS, with Al-Qaeda. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=86.36s)]
*  You never spoke about a ceasefire. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=91.52s)]
*  You spoke about elimination of evil. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=93.24s)]
*  That's what we are doing now in Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=95.52s)]
*  And I think people should understand that, and we should be brought up, but there's a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=97.96s)]
*  lot of political pressure, I guess. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=102.24s)]
*  World opinion thinks there should be a ceasefire, kids sitting in the middle of the street hoping [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  for that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=107.44s)]
*  But Hamas, when they're fighting you guys, you say in the biggest surprises, they don't [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=108.88s)]
*  fight. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=113.4s)]
*  They ambush, they sneak in, and they're trying to ambush you guys now that you're in Gaza, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  They are cowards, Brian. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  They are not fighters, they are not warriors. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  When they fought against women and children, they were very brave. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  They took pictures. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  They had a lot of videos around them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Today they are hiding like cowards in the tunnels, but we are capable to find the tunnels, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  to blow the tunnels. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=139.88s)]
*  So they're trying to ambush our forces at night, usually. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=141.2s)]
*  So we're taking our time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  We move very slowly, but we are determined to go all the way. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  We cannot stop in the middle. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=150.2s)]
*  We cannot leave Hamas in Gaza. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=151.44s)]
*  Basically, if we do that, it will bring another attack on Israel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=153.6s)]
*  So the UN, your place you used to work at, says Iran is carrying out executions at an [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  alarming rate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  They're an evil nation that foments terror around the world. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  Yet Iran was still able to chair the UN human rights forum. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=165.88s)]
*  What does that say about the body you used to work in? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=170.02s)]
*  That's so shameful to see the UN, they are not capable of condemning Hamas. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=175.38000000000002s)]
*  Even today, they are not able to speak about the humanitarian aspects of our kidnapped [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=180.3s)]
*  Israelis, the babies. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=186.58s)]
*  And they put Iran in such a position. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  I have zero expectations from the UN, and we are very disappointed also from the secretary [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  who justified the whole attacks against Israel by saying that we should look what happened [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=196.98s)]
*  in the past. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=202.26s)]
*  There is no justification to the barbaric terror attacks against Israel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  Naser Al, we're going to declare war on you guys when he goes to the microphone, probably [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  within a half hour. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=212.62s)]
*  So you know, it's a chess game. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=216.33999999999997s)]
*  You know, Iran, they're playing a chess game. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=217.73999999999998s)]
*  They're using their proxies, he's Bala, the hoodies in Yemen, Hamas, and we are ready. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  And I would advise Naser Al not to make a mistake because we will bury his Bala. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=225.32s)]
*  Lebanon will not look the same if he will try to test our might and our resilience. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=230.2s)]
*  I agree, and I believe he will. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=234.84s)]
*  Thanks so much, Ambassador Danny Dannen, for joining us this morning. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=240.12s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvRZcDfLGI&t=241.12s)]
