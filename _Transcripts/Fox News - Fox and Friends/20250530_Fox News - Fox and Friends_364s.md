# Gen. Keane: It would shock me if Putin does this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY)
*  Well, it is my understanding and it is our hope that Russia and Ukraine will engage in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=0.0s)]
*  direct talks and negotiations next week in Istanbul. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=4.62s)]
*  And we believe that meeting is going to take place. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=8.68s)]
*  And that is a meeting the president encouraged and urged for these two sides to come together [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=11.0s)]
*  and negotiate directly. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=15.08s)]
*  The White House appearing optimistic as Ukrainian officials submit to a ceasefire proposal to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  their Russian counterparts ahead of a second round of direct peace talks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=21.84s)]
*  But despite the talks, Russia has sent more than 50,000 troops to the Ukrainian northern [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=25.44s)]
*  border in recent days. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  We believe there's going to be a summer surge. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=31.5s)]
*  Here to discuss is retired four-star general Jack Keane. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=33.64s)]
*  General, your thoughts about what we can expect on Tuesday judging by the actions of the Russians [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  to this point. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'd be shocked if the Russians change their maximalist demands, which is they want [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  more territory than they occupy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  They want to demilitarize Ukrainian military. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=52.76s)]
*  They want a regime change in Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=56.46s)]
*  They want signatures by everybody involved that there be no NATO expansion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=58.96s)]
*  And the list goes on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=64.24s)]
*  All of those demands are really quite unreasonable. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  What Putin has been counting on is that he believes the United States and Ukraine want [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=69.2s)]
*  a peace agreement and a ceasefire much more than they do. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=74.88s)]
*  And I think that evidence is pretty clear now after many weeks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=79.0s)]
*  They're willing to talk, but they're not willing to negotiate anything that's realistic. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=82.08s)]
*  And that's where we stand. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=86.88s)]
*  I know your communication. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=89.56s)]
*  You're very well respected at the White House. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=91.96s)]
*  Do you believe the president is beginning to realize that, that Putin is not the guy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=93.48s)]
*  that he was and is not interested at all in peace? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  And at one point, he's going to elect Congress and their massive sanctions, work their way [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=102.84s)]
*  through with a veto-proof vote? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=107.8s)]
*  Well, I think the president so many understands that Putin has been playing this and dragging [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=112.84s)]
*  this out as long as it possibly can. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=117.8s)]
*  I think where the president is, he wants to hold on to this relationship. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=119.6s)]
*  He believes in personal diplomas. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=123.32s)]
*  He knows once he cracks down with crippling sanctions and hopefully what Putin will really [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=124.88s)]
*  pay attention to is continued military assistance to Ukraine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=130.56s)]
*  Once that happens, I think the president believes that relationship is likely significantly [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=136.32s)]
*  tarnished. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=140.8s)]
*  So he wants to see if this is going to work. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  Certainly he knows full well that Putin has been dragging this out for his own interest. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=145.28s)]
*  Where I think Putin really is, is that he wants to continue this war. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=150.72s)]
*  He's 39 months into the war and he hasn't toppled Ukraine, which he said he was going [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=154.4s)]
*  to do in a week. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  That is enormous pressure. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  That's the same amount of time the United States went into Europe and Africa and toppled [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  the Nazi regime, 39 months. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  And Putin is at this and look at it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=170.48s)]
*  He's failed and he's still failing in terms of what his objective is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=172.72s)]
*  He wants to continue this fight on his terms. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  And the reason is his presidency is at stake. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  He can't fail in front of his people, he believes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=183.5s)]
*  And a result of that, he would be significantly diminished. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  They may push for another leader and likely he could be assassinated once he came out [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=190.0s)]
*  of office. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  He knows all of that is the playbook that he's dealing with. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  And they almost blew his helicopter out of the sky over the last weekend. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=199.56s)]
*  So let's switch over to Iran. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  There's optimism that they might have a framework for talks going forward. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=204.56s)]
*  I'm not optimistic anything will ever come out of this of substance, nothing better than [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=207.68s)]
*  what Obama did. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=212.08s)]
*  But here's what the Iranian foreign minister posted. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=213.44s)]
*  Said, media is speculating about an imminent Iran-U.S. deal. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=215.8s)]
*  Not sure if we're there yet. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=219.56s)]
*  Iran is sincere about a diplomatic solution that will serve the interests on both sides. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=220.88s)]
*  But getting there requires an agreement that will fully terminate all sanctions, uphold [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=225.48s)]
*  Iran's nuclear rights, including enrichment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=229.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=232.04s)]
*  Those last two lines showed you were just spinning our wheels. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=233.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Iranians entered into a framework deal in 2013 with the Obama administration [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=236.6s)]
*  to stall these negotiations. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=244.72s)]
*  And it took two years before they finally came up with the JCPOA. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=246.84s)]
*  And the Obama administration moved completely away from dismantling the program, which is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=252.44s)]
*  what our position is today, from taking down their ballistic missiles. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=257.16s)]
*  They moved away from all of that and they permitted them to have enrichment facilities [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=260.92s)]
*  and to enrich. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=265.52s)]
*  And the Iranians want another framework deal, drag out the negotiations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=267.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=271.56s)]
*  Because they believe that will stall the Israeli attack and certainly the United States attack [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=272.56s)]
*  if they're involved in these negotiations. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=277.68s)]
*  That's their game plan here, as far as I understand, and just looking at the play of the Iranians. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=279.96s)]
*  Just like the Russians, these guys have a playbook. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=286.64s)]
*  They're predictable because they're consistent. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=289.2s)]
*  And you can counter this playbook pretty effectively. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=291.96s)]
*  The president has said unequivocally, total dismantling, anything else is unacceptable. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=295.12s)]
*  Total dismantling of the enrichment facilities themselves. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  But to guarantee that, Brian, you have to have anywhere, anytime inspections or else [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=307.76s)]
*  the Iranians will have another facility with those enrichment capabilities and do it secretly. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  They have never granted anywhere, anytime inspections. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=318.2s)]
*  That has to be on the table as a red line for us or what? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=321.48s)]
*  They will cheat. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=324.88s)]
*  We know that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=325.88s)]
*  And then they'll take their money that they're getting because there's no sanctions and they'll [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=326.88s)]
*  go Hezbollah and Hamas will get money again and the Houthi rebels. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=329.44s)]
*  That's my big worry. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=333.12s)]
*  They'll cheat their lie and they'll continue with their proxies, which keeps the Middle [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=334.36s)]
*  East in turmoil. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=338.0s)]
*  I just hope we, I hope Steve Witkoff holds to what you just said. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=339.16s)]
*  General, thanks so much. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=343.64s)]
*  Yeah, great talking to you, Brian. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=345.64s)]
*  Have a wonderful weekend, you and a team. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=350.04s)]
*  For the latest, go to the Institute of Study Award. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyjCdH3JMY&t=351.04s)]
