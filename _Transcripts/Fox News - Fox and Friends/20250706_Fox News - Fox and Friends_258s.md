# Woman swept 20 miles downriver while clinging to tree: 'IN SHOCK'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E)
*  Unbelievable video showing Texas troopers rescuing a woman desperately clinging to a tree after floodwater swept her from her campsite and center downriver for 20 miles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=0.0s)]
*  Officials got there in time thanks to the efforts of a nearby family who spotted her and made the call. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=14.5s)]
*  Those heroes join us right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=20.5s)]
*  Carl, Josh and Jude Jeter, thank you for being here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=23.0s)]
*  Carl, take us through. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=27.0s)]
*  You heard the screams. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=28.5s)]
*  You saw this woman in a tree. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=30.0s)]
*  Walk us through what you saw. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, we had not totally evacuated. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=35.5s)]
*  Our home was right on the river, but we're 25 foot in the air and floodwaters were rising. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=39.5s)]
*  I had gone about a half a block down the street where I could still watch, but was on drier land. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=46.0s)]
*  And as soon as the waters stopped rising and began to recede a little bit, I waded in, went up on my deck, and as I did, she spotted me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=52.5s)]
*  And she started to scream for help. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=66.5s)]
*  At first, I couldn't locate her. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=69.5s)]
*  I thought she was in the river itself going downstream. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=73.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh my gosh. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=76.5s)]
*  And then I finally was able to look across the river into the tree and I spotted her. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=78.5s)]
*  So I began to call out to her and tell her that I see her, you know, I got you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=85.5s)]
*  We're going to get you some help. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=92.5s)]
*  It's going to be okay. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=94.0s)]
*  Just hang on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=95.0s)]
*  And she's just 22 years old, 20 miles she hung on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=96.5s)]
*  She said that she saw refrigerators trying to take her under. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=100.5s)]
*  I can't imagine having gone through that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=104.0s)]
*  You know, Jude, what went through your mind when you saw this? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=106.5s)]
*  I was like getting scared. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=110.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=114.5s)]
*  I mean, I imagine you would be. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=115.5s)]
*  I mean, you're so young, having to see something like this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=116.5s)]
*  You know, Josh, walk us through what did the rescue look like? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=119.5s)]
*  So you make this call, you alert authorities, and then take us through the rescue efforts. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=124.5s)]
*  So there were multiple teams that showed up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=129.5s)]
*  We had a swift water rescue from Bernie, Texas, team that showed up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=133.5s)]
*  And then there were some Texas Parks and Wildlife game wardens that showed up with boats as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=137.5s)]
*  We were able to help launch those boats by hand into the water for them to get in and rescue her. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=142.5s)]
*  It was just kind of, you know, you didn't think about it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=149.5s)]
*  You just did what you needed to do to help them get into the water to save this young lady that's clinging to life in a tree. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=153.5s)]
*  You know, Carl, my understanding is you invited this woman into your home. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=160.5s)]
*  You gave her shelter. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=163.5s)]
*  What were those conversations like? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=165.5s)]
*  Well, they were interesting, to say the least. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=168.5s)]
*  I mean, she was in shock. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=171.5s)]
*  I mean, she, you know, she was cut and bruised and banged up from the truck and cold. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=173.5s)]
*  So we wrapped her in blankets and towels and got her into the house, a dry spot, because it was raining outside at the time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=184.5s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=191.5s)]
*  And we, you know, we just, she began to open up a little bit about what was going on and said that she went in the, her and her family went in the river about 4 a.m. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=194.5s)]
*  And this is eight something. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=205.5s)]
*  She said she was in the river for four hours at that point. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=207.5s)]
*  You know, Josh, sorry, go ahead. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=212.5s)]
*  No, I mean, you know, she was she was just extremely upset, concerned, worried and what have you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=215.5s)]
*  I imagine as much. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=229.5s)]
*  She was with her family, the only one rescued so far. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=231.5s)]
*  Carl, Jude and Josh, you guys are heroes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=234.5s)]
*  You saved a woman's life. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=236.5s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=238.5s)]
*  And we're praying hopefully her family can still be recovered and we're praying for her as well going through that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=240.5s)]
*  So Carl, Jude and Josh, thank you so much. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnQqc67A65E&t=245.5s)]
