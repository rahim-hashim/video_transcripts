**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0)
*  All right, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=0.0s)]

*  It really terrified me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=17.28s)]
*  Riding shotgun to a Wisconsin rally [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=18.8s)]
*  in a garbage truck, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=21.48s)]
*  sharing this message to supporters [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=22.76s)]
*  after Biden called them garbage. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  250 million Americans are not garbage. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=28.0s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=32.76s)]
*  Riding in in a garbage truck. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=36.32s)]
*  Plus, Pete Hexedad is having breakfast with friends [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=38.28s)]
*  in Battle Crown, Michigan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=40.76s)]
*  Has a big crowd there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=42.24s)]
*  Where Trump and Harris are in a dead heat. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=43.68s)]
*  Neck and neck there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=47.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=48.16s)]
*  We're gonna hear from Pete in a bit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=49.0s)]
*  And a spooky scene this Halloween. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=51.24s)]
*  As Joe Biden appears to bite four children [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=54.68s)]
*  at a White House party. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=58.56s)]
*  I mean, it's true. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=60.8s)]
*  No president like Boxing Friends right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=63.92s)]
*  And Remember Born is a better reference. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=66.56s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=68.6s)]
*  I'm just counting my fingers. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=73.24s)]
*  Election is five days away. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=75.4s)]
*  And former President Trump flips the script [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=77.28s)]
*  on Joe Biden's trash talk in every way [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=79.88s)]
*  after he called MAGA supporters garbage. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=82.52s)]
*  How do you like my garbage truck? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=86.12s)]
*  This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=88.16s)]
*  This was a brilliant PR move. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  It really was. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=95.0s)]
*  The cover of the New York Post this morning reads simply, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=95.84s)]
*  Trump takes out the trash after Biden's voter slur. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=98.4s)]
*  The former president rolling into that big rally [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=103.28s)]
*  in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he says his team convinced him [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=106.32s)]
*  to keep on that orange trash safety vest. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=109.92s)]
*  I said, no way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  I got 25,000 people standing outside. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=117.52s)]
*  I got all these people here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=120.48s)]
*  There's no way I'm wearing it on stage. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=121.8s)]
*  They said, oh, okay, sir. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=124.44s)]
*  I said, get me my jacket. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=125.84s)]
*  But if you did, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=127.6s)]
*  it actually makes you look thinner. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=129.76s)]
*  I said, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=132.4s)]
*  and they got me. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=136.2s)]
*  I said, I want to wear it on stage. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=137.04s)]
*  Hats off to whatever PR person told him that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=140.92s)]
*  because he wore that through the entire Green Bay rally [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  last night. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  And it was great because it brought home the message. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  And that is anybody who looks at any of the images [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=150.76s)]
*  from yesterday, they're going to see him [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  in that reflective safety vest. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=156.44s)]
*  And then gonna go, why is he doing that? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=158.92s)]
*  Why is he doing the garbage thing? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=161.32s)]
*  Oh yeah, because Joe Biden called his supporters garbage. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  That is very effective for the Trump team. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=166.88s)]
*  So Yashir Ali, who's quite liberal, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=169.24s)]
*  he said this for nearly 10 years later, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=172.56s)]
*  and a certain progressive still don't get [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=175.24s)]
*  what makes Donald Trump appeal into people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=177.48s)]
*  This is some of the quotes they say. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=179.4s)]
*  He's driving a garbage truck with his name on it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=180.8s)]
*  He's fake working at McDonald's. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=182.92s)]
*  His garbage truck driver, the campaign is over. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=185.8s)]
*  People love this stuff. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=187.84s)]
*  They think it's hilarious, fun, and endearing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=189.8s)]
*  You don't have to like it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  You can hate it and aggressively criticize it, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=193.84s)]
*  but you don't think these things are examples [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=196.12s)]
*  of his failure to many people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  So it's a campaign winning issue for the president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a gift. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=204.4s)]
*  He's taking every single thing that they throw at him [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=205.24s)]
*  and reversing it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=208.12s)]
*  And I think Kamala Harris looks less relatable. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, you used to have, you know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=213.32s)]
*  the Democrats were considered to be, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  to support the unions, to be the blue collar worker. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=217.32s)]
*  At least that's what Joe Biden ran on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=219.96s)]
*  But now we're seeing Donald Trump [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=222.12s)]
*  and he's working at McDonald's. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=223.68s)]
*  He's on the garbage truck. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  And when I turned on my TV and I saw this, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=228.12s)]
*  I saw the rally of him wearing this, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=230.4s)]
*  I thought, wait, first, what is he wearing? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  And then I realized, then I realized, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=234.12s)]
*  and I just started laughing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  Like, oh, you know, most people will laugh [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=237.52s)]
*  in their houses when they turn on their TV [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  or the Democrats will turn on their TV and say, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=241.24s)]
*  oh shoot, he's using this to his advantage. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=243.56s)]
*  Why did Joe Biden say that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=247.08s)]
*  Right, and that's what in the New York Times say, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=249.0s)]
*  Jim Manley, longtime Democratic strategist says, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=251.44s)]
*  I don't think these comments are gonna hurt long-term, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=254.08s)]
*  but it's incredibly frustrating to watch [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=256.2s)]
*  because the Harris campaign has to spend precious time [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=258.92s)]
*  clarifying what the president was trying to say. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=260.84s)]
*  We are past the need to be concerned [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=264.28s)]
*  about President Biden's feelings. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=266.56s)]
*  After all, he dealt her a pretty bad hand [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=268.28s)]
*  when he finally agreed to drop out with months to go. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=270.8s)]
*  If the Harris campaign feels the need to distance themselves, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=273.96s)]
*  they should feel free to do so. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=276.84s)]
*  The problem is, he did something two weeks ago, politically. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=278.96s)]
*  When he says, I wanna lock up Trump, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=282.4s)]
*  politically lock him up, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=285.04s)]
*  well that was the accusation in law fair, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=286.36s)]
*  that your Department of Justice was put on a mission [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  from you to lock him up and stop him from running. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  It backed up your fears. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=294.48s)]
*  We all think that you have very little respect [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  for the MAGA movement. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=298.24s)]
*  And then Trump would break down the acronym and says, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=300.32s)]
*  make America great again? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=302.36s)]
*  What are you trying to say? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=303.64s)]
*  He started this two years ago with his political geniuses. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm saying to myself, wait, do you understand [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=309.04s)]
*  you're putting down the movement, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  which had 74 million people vote there? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=312.68s)]
*  And this is what I think, my humble opinion is, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=315.16s)]
*  this will do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=317.64s)]
*  For those people that support Trump, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=318.76s)]
*  that might've thought I'm gonna stay home [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=320.36s)]
*  a little exhausted by the whole process, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=321.8s)]
*  now it's about you, now it's personal. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=323.48s)]
*  This will fire him up. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=325.56s)]
*  And when this election last time around [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=326.44s)]
*  was decided by 45,000 votes in six battleground states, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=328.88s)]
*  you know that he's more popular now, every thousand counts. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=332.6s)]
*  And they look at this and say, now he's talking about, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=337.76s)]
*  now Biden and the Democrats are talking about me. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=340.24s)]
*  This is the former president at that rally. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=343.48s)]
*  250 million Americans are not garbage. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=347.12s)]
*  This week, Kamala has been comparing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=359.12s)]
*  her political opponents [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=362.44s)]
*  to the most evil mass murderers in history. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=363.88s)]
*  And now speaking on a call for her campaign last night, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=367.24s)]
*  crooked Joe Biden finally said, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=371.08s)]
*  what he and Kamala really think of our supporters, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=373.56s)]
*  he called them garbage, no way. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=376.52s)]
*  No way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=381.4s)]
*  You can't lead America if you don't love Americans, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=384.76s)]
*  that's true. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=388.88s)]
*  And by the way, I wanna thank all of our incredible [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  sanitation workers all across America. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=396.68s)]
*  Because they work hard, they really do work hard. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=401.08s)]
*  And they do an incredible job [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  and they don't get the credit they deserve, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=409.2s)]
*  like our police, like our firefighters, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  like so many others. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=414.2s)]
*  The only thing that they have against [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  the former president right now, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  because when it comes to the issues, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=419.12s)]
*  he dominates on the issue. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=420.76s)]
*  The only thing they have is sometimes his comments [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=422.44s)]
*  push people away. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=425.88s)]
*  But when they make comments like this, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=427.72s)]
*  they even the play and feel on that one issue. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=430.2s)]
*  Some people say, well, maybe he's not so bad [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=433.0s)]
*  with his comments, if they're gonna demonize. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  Remember, he was already president once. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=437.48s)]
*  That means there are a lot of people in the country [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  that thought he was the best candidate. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=442.8s)]
*  He didn't win the second time, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=445.4s)]
*  but now you're inviting those people, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=447.08s)]
*  putting them right back in his arms [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  when you say comments like this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=450.52s)]
*  Well, you know, Lawrence, to the point, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=452.36s)]
*  this all started with the comics comments [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=454.56s)]
*  a couple of days ago. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=456.64s)]
*  The question is, who took advantage of it? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=458.08s)]
*  Who did it better? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=461.44s)]
*  Ultimately, Donald Trump did it better [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=462.35999999999996s)]
*  because he was able to visualize it like this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=464.32s)]
*  With Joe Biden, I know they have him holed up [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  at the White House, but somebody needs to take away [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  his Zoom password because he screwed it up [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=473.56s)]
*  for her in a public meeting. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  And so, he's not gonna be able to do that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  He's gonna have to do it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  He screwed it up for her in a profound way. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=482.84s)]
*  And when you look at the polls, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=485.48s)]
*  and we've been talking about the polls [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=486.76s)]
*  for the last couple of weeks, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=488.08s)]
*  they are so close to each other. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=489.56s)]
*  They're within the margin of error. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=491.76s)]
*  I would not be surprised, given the fact that how [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=493.4s)]
*  effectively Donald Trump and his team [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=495.92s)]
*  have been able to cash in on the garbage comment [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=498.04s)]
*  and do all that stuff we saw yesterday. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=500.6s)]
*  If Donald Trump wins, given the fact that it's so close, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=503.4s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised after the election, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=506.76s)]
*  people go, you know what? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=508.64s)]
*  You know what the October surprise was? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=510.36s)]
*  It was Joe Biden. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden screwed it up because Donald Trump [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=514.36s)]
*  is, in addition to a billionaire developer, a TV star. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=517.32s)]
*  In the final days, it's all about TV. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=521.24s)]
*  He does it better. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=523.28s)]
*  I wanna know who on Donald Trump's team [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  heard that comment and came up with this. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=527.0s)]
*  Garbage truck. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=529.04s)]
*  I was thinking maybe it's Don Jr. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=530.2s)]
*  or maybe someone else on the team. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=531.96s)]
*  Just say, dad, you need to get. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=533.28s)]
*  Jason Miller said it was him. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=534.08s)]
*  Okay, Jason Miller, you need to get a garbage truck. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=535.4s)]
*  We're gonna deck it out with Trump signs. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  No, Jason Miller said Trump came up with this. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=540.76s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=542.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if he's saying that, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  but he said Trump came up with it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  I believe it, he's a producer. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=546.24s)]
*  It's genius. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=547.56s)]
*  To your point, is that Joe Biden's not having a bad day, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  he's having a bad career. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=552.56s)]
*  He called himself a gaffe machine. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=555.48s)]
*  And we have montages. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  So it's not like, wow, he lost it at the end. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=558.12s)]
*  No, he lost it at the beginning. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=561.64s)]
*  But so that's who he was. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=562.48s)]
*  Picture him like a machine, his face on it, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  you push the button. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  He called him. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=565.92s)]
*  And there's a gaffe. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=566.76s)]
*  Keep in mind, Joe Biden is good at being marginalized [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  because when he was vice president for Barack Obama, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=572.36s)]
*  for the most part, he was kept in the basement. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=575.96s)]
*  Now they're trying to keep him in the basement [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=578.0s)]
*  so he just shuts up. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, he's president. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7j3a4Oe3q0&t=581.84s)]
