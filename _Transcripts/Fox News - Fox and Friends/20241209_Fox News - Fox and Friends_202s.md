# Trump delivers message to Americans who voted against him
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI)
*  President-elect Trump making his message clear to Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=0.0s)]
*  who didn't vote for him. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=2.96s)]
*  I'm going to treat you every bit as well as I have treated [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=5.76s)]
*  the greatest MAGA supporters. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=9.4s)]
*  There's never been anything like MAGA [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=11.48s)]
*  in the history of this country. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  These people are so dedicated to making America great again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=15.0s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=18.12s)]
*  And I'm going to treat them just the same as I treat MAGA. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=19.2s)]
*  We're going to treat everybody good. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=22.2s)]
*  We want success for our country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=23.64s)]
*  We want safety for our country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about Trump's messaging. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=26.88s)]
*  In Arkansas, Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=29.28s)]
*  served as Donald Trump's White House press secretary [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=31.12s)]
*  and joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=33.68s)]
*  So, Governor, your thoughts about that message yesterday [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=34.84s)]
*  in his first interview since winning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't think it should come as a surprise. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=43.04s)]
*  This is a person who absolutely loves our country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=45.28s)]
*  And when he was president for four years, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=48.8s)]
*  everybody was doing better under his leadership. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=51.44s)]
*  Our economy was strong. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=54.8s)]
*  Our border was secure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=56.28s)]
*  We had respect around the world. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=58.0s)]
*  And I think you're seeing that already [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=61.04s)]
*  before he even steps into the office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=63.08s)]
*  People are already treating him like the president, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=65.4s)]
*  from world leaders that we saw over the last several days, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=68.64s)]
*  to the business community, to elected officials. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=72.36s)]
*  And that's because, one, people know that their life [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=75.64s)]
*  was better under President Trump [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  than under this past administration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=79.64s)]
*  And this is a person who's going to fight [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=81.64s)]
*  for every single American and for every person [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=83.16s)]
*  to do well in this country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=85.64s)]
*  So, Governor, they always say in life, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=87.04s)]
*  you can always judge someone's character [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  by how they treat people they need nothing from. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  And then the interim, if you look at the inner cities [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=93.2s)]
*  and how they're beginning to flip [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  and they were more open to his message, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=97.4s)]
*  would this not be a great time to go to Chicago, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  go to New York, go to Philadelphia, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  go to these areas and say, what do you need, how can I help? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  And that would put pressure on maybe some Democrats [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=106.72s)]
*  in that area, especially House members, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  that they might need to get something passed? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=112.64000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=116.08s)]
*  And you saw glimpses of that from the campaign, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=116.92s)]
*  the president going into places [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=119.28s)]
*  that don't traditionally vote for Republicans. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=121.4s)]
*  And he was able to change and move those numbers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=124.48s)]
*  and bring in new demographic of voter. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=127.28s)]
*  But I think one of the big things, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  that's who Donald Trump has always been. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=131.44s)]
*  He never needed this job. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=133.16s)]
*  He never needed to be in office in the first place, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=135.16s)]
*  but our country desperately needed him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=138.36s)]
*  We needed somebody who would take on institutions [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=140.6s)]
*  that had long been allowed to have total [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=143.72s)]
*  and absolute control of our country [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  and fight back for people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=148.16s)]
*  who had not had a voice in a long time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=150.92s)]
*  That's why he had so much support [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  from so many different sectors [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  is because he finally gave a voice to people [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=157.04s)]
*  who felt like they'd been ignored for decades. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=159.64s)]
*  That's why he won overwhelmingly. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=162.28s)]
*  And I think it would be great to see him continue [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  to go into a lot of these communities, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  continue building support, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  but more important than just building support, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  show them what he's going to be able to do [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  to make their communities and as a whole, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  our country infinitely better. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  Right, and who's stopping it from happening? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  Explain it to people that you care. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  Governor Huckabee Sanders, thanks so much. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=185.84s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=187.84s)]
*  Talk to you soon, Sarah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoO9WfjiTfI&t=188.67999999999998s)]
