# Musk reveals vast inner workings of DOGE
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI)
*  So, Elon Musk is defending Doge's cost-cutting mission as the House prepares to hold two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=0.0s)]
*  more Doge-style hearings today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=7.72s)]
*  Madeleine Rivera is in Washington and she has the latest for us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=11.08s)]
*  Hey, Madeleine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=13.96s)]
*  Hi, guys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=14.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=15.96s)]
*  Yeah, speaking to Larry Kudlow, Elon Musk acknowledged the criticism Doge has been getting. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=16.96s)]
*  He called the work tough sledding, but he also maintains they are doing the right thing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=20.44s)]
*  When people criticize, say, what Doge is doing, we say, well, which part specifically? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=25.96s)]
*  Because we put all of the actions of the Doge team on the Doge.gov website and on the Doge [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=29.88s)]
*  Handle on X. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=37.0s)]
*  So, we post the receipts. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=38.0s)]
*  So, it's like this action has been taken, this action has been taken. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=39.8s)]
*  When we get criticism, we say, like, of what? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Which line do you disagree with? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Like, which cut? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=48.92s)]
*  Musk says Doge is in nearly every federal department. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=51.84s)]
*  He says there are plans to double the size of the team from 100 to 200. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=54.84s)]
*  Many says he does anticipate they could reach $1 trillion in savings, barring any obstacles [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=59.54s)]
*  to their work. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=65.16s)]
*  There are calls, though, from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that Congress should [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  be the ones making the cuts. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=70.4s)]
*  There are two hearings on Capitol Hill today looking at potential fraud and waste. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=72.22s)]
*  There's a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing to examine COVID fraud this morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Chairman Pete Sessions says we uncovered billions of taxpayer dollars rushed out the door during [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=81.06s)]
*  the Biden administration under the guise of pandemic aid. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=86.74s)]
*  We owe it to the American people to continue this investigation, identify long lasting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=90.06s)]
*  solutions and ensure their tax dollars are spent effectively. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=94.94s)]
*  The House Homeland Security Subcommittee is also holding a hearing this afternoon. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=99.24s)]
*  They say that too will be focused on identifying waste, fraud and abuse in the department during [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=103.34s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=108.06s)]
*  Lawrence, Steve, Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=109.06s)]
*  All right, Mary, thanks. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=111.06s)]
*  Thank you, Madeline. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=112.06s)]
*  Fascinating to see Larry Kudlow sit down with them in the White House yesterday. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=113.06s)]
*  For it looks like 20, 25 minutes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=116.38s)]
*  And it's hard to see a guy in the country more under fire. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=118.78s)]
*  And if you listen to that podcast, which as I mentioned yesterday, it takes three, three [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=121.86s)]
*  and a half hours to get through, there's constant threats on his life. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=125.3s)]
*  And he says, I'm worried that somebody is going to be hearing these descriptions of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=129.1s)]
*  me as a Nazi that can't be stopped and a communist. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=132.06s)]
*  And they're going to say it's my duty to go have him eliminated. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=135.54s)]
*  And what he's doing is with his free time, allowing his companies to let his vice presidents [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=138.74s)]
*  run those companies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  And he's focusing for free and forming a force to lean out government and get out the corruption [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  in government. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=152.98s)]
*  And there's so much pushback. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=153.98s)]
*  I don't, my view is he can't get his head around it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  He posted on Doge.gov. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  Take a look at it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=161.82s)]
*  Point out the contracts yesterday, for example, Lee Zeldin posted on his, he's going to eliminate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=162.82s)]
*  three point two million dollars in programs that he found. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=168.62s)]
*  And then you have Marco Rubio says USAID, I've decided to eliminate 83 percent of the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=171.74s)]
*  programs there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=176.58s)]
*  That's in conjunction with Doge. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=177.58s)]
*  And it also talks about the weekly credit cards. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=178.58s)]
*  We were, we were looking at this while Madeline was talking, we were listening to her on Doge.gov [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=180.74s)]
*  and it says 200,000 credit cards have been deactivated among 16 different agencies that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=186.18s)]
*  were audited. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=192.38s)]
*  These were credit cards that were unneeded. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=193.38s)]
*  So you can go on there and you can see the report card of all the ways. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=194.94s)]
*  And the next step apparently is Doge plans to, and actually the state of Ohio does, every [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=198.9s)]
*  check that the government cuts, they plan on posting on the Doge site. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=204.14s)]
*  But y'all talk about the threats. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  I honestly didn't realize it was this bad. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  Hannity did a full deep dive into this yesterday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  The amount of car dealership that had been set on fire as a result of this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=215.22s)]
*  I mean, this is, this is crazy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=218.62s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=220.54s)]
*  Cyber trucks that were brought up. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=221.54s)]
*  Cyber trucks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=222.54s)]
*  Donald Trump said he's going to buy a Tesla. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=223.54s)]
*  Sean yesterday on radio said he's buying one and he's going to donate it to a winner. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=224.78s)]
*  He also said he's going to buy another one last night. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=229.74s)]
*  Well, and it's not just in this country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=232.7s)]
*  It's also a cyber attack on X. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=234.66s)]
*  Elon Musk, during that interview at one point, he said that there were disruptions, denial [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=237.78s)]
*  of services in a gigantic orchestrated way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=244.7s)]
*  He said it looked like either a really large organization or a country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=248.5s)]
*  And he suggested that it looks like it's coming from the Ukraine area. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=253.22s)]
*  You got to figure if, if he's going to say that, it probably does look like it's coming [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=258.62s)]
*  from the Ukraine area. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=262.82s)]
*  However, that's how Russia does stuff. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=264.7s)]
*  They spoof things to make it looks like, like it's coming over there from over there because [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=266.82s)]
*  they would love to have Elon Musk pull the plug on the Starlink internet stuff that has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=271.14s)]
*  been so effective in helping Zelensky. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=277.02s)]
*  Everybody knows that's probably what Russia is doing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=280.5s)]
*  You can't think that anybody in Ukraine would be screwing with X at this point. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=282.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=287.58s)]
*  Short over the weekend, Starlink's not moving. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  They're going to keep it up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  That's going to be devastating. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  In Ukraine? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, in Ukraine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  But I don't do what I did. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  So yesterday I got an X alert that had been compromised. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=296.7s)]
*  So it looked legitimate. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  By the Russians? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, it just said, just said, yeah, we have a problem. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, your X account. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=304.94s)]
*  So I clicked through and I'm dead. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=306.52s)]
*  So I can't get on my X account. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=309.94s)]
*  Where was this warning? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=311.9s)]
*  Was it an email or was it on your X account? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=313.0s)]
*  It was an email. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=314.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=315.9s)]
*  I looked totally authentic. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  I clicked on it and then it said to report the problem, click on it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=318.73999999999995s)]
*  And it's from Turkey. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=322.78s)]
*  You fell for it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=323.78s)]
*  I, absolutely. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=324.78s)]
*  You're not supposed to do that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=325.78s)]
*  I'm guilty as charged. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=326.78s)]
*  We all accidentally got it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=327.78s)]
*  I just thought, I just thought I must have, because I post a lot of things over the weekend. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=328.78s)]
*  I'm trying to think, for the life of me, I didn't know X was down. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=332.34s)]
*  I said, what did I do wrong? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  So I'm looking at my postings. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=337.06s)]
*  So let me make sure. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  They said if you don't get back to me in 24 hours, your account will be stopped. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  So I didn't want that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  That happened to me before. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  That's why I got my whole account right now is that I clicked on it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=346.1s)]
*  Kids don't try that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  That's why I'm bringing it up. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=349.98s)]
*  That's exactly what it looked like. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=350.98s)]
*  So are you going to be able to fix it? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=351.98s)]
*  It's up to our chief of staff. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=353.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=355.14000000000004s)]
*  Lexi always gets to the bottom of it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=356.14000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=357.74s)]
*  Our assistant's new title is chief of staff. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=358.74s)]
*  Yeah, because she's not an assistant. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  It sounds better too. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=361.86s)]
*  She does everything. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=362.86s)]
*  You know, all this pushback in the media, I don't get it because they've been quite transparent [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=364.1s)]
*  of what they want to do in Doge, what they're doing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=369.5s)]
*  the website telling you exactly you can find this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=373.54s)]
*  There's no secrets here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  Elon went even deeper yesterday with Cutlow talking about the inner workings of Doge. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=382.62s)]
*  How do you pick your next targeted agency or department? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=383.62s)]
*  Well, we're we're trying to act broadly across all departments. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=389.1s)]
*  So it's not just one department at a time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  Are you in all of them now? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=401.78s)]
*  All of them? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=403.06s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=404.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=405.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=406.06s)]
*  Oh, we're trying to make the government more efficient across the board. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=407.06s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=411.9s)]
*  How big is your team? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=412.9s)]
*  We're a little over 100 at this point. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=413.9s)]
*  Get to 200. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=417.02s)]
*  You're going to get to 200. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=418.02s)]
*  We've got this enormous federal budget deficit and it's a two trillion dollar deficit. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  It keeps growing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=425.78s)]
*  Our interest payments are higher than our Defense Department budget. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  That's I think was the real wake up call for me was looking at seeing that the interest [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=433.98s)]
*  payments to national debt exceeded the Defense Department budget. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=439.46000000000004s)]
*  And that was only growing over time, which meant if we didn't do something about this, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=444.26s)]
*  then there won't be any money for anything. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=449.1s)]
*  We'll just be servicing debt. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=452.5s)]
*  So Donald Trump doubled and tripled down on his support of him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=454.3s)]
*  Steve, yesterday we were just talking about what was happening behind closed doors. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=458.06s)]
*  I think it was on Friday. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=461.09999999999997s)]
*  It was a real fight. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=462.09999999999997s)]
*  The cabinet secretary stood up and said, I need control of my personnel. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=463.9s)]
*  There's some of the guys at your work or some of your Doge people were cutting some people [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=467.26s)]
*  that we need and between Sean Duffy and Marco Rubio, but they aired it out. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=471.34s)]
*  Now think about this. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=475.06s)]
*  In any sport, the Kansas City Chiefs, your New York Yankees, whatever it is, whatever [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=476.06s)]
*  company you're in, if you really want to be successful, tempers will flare. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  I love it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=484.1s)]
*  Confident people will go at each other and it makes you better. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=485.1s)]
*  If you're just going on to hold onto your job, that's when there's almost no friction. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=488.41999999999996s)]
*  There's also a lot less incentives for the most part for success. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=492.97999999999996s)]
*  If your goal is to make the country better, because you don't leave, for example, Sean [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=496.9s)]
*  Duffy's job where he's making great money working every board in both channels with [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=501.14s)]
*  nine kids in New Jersey, you don't leave that job to make $200,000 and live away from [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=506.05999999999995s)]
*  your family for four years unless you love the country. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=512.26s)]
*  You had coach. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=514.86s)]
*  Right, but that's just it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=515.86s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with having it out. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=517.98s)]
*  You got two players that are superstars in their own rights in different areas and then [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=520.38s)]
*  you have the President of the United States, which I'm told in the meeting that made the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=524.86s)]
*  final call to say, okay, this is the right. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=527.66s)]
*  He let them fight it out. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=529.66s)]
*  He let them fight it out and said, this is the move that we're going to make now. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=530.66s)]
*  Two things that I learned from that interview yesterday that I did not know. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=532.0600000000001s)]
*  He was talking about the gigantic fraud loophole that the NGOs get all this money from the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=535.1800000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=541.5s)]
*  down there at the border that take the migrants, they give them shelter, they help them, who [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=543.5s)]
*  knows what they're giving them, but it's all government grants. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=549.06s)]
*  Those are your tax dollars. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=552.58s)]
*  So he said these NGOs, they have no, we have no control over them. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=553.94s)]
*  We give them the money and they can use it however they want. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=558.18s)]
*  He also talked about that this is going to be a temporary agency. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=560.48s)]
*  So Elon Musk is spending so much time, he's getting harassed, death threats, his businesses [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=564.18s)]
*  are getting caught on fire and then also the charging stations, people are setting those [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  on fire. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=574.6600000000001s)]
*  All of this stocks are down. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=575.6600000000001s)]
*  He did all of this for our country and he's spending 18 months carrying out this mission. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=577.34s)]
*  He says until July 4th of 2026, they're cutting trillions of dollars from the national deficit. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=581.6600000000001s)]
*  So Larry asked him, are you going to stick around for another year? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=586.22s)]
*  And he said, yes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=588.98s)]
*  And so the question is, how's he going to be able to do that? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  Because he's, he's a special government employee right now. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  You can only work 130 days. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  Maybe he will have another classification, but nonetheless, he's sticking around until [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=597.66s)]
*  it's all over. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsBgcmjRYXI&t=601.5799999999999s)]
