# 'Not a coincidence': Feds face questions over Eric Adams indictment
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q)
*  Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the first city in New York City mayor [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=1.08s)]
*  to face criminal charges, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=3.36s)]
*  and Mayor Eric Adams says it's all payback [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=4.88s)]
*  for calling out the Biden-Harris border failures. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=7.62s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=9.98s)]
*  I have been fighting injustice my entire life. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=11.64s)]
*  That fight has continued as your mayor. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=15.96s)]
*  Despite our police, when the federal government did nothing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=20.28s)]
*  as its broken immigration policies [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=24.34s)]
*  overloaded our shelter system with no relief, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=27.0s)]
*  I have been facing these lies for months [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=29.8s)]
*  since I began to speak out for all of you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=33.96s)]
*  Joining us now to react, New York City [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=37.28s)]
*  GOP councilman Joe Borrelli. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=39.04s)]
*  Joe, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=42.3s)]
*  Hopefully you can give us some insight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=44.68s)]
*  Look, I don't know if he's innocent or guilty. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=46.24s)]
*  I just find the timing a little coincidental, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and I don't believe in coincidences and politics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=52.84s)]
*  He was a co-chair of the campaign for Biden and Harris, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=56.92s)]
*  and all of a sudden when he starts to criticize them [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=61.28s)]
*  on their migrant crisis, he gets an investigation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=67.94s)]
*  No, and certainly four years ago or so, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=69.9s)]
*  I would have never questioned the impartiality of the DOJ, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=72.28s)]
*  but that question doesn't exist only when it's someone [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=75.76s)]
*  I happen to support is a target of that investigation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=79.16s)]
*  And there's a lot of things with this case [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=83.0s)]
*  that just might be a hair too cute. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  And again, he might be completely guilty, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=86.32s)]
*  but it is a little bit too cute [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=88.24s)]
*  that the police commissioner was hired a week later. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=89.8s)]
*  His home gets raided for documents. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=92.72s)]
*  Right, for documents from 20 years ago, Lawrence. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=95.88s)]
*  And it's not a coincidence that they raided [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=98.52s)]
*  this campaign staffer's home the day he was going [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=100.6s)]
*  to the White House to tell Joe Biden [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=103.6s)]
*  to end the migrant crisis. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=105.88s)]
*  So this might just be a coincidence, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=107.16s)]
*  but I don't believe in coincidences. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Joe, we're also waiting for the indictment to come out [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=111.24s)]
*  so we can know some of the charges, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  but some of the allegations is a lot [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=115.52s)]
*  of these foreign governments, all these businessmen [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=118.24s)]
*  were giving him some money to his campaign. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=120.64s)]
*  In return, there would be some calls made to City Hall [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=122.88s)]
*  or whatever to get permits and all that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  Every mayor I know of does that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=130.68s)]
*  And as honest as we like them to be, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=133.56s)]
*  they always get contributions to their campaigns. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=136.42s)]
*  So are we gonna investigate all the rest of them as well? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=139.04s)]
*  Right, and that's really the crux [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  of what we're talking about. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's why so many of us are so eager [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  for this indictment to be unsealed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  If it's a weak case, then it only goes in further [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=150.44s)]
*  to what I was saying about the impartiality of the DOJ. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=153.2s)]
*  I mean, right now we just simply don't know. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  If it's beyond the scope and it's beyond taking [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=157.92s)]
*  Turkish airline tickets or a free meal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=160.6s)]
*  or something like that, yeah, it is troubling [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  and it could end his mayoralty. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  But I'll also point out, Lawrence, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  that the people who are chomping at the bit [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  and who are excited about this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=170.36s)]
*  are the far left politicians in New York City [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=171.96s)]
*  who believe they can take over this city [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=174.84s)]
*  if something happens to them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, they also don't like his response to crime [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=177.72000000000003s)]
*  in this city, which you had a mayor before [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  that didn't support the police and he's a former cop. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=183.36s)]
*  He supported the cops here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  They've changed, I mean, I'm not saying things [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=187.56s)]
*  are perfect in the city right now, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=189.0s)]
*  but there has been a little bit more [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=190.96s)]
*  of going on the offense, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=193.44000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Lawrence, I disagree with Mayor Adams [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=196.68s)]
*  as a Republican half the time, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  but I could assure you if the public advocate, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=201.0s)]
*  Jumaane Williams or the comptroller, Brad Lander, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=202.76s)]
*  if these people whose names will be familiar [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=205.28s)]
*  to Americans very soon, if these people lead the city, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=207.92s)]
*  I'll be disagreeing with them 99% of the time at least. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=211.04s)]
*  Yeah, or Cuomo, who wants to make a return [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=215.2s)]
*  after killing the grandmothers and grandfathers [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=218.28s)]
*  in the nursing home. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=221.24s)]
*  Joe, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttYon2WrI6Q&t=222.32s)]
