# 'NO COMMENT': Kamala Harris completely dodges question on key policy issue
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s)
*  We're just one day away from election day and the Harris campaign has yet to clarify [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=0.0s)]
*  their position on a number of topics. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=7.0s)]
*  That according to a new report in Axios, Julian Turner is live at the White House. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=9.32s)]
*  Julian. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=13.32s)]
*  Hey Brian. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=14.32s)]
*  Well, VP Harris used the weekend to continue her blitz across swing states and stay in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=15.32s)]
*  the headlines, but she did not though add any more detail on her policy platforms on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=18.6s)]
*  some key issues like immigration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=24.36s)]
*  Obviously an issue that has voters in some key battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=26.44s)]
*  though they're not border states, expressing unease about her record on immigration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=36.92s)]
*  Harris herself declined to say over the weekend how she filled out her own California ballot [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=37.92s)]
*  on a tough on crime measure. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=42.8s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=44.6s)]
*  How did you vote on Prop 36? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=46.42s)]
*  So I have my ballot is on its way to California and I'm going to trust the system that it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=48.96s)]
*  will arrive there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=54.84s)]
*  And I am not going to talk about the vote on that because honestly it's the Sunday [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=57.08s)]
*  before the election and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=61.84s)]
*  it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=67.28s)]
*  So well, she also has yet to clarify whether she stands by her promise to end immigration [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=68.28s)]
*  detention or supports executive actions to provide a path to citizenship for about two [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  million dreamers in this country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=77.34s)]
*  All this prompting a new Axios report out calling her quote the no comment candidate [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=79.52s)]
*  Harris's strategy clouds how she would govern her rival. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=84.6s)]
*  Former President Trump has yet to put forward details on his own signature plan to deport [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=88.72s)]
*  millions of illegal immigrants, but his stance does remain clear. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=99.44s)]
*  or a law enforcement officer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=105.12s)]
*  So neither Biden or Harris are here at the White House right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=109.72s)]
*  President Biden is going to head back here in a few hours. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=113.12s)]
*  We don't expect to hear anything from him today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=115.94s)]
*  Publicly, Brian Harris for her part continuing her blitz across Pennsylvania. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=118.4s)]
*  Presumably we'll see her back here in Washington tomorrow. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=123.16s)]
*  Jillian, it's unbelievable. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  The White House people be the quietest the day before Election Day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=127.04s)]
*  Jillian Turner, thanks so much. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Hey, let's bring in Harris campaign, Sarah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Get Democratic Senator Chris Murphy to respond. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=134.88000000000002s)]
*  Senator, how do you feel about Axios calling her the no comment candidate when it comes [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=137.28s)]
*  to this issue in particular on Prop 36 out in California? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=141.52s)]
*  Well, to me, the two candidates positions on immigration are crystal clear. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris has endorsed a very specific detailed piece of legislation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=151.4s)]
*  That's the bipartisan border security bill that I negotiated with very conservative [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=156.44s)]
*  Republican James Lankford that would dramatically increase investment on the border. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=160.32s)]
*  It would allow the president to shut down the border when crossings got too high. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=165.64s)]
*  It would fix our broken asylum system so that nobody gets to stay in this country for five [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=169.6s)]
*  or 10 years with their asylum claims being processed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=174.12s)]
*  Donald Trump killed that bill, even though it was supported by conservative Republicans [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=176.84s)]
*  and the Border Patrol. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=180.68s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I don't know about. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about California's ballot questions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=184.4s)]
*  I live in Connecticut, but I'm just saying this idea that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=187.48s)]
*  people don't know what Kamala Harris is for on immigration is just not true. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=190.28s)]
*  She supports a very specific piece of legislation that Donald Trump opposes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=193.8s)]
*  Well, can I just show you just on Prop 36, it's pretty specific. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=197.96s)]
*  They're essentially going to they're essentially going to put in hard criminal [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=203.48s)]
*  stop the stop the penalties, stop being easy on the criminal, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=211.6s)]
*  be tougher on crime, make shoplifting a felony, increase penalties for drug charges, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  senses for selling certain drugs such as fentanyl, heroin and cocaine, make them tougher, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=222.6s)]
*  require warnings of possible murder charges for selling or providing drugs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=227.04s)]
*  So if you want to be tough on crime, why not just say how you voted there? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I heard what she said at the outset of the show that she's not interested in, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=237.32s)]
*  you know, weighing in on a California ballot measure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=241.27999999999997s)]
*  She's running for president of the United States. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=243.56s)]
*  You know, you can compare the two candidates' records on immigration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  There are less people crossing at the border today than during Donald Trump's presidency. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=249.72s)]
*  But you can also compare their records on crime. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=253.88s)]
*  Crime shot up when Donald Trump was president. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=256.4s)]
*  At the end of Donald Trump's presidency, we were less safe. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=259.2s)]
*  Crime has come down under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=261.56s)]
*  Do you really think you have a strong argument there from the party that gave you to fund the police? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=265.12s)]
*  You've got to be kidding me. Who's tougher on crime? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=269.08s)]
*  Trump or her? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=271.92s)]
*  But look at the data, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=274.88s)]
*  Crime has come down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  We have 20% fewer urban homicides. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=278.56s)]
*  They revamped their crime stats and they went up to 4.2%. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  Increase. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=287.28s)]
*  Urban gun homicides have come down in this country by 20%. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  Mass shootings are 20% fewer this year than last year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=292.96s)]
*  It is just absolutely true that there are fewer gun homicides in this country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  And I know that that's inconvenient, but that is the truth. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  Senator, you know what's the truth? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  You have an opportunity to show you're tough on crime by saying, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=304.8s)]
*  I back the ballot measure that shows the folly of the easy on crime policies that she was a part of. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  But she says, that's not up to me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=315.04s)]
*  I also want you to hear she does not answer that question. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  She also didn't answer these questions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=319.56s)]
*  Are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=322.6s)]
*  I will follow the law. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=332.04s)]
*  Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=334.6s)]
*  You called it stupid, useless and a medieval vanity project. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=337.88s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=342.48s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=344.4s)]
*  So remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=348.08s)]
*  Come on, they didn't. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=352.24s)]
*  How much of that wall did he build? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=354.4s)]
*  I think the last number I saw is about 2%. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=356.2s)]
*  But you do want to build some wall. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=358.52s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  So why wouldn't she use that opportunity to explain her change in that opportunity? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  For example, on transgender surgeries for criminals, illegal aliens in prison. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  I'll follow the law. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Why not use that opportunity to say, I would not pay for that? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Because that's not where the American people are at. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  What's interesting to me is that estimates are that like 40% of all of Trump's ads are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=383.88s)]
*  about transgender kids, as if that's the biggest threat to this country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=390.64s)]
*  I mean, I heard folks on your previous segment talking about grocery prices, but that's not [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  what most people care about in this country. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=401.2s)]
*  They care about prices. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=402.55999999999995s)]
*  They care about public safety. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=403.96s)]
*  They don't think that 40% of the conversation in this campaign should be about transgender kids. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=405.52s)]
*  And as for the border wall, listen, I'm fine with building some additional border wall, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=412.4s)]
*  but we had funding in that bipartisan border bill to put thousands of new border agents, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=417.08s)]
*  more technology to stop the government crossing the border. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=423.44s)]
*  And Donald Trump opposed it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=426.44s)]
*  Listen, I think it was great that you three worked on that with Sinema, but it was a starting [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=428.96s)]
*  point. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=434.28s)]
*  And he had eight people, Democrats in Congress, in the Senate, weren't going to vote for it, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=435.28s)]
*  and they didn't allow any amendments. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  But having said that, that's got to be something that people share if you're going to do immigration [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=441.84s)]
*  reform. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=446.67999999999995s)]
*  But I'm just going to add to this. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=447.67999999999995s)]
*  The Senate is something you also care about. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=449.4s)]
*  Jamie Raskin on with Bill Maher over the weekend and talked about if they get the majority, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=452.0s)]
*  if you get the majority, what will happen? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  Even though he's in the House, this is his focus. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  We're stuck with another anti-democratic mechanism, which is the filibuster on the Senate side. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  So we got to deal with that too. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=468.2s)]
*  But I think that's what this campaign is about. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=469.92s)]
*  When we say we're defending democracy against the autocrats, the plutocrats, the theocrats, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=471.68s)]
*  the dictators and the despots, it's a little bit deceptive because it implies that democracy [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=477.24s)]
*  is just a static collection of institutions and rules. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=481.8s)]
*  Actually, democracy, as Lincoln knew, is an unfinished project. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=485.48s)]
*  It's always in motion. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=490.04s)]
*  He says the focus for him and the party are making Puerto Rico a state, blowing up the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=491.88s)]
*  filibuster and getting rid of the Electoral College. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=497.56s)]
*  Do you share in that mission? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, Kamala Harris is going to speak for herself. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=505.4s)]
*  I mean, of course, every Democrat has their own set of priorities. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, when it comes to the filibuster, here's what I think we should do. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=511.24s)]
*  I think we should go back to the old fashioned talking filibuster. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=515.12s)]
*  If you want to filibuster a bill, then stand up there and have the courage to explain why [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  you're against it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that Republicans would filibuster an increase in the minimum wage [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=524.32s)]
*  if they had to stand up there and explain why they want people to make less money. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=528.48s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  But if what about do you want that? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=534.6s)]
*  I go ahead. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=535.6s)]
*  As Kamala Harris said, that that's part of her part of her platform. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=536.76s)]
*  I mean, you can you can debate individual members of Congress's priorities or we can [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=540.0s)]
*  spend the last 24 hours of this campaign talking about the differences between Kamala Harris [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=544.08s)]
*  and Donald Trump. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=548.44s)]
*  They are the two people that everybody in this country are going to be voting for. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=549.44s)]
*  And Kamala Harris's agenda is to grow this economy from the middle out, make our streets [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  safer, work on bipartisan immigration reform. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's agenda in his final few days of the campaign seems to be to divide us from [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=559.88s)]
*  each other, to talk about his massive tax cut for billionaires and to continue to engage [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=563.92s)]
*  in this really divisive rhetoric. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=570.56s)]
*  But he doesn't have that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=572.24s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=573.24s)]
*  85 85 percent of his 85 percent of his tax cut that he passed in his first term went [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=574.24s)]
*  to the top one percent of income. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=578.64s)]
*  No, it didn't. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=579.88s)]
*  We got no it didn't. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=580.88s)]
*  We got little peanuts for the for the for the rest of us. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=581.92s)]
*  Senator, the numbers don't lie. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=584.52s)]
*  The people that benefit the most from the tax cut is the middle class. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=586.92s)]
*  And now you have an opportunity to renew those tax cuts because they're coming up for they're [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=591.16s)]
*  going to expire. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's just not that's just not true. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=597.88s)]
*  80 80 plus percent of that tax cut went to the very, very wealthy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=599.52s)]
*  The corporations got a bigger tax cut than they'd even ever imagined. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=603.12s)]
*  By the time Donald Trump was done as president, our economy was in freefall. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=606.4s)]
*  This President Joe Biden, which is a pandemic, created more jobs, created more jobs than [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=610.28s)]
*  any than than any president in the history of the country in their first four years [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=615.0s)]
*  during the pandemic. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=620.0s)]
*  If you count the numbers lost during the pandemic, once in a lifetime, a pandemic that Donald [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=621.0s)]
*  Trump badly mismanaged, people died under Biden with a vaccine that died under Trump [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  without one. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=630.56s)]
*  Yeah, my folks in Connecticut care about creating jobs, they care about manufacturing jobs. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=633.6s)]
*  And what we've seen is a is a renaissance of manufacturing jobs in this country in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=638.48s)]
*  last few years. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=642.6400000000001s)]
*  And we got to do we got to do better. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=643.6400000000001s)]
*  We got to do more. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=644.7600000000001s)]
*  And we frankly have to find a way to bring Republicans and Democrats together around [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=645.7600000000001s)]
*  the real industrial agenda. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=649.5200000000001s)]
*  And I just think it's much, much more likely that that happens. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=650.5200000000001s)]
*  We just don't know what the vice president stands for. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=653.6s)]
*  Under Kamala Harris, then under then under Donald Trump, who is never able to bring Republicans [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=656.1600000000001s)]
*  and Democrats together, unfortunately. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=661.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, have you seen Joe Biden do that? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=662.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=665.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=666.52s)]
*  I've seen him do it on infrastructure. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=667.52s)]
*  I've seen him do it on guns. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=668.64s)]
*  I've seen him do it on infrastructure, on industrial policy over and over and over again. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=669.76s)]
*  Joe Biden was able to pass significant bipartisan legislation. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=673.8s)]
*  He ends with 40 percent approval rating. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=677.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's at 47. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=680.0s)]
*  We're going to see what's going to happen in 24 hours. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=681.32s)]
*  Senator Murphy, thanks so much. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1GF9eKR71s&t=683.28s)]
