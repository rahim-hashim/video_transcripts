# 'HAT IN HAND': Newsom goes to White House after 'Trump-proofing' California
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g)
*  Gavin Newsom. He and Donald Trump have not seen eye to eye, right, for a long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=0.0s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is asking the homeless to come to California. The taxes are so expensive. He's lost [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  a lot of people. They're dealing with the wildfires. So a few, what was it, a week ago, Donald Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  went to California, came off the tarmac, and there was Gavin Newsom. They shook hands and they had [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=16.0s)]
*  conversations and they toured the disaster areas. Then Gavin Newsom went to the White House yesterday [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=20.56s)]
*  to ask for some federal money for the people and the businesses who lost everything in the fire. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=26.24s)]
*  This is what Gavin said after the president met with him. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=32.8s)]
*  I look forward to more productive meetings and I look forward to the spirit that defined the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  meetings of this day, that spirit of collaboration, cooperation. The spirit defines the best [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=41.68s)]
*  American people. Yeah, look, I don't know what happened at the meeting, but it's not a great [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=47.04s)]
*  start when your state wants to put out Trump-proofing agenda items. I mean, it was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=52.88s)]
*  always destined that there was going to be some fire, some national tragedy in California where [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  they would need the federal government to step in. I don't know how you start off a conversation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=67.44s)]
*  saying, oh, Mr. President, by the way, we Trump-proofed it, but we need your assistance right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=72.72s)]
*  Well, they're not saying it. He goes and meets with a series of attorneys at a cost of $25 million [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=76.72s)]
*  they want to Trump-proof California to be ready to challenge all the actions, like, for example, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=83.44s)]
*  the ability for ICE to function in that state outside Orange County. They're a sanctuary state. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=88.56s)]
*  So if you're going to pay $25 million to challenge all Donald Trump and his administration's efforts [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  in California, then don't ask for additional money to bail out California. You know, fire recovery [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  worked for the budget passed. They got $2.5 billion. Sadly, the estimate damages $250 billion. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=105.2s)]
*  You need the federal government to help. Now, $25 million compared to $250 billion is small. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=111.2s)]
*  I get it. But don't tell me that you're going to use money that you have in a state running a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=115.84s)]
*  deficit before the devastating fires to fight programs I haven't even presented yet, at the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=121.44s)]
*  same time come in hat in hand and say, I want to work with you. Can't have it both ways. Same thing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=126.16s)]
*  with the governor of New York. Governor Hocle and President Trump have had some positive conversations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=130.48s)]
*  She says, please leave the congestion pricing of $9 a hit in New York. I know you could take it out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=134.96s)]
*  Don't leave a least defining seat open until the fall. Something's got to happen. This is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=141.28s)]
*  called coal leverage. Can't have it both ways. There has to be a deal. Close her seat. Make sure [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=147.04s)]
*  we fill that seat and the voters that live in her district get to decide. And in exchange, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=152.0s)]
*  I won't go after that tax that you have levied on all the people who drive in New York City. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=156.24s)]
*  Same with Gavin Newsom. Fix your state. Make sure the water is working. Make sure you lower taxes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=160.48s)]
*  You know, it's give and take. We do want to help the people that lost everything in California. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  This is what they're doing in California. This was cut right across party lines. All the Democrats, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=171.84s)]
*  they voted for 25. You're right when you said it was 25 million to challenge the actions by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump and his administration. But in addition to that, another 25 million to defend [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  the migrants facing possible deportation. Well, he can still veto this. He has approved. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=191.84s)]
*  This is opportunity to take a stand and say, you know what, in the best interest of our state, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=198.0s)]
*  we're going to let this die. And what about that horrendous video in my view over the weekend [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=203.68s)]
*  when they shut down the 101 freeway in Los Angeles and with these illegal immigrants, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=208.08s)]
*  allegedly holding up Mexican flags, El Salvadorian flags and Columbia flags. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Now it's going to make it easier for Tom Homan to know what country to send him back to. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=218.4s)]
*  So that's a little helpful. But they let the cops let this happen. This was an unpermitted riot. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=221.68s)]
*  They know how to clear a street. Instead, some of them were attacked and sold and they were [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=227.44s)]
*  allowed to. So this has got to come up in the conversation. Hey, Gavin, don't let this happen [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=231.84s)]
*  in your state. Don't put 50 million against me in your state. Don't campaign against me in your [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  state and then beg the federal government to bail you out when you didn't do everything possible [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=242.08s)]
*  to minimize the wildfires that are inevitable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyLfOjNTD7g&t=246.64000000000001s)]
