# Anti-Israel activists applaud Iran's attack on Israel in 'appalling' video
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4)
*  Well, our president has said that we will not get involved. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=0.0s)]
*  He doesn't want to be involved in a counterattack. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=2.92s)]
*  But he's right, they have to walk a fine line. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=4.84s)]
*  Do they attack back and say, you're not, you can't do this to our country? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  What does Benjamin Netanyahu do? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=11.08s)]
*  Probably his time as prime minister is coming to an end. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=13.0s)]
*  So does he go ahead and respond? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=15.68s)]
*  Well, it's not, I think he's got a few apps. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the early, they'll co-elections is August, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And that would even be a little quick. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=22.92s)]
*  I would say this, I think they have to attack. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=24.96s)]
*  I mean, how do you possibly let somebody get you with 300 ballistic missiles, drones, cruise [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=27.52s)]
*  missiles from various locations? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=33.04s)]
*  And you know, some of those rockets were heading towards Jerusalem, where Palestinians are [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=35.4s)]
*  on a regular basis at that holy site. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=39.6s)]
*  And then when you get up in the morning and find out, as bad as it was, it could have [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=41.96s)]
*  been 50% worse. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=45.24s)]
*  I mean, that seems to me less and less measured and more like ineptness. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=46.24s)]
*  And also Jordan, France, UK, US, and this sophisticated missile defense system all had [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=50.96s)]
*  to combine to stop this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=57.0s)]
*  But if you begin to accept that Iran is going to be attacking Israel, you get you up the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=58.64s)]
*  threshold because we never thought in the beginning Hamas rockets into Israel were going [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=63.32s)]
*  to last. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=67.68s)]
*  Now it's part of their daily lives. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=68.68s)]
*  So what else? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=70.12s)]
*  Now Hezbollah, part of their daily lives. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=71.12s)]
*  Now we're supposed to say Iran to every day they could attack. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=73.16s)]
*  Well, Brian, you talked about accepting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=76.64s)]
*  And one of the things that I've been talking, been quite vocal about the stuff that's happening [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=78.64s)]
*  here at home, these chants that are going on. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is a chant that started in Chicago after they got news what was happening in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=85.56s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=90.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=91.88s)]
*  I just have to report something to everyone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=92.88s)]
*  And so it begins. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=96.56s)]
*  Iran has just responded about 30 minutes ago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=98.56s)]
*  There are reports of drones having been fired on Israel from Yemen and Iraq. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=104.56s)]
*  This is when this country and the world needs us because the United States is going to quote [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=113.68s)]
*  unquote defend the criminal Israeli state. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  And we all of the anti-war committees here, all of the Palestine support coalitions here [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  must be ready immediately to be out in the streets and to stop the U.S. from expanding [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=132.88s)]
*  this war on Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=139.52s)]
*  You know, Charlie, we keep pretending like we don't understand what these people mean. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=142.2s)]
*  I mean, it's all over the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  They're saying that they hate the country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=148.76s)]
*  They're saying to the river, to the sea. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=151.0s)]
*  And we keep saying, oh, it's just free speech. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  It's free speech until they decide to attack us here at home. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=155.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=158.2s)]
*  And after October 7th, there were a lot of people who said that they were upset and stood [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=159.2s)]
*  up for innocent civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course, everybody's concerned about innocent civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=166.78s)]
*  But this rips the bandaid off of that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=169.88s)]
*  There are people who they don't care about innocent civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=171.6s)]
*  They hate Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=175.48s)]
*  They hate the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=176.48s)]
*  And they want to see both destroyed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  And they're not even pretending to window dress it by claiming to care about innocent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=180.32s)]
*  Palestinians, which of course they don't care about. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=186.76s)]
*  The leading terrorists making the lives of Palestinians miserable are Hamas and their [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  supporters like these clowns in Chicago. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=196.4s)]
*  There were 300 anti-war activists. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=199.84s)]
*  They were meeting in the basement of the Teamsters Union headquarters on Saturday. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=202.04s)]
*  They were describing their plans to disrupt the Democratic National Convention, which [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=206.22s)]
*  is coming up in August. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=210.56s)]
*  We'll all be there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=211.56s)]
*  And then this happens. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=212.84s)]
*  The man takes the podium and he announces that there's eruption. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=213.84s)]
*  Everyone in that room, Brian, I thought of you, was wearing the N95 masks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=217.24s)]
*  And one guy in the back takes it down and starts whistling. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=221.26s)]
*  But yeah, they're... [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=223.72s)]
*  And can I just say one thing about this? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=225.6s)]
*  What's so appalling about this is that Democrats are still going to try to curry favor with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=227.48s)]
*  these people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=231.44s)]
*  Democrats are still trying to win these people's votes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=232.44s)]
*  Real quickly before we go to Brian, the masks, because I've been to a lot of these protests, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=235.68s)]
*  aren't because of COVID. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=240.28s)]
*  They're putting the mask on because they don't want people to see their identity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=241.28s)]
*  CBS did a poll and they asked Democrats, are you in support of giving weapons to Israel? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=245.92s)]
*  In October, 47% said yes, which is astoundingly low. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=251.2s)]
*  Except for now, it's now at 32%. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  The future of U.S.-Israeli relations with this next generation of Democrats is not there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=257.24s)]
*  And that is exactly what the Palestinians wanted. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=262.32s)]
*  That's exactly what Iran wants. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=264.56s)]
*  Their propaganda effort inside the U.S. is working. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=266.48s)]
*  They have to feel like they're making progress. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=269.96s)]
*  Don't you think that's why Joe Biden has said he won't support a counterattack? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=272.0s)]
*  He won't support Israel's counterattack? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  He's afraid of losing Michigan and Minnesota. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=276.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpFOeyin7Y4&t=280.6s)]
