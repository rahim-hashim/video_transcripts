# China is watching Taiwan 'like a hawk': Expert
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk)
*  Fox News alert right now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=0.0s)]
*  growing tensions for US forces in the mid-East. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  Iran's attack on Israel coming just days [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=5.12s)]
*  after the White House urged China to use its ties to Iran [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  to stop them from attacking Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=11.84s)]
*  Victoria Coats served as deputy national security advisor [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=14.58s)]
*  under President Trump, and she joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=17.84s)]
*  Victoria, it's always great to have you on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=20.64s)]
*  and get your perspective. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  So the Biden administration reached out to China [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=23.56s)]
*  and said, help us here, help us get Iran [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=26.8s)]
*  to not attack Israel, and obviously that didn't work. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=30.92s)]
*  What does that tell you about our relationship, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=34.92s)]
*  Joe Biden's relationship with China, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=38.24s)]
*  how much influence he has over them or not? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=40.4s)]
*  Well, good morning, Rachel, good to be with you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=45.16s)]
*  You know, this is ridiculous. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=47.2s)]
*  It's like the situation with Ukraine [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=48.64s)]
*  when apparently the Biden administration reached out [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=51.08s)]
*  to China to say, please, restrain Russia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=53.72s)]
*  And of course, Russia has been anything but restrained now [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=56.62s)]
*  for more than two years. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  It's the same thing with Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=61.18s)]
*  I think what the Biden administration needs to understand [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=62.98s)]
*  is these things are not happening despite China. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  They're happening because China's just fine, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=69.02s)]
*  having the United States tied up, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=71.56s)]
*  both in Europe and in the Middle East. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=73.86s)]
*  They think this is great. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was just gonna say, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=77.82s)]
*  this is completely in China's interest. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  Maybe you could break that down [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=81.7s)]
*  for people who maybe aren't connecting all the dots. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=83.16s)]
*  Why would China want us tied down [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=85.58s)]
*  in all these different wars? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  Well, because China, of course, is eyeing Taiwan. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=91.62s)]
*  And Dr. Kevin Roberts, the president of Heritage, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=94.42s)]
*  and I actually went to both Taiwan and Japan six weeks ago [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=97.14s)]
*  to sort of see what we could lay of the land on the ground. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=101.14s)]
*  And China is watching Taiwan like a hawk. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=104.38s)]
*  They, Xi Jinping, the chairman [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=108.06s)]
*  of the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=110.46s)]
*  has signaled that he wants to take Taiwan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=111.96s)]
*  And my fear is that they think this year [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=114.26s)]
*  would be their window of maximum opportunity for that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=117.1s)]
*  And so for them to take Taiwan, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=121.26s)]
*  they need the United States to be distracted. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=123.46s)]
*  They need us to exhaust our resources, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=126.26s)]
*  particularly in Ukraine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=130.2s)]
*  But they also are gonna need a lot of energy, Rachel, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=132.1s)]
*  because they don't have any domestically. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=134.7s)]
*  And so what they're doing is buying up now [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=137.14s)]
*  more than 2 million barrels a day out of Iran, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=139.9s)]
*  is going to China at cheap discounted prices. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=143.16s)]
*  And they're stockpiling that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=146.12s)]
*  Same thing with Russia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=147.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=149.6s)]
*  I mean, this is actually a very scary situation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=150.44s)]
*  You see, there's probably only six months left [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=152.64s)]
*  for China to make a move with Taiwan. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=155.16s)]
*  We still have the war in Ukraine [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=158.64s)]
*  that doesn't seem to be going very well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=161.5s)]
*  And now we're on the precipice of a larger regional war [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=163.64s)]
*  in the Middle East, perhaps. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=167.2s)]
*  What worries you the most here? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=170.12s)]
*  Do you really think that we could be on the verge [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=171.88s)]
*  of something like a World War III? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=173.84s)]
*  And what can be done to stop that trajectory? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=175.52s)]
*  Well, however, ironically, in 2020, during the campaign, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden was saying over and over again [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=185.18s)]
*  that Donald Trump was bringing us to the edge of war. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=187.88s)]
*  Turns out it's actually Joe Biden. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=190.92s)]
*  It sure is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=192.62s)]
*  Victoria, great having you on. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=193.62s)]
*  Thanks so much for your insights. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRY0U-k5jtk&t=194.96s)]
