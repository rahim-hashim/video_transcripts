# Swing-state voter to CNN: Still favoring Trump after debate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU)
*  But Ainsley, when you look at the dials, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, we all had our analysis yesterday about the debate, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=2.44s)]
*  but when you look at the dials for independent voters, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=5.3s)]
*  when they solve the immigration issue discussed, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=7.74s)]
*  it shoots up not only with Republicans, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=10.98s)]
*  but independents as well. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=13.48s)]
*  So we wanna cherry pick different moments, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=15.26s)]
*  but when it came down to the issues, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=17.92s)]
*  it looked like it had an impact on the voters. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=20.02s)]
*  What's interesting about this election [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=21.86s)]
*  that I don't ever remember seeing in my lifetime, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=23.62s)]
*  we have two candidates who have been in the White House. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=26.5s)]
*  Yes, both. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=29.54s)]
*  Kamala for the last four years [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=30.38s)]
*  as Vice President, Donald Trump, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=31.58s)]
*  four years before that as President. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=33.14s)]
*  So we know where they both stand. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=34.98s)]
*  And that's why that first question in the debate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=36.68s)]
*  was so important. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=38.58s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=39.42s)]
*  Were you better off under him or under her? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=40.48s)]
*  And I've heard people say, this is an issues election. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=42.78s)]
*  You might not like the personality of her, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=47.06s)]
*  her flip-flopping, you might not like his personality, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=48.72s)]
*  but how do they vote? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=51.42s)]
*  What is their record? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=52.82s)]
*  Are you better off? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=54.0s)]
*  And to that point, there's an item in the, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=54.84s)]
*  that they just posted on the New York Times website. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=57.5s)]
*  They talked a little bit about last, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=60.36s)]
*  the debate a couple of nights ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  And so what the Harris camp is encouraged by [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=64.8s)]
*  is the fact that she was able to make the debate [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=70.64s)]
*  all about Donald Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=74.68s)]
*  And that was something that Joe Biden could not do [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=76.44s)]
*  during his year of running for President. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=80.36s)]
*  He could not do it, but she did it [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=82.42s)]
*  in a more effective way, essentially. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=85.24s)]
*  The reason it's important is that debate came two days ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=89.02s)]
*  Yesterday, Alabama sent out the first absentee ballots. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=95.42s)]
*  It was gonna be North Carolina, but RFK challenged it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  They got to reprint everything. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=100.9s)]
*  So Alabama sent out the absentee ballots. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=102.16s)]
*  People in Alabama now will be able to start voting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=105.3s)]
*  So here's what the undecided voters are saying. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=108.36s)]
*  And this is very interesting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=110.4s)]
*  It's separate from the fundings and the experts. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=111.54s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  I think it's important to remember that we are voting [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=115.94s)]
*  for the leader of our country and not who we like the most [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=118.64s)]
*  or who we want in our wedding party, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=121.94s)]
*  but who is actually going to make our country better. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=123.88s)]
*  And we're in an incredibly unique situation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=127.52s)]
*  where we've had both of the candidates in office before [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=130.12s)]
*  and we've gotten to see what they would do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  And when facts come to facts, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=134.96s)]
*  my life was better when Trump was in office. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=136.9s)]
*  The economy was higher, inflation was lower. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=138.8s)]
*  Things were better overall. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=141.6s)]
*  And now with Kamala's administration, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  things haven't been so fantastic. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=146.22s)]
*  And she's saying she can fix the problems [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  that her administration has caused, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=150.72s)]
*  but I just don't know if I can afford to take that risk. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  You go, that is the danger. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=155.06s)]
*  You wanted to talk about Donald Trump the entire debate, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=156.46s)]
*  but you forgot about the issues [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=159.16s)]
*  that matter to the American public. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=160.84s)]
*  People aren't trying to elect a priest right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=162.8s)]
*  They want someone that's gonna improve [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  the grocery prices. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  They still don't know where it is. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=168.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=169.78s)]
*  But what if they were the candidate [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=171.18s)]
*  for the thing you think they want them to say? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=172.10000000000002s)]
*  So she's saying, I'm gonna be tough on the border. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  But you haven't. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=176.72s)]
*  I did something before I was senator that I did it, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  and then you get to talk to Donald Trump [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  talking about something separate from what it's doing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  to the cities and states. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=183.96s)]
*  Did you just expect all the American public [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  to have amnesia about the last three and a half years? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=187.12s)]
*  They do remember and they're still experiencing the pain. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  Politico's got an item up right now [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  that talks about the dangers of underestimating Donald Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  They write in part, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=198.24s)]
*  but the most important political lesson [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  of the Trump era applies here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=201.68s)]
*  When all the corners of elite thinking are in agreement, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  whether it's on social media, Wall Street, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=206.3s)]
*  the Beltway, print newsrooms, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=208.16s)]
*  or in cable green rooms, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=209.6s)]
*  it's best to be very skeptical. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=212.3s)]
*  I love that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  And going forward, this item I refer to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=216.0s)]
*  in the New York Times, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=218.94s)]
*  because they get people close to the Kamala Harris campaign, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=220.24s)]
*  apparently she's going to be going to North Carolina today, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=222.74s)]
*  Pennsylvania tomorrow. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=226.38s)]
*  She's actually going to sit for interviews with local media [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  and she's gonna do an interview, I believe, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=231.24s)]
*  next week with the National Association of Black Journalists. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=233.44s)]
*  So let's see if they are able to get some of the questions [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=236.12s)]
*  answered that the ABC people could not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=240.76s)]
*  James Clyburn, y'all saw what he said yesterday. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=243.06s)]
*  Well, they didn't even ask. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=244.66s)]
*  James Clyburn said, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=245.66s)]
*  I hope she doesn't do one-on-one interviews [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=246.76s)]
*  because something she says could go in a negative way. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=248.46s)]
*  He wants to do town halls. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=251.06s)]
*  Something unscripted could go wrong. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=252.56s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=254.24s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFsfbOPwVU&t=255.14000000000001s)]
