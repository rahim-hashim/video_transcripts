# CNN reporter admits Trump's economy 'beating expectations' as Dems melt down
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8)
*  The month of June providing great job numbers, 147,000 jobs were added to the U.S. workforce [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=0.0s)]
*  with an unemployment rate dipping slightly to 4.1 percent, both figures defying expectations. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=7.8s)]
*  This is a nearly 6 percent increase from May where 139,000 jobs were added. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=15.26s)]
*  Let's bring in Taylor Riggs, co-host of the Big Money Show on Fox Business. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=22.32s)]
*  Great to see you, Taylor. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for joining us on Independence Day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=28.060000000000002s)]
*  Happy Fourth. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  So break the numbers down for us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  Actually, a really good report on the headline number, Defying Expectations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=32.96s)]
*  Even the whisper number on the street, we were thinking, oh my gosh, you get 100,000, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=36.86s)]
*  maybe 110,000, and you're pretty much blowing it out of the water with 147,000. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=41.28s)]
*  So you've heard a lot of people from the White House come out and say now for the fifth to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=46.44s)]
*  sixth month in a row, we are beating expectations. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=49.72s)]
*  And under the details, look, there's some positives, some negatives, but here's the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  positives. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=55.92s)]
*  Job openings relative to those seeking unemployment, 1.12 ratio. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=57.08s)]
*  There are jobs out there if people want to work. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=62.28s)]
*  Foreign-born workers are losing jobs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=66.0s)]
*  Native-born workers are gaining jobs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=68.6s)]
*  That further speaks to what the president has really been advocating for, of getting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  our own citizens really back to work. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=74.62s)]
*  So there were certainly some good numbers here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=77.36s)]
*  So they're so good that even like CNN is having to acknowledge their good numbers, watch this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=79.74s)]
*  This job market is like the Energizer Bunny. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=86.68s)]
*  Every single time we expect it to run out of steam, it just keeps going and going. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=89.26s)]
*  So these new numbers show that the U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=93.76s)]
*  That was well ahead of the expectation of about 118,000, well ahead of some whispers [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=99.2s)]
*  that we heard on Wall Street of a sub 100,000 number. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=104.68s)]
*  So this is indeed beating expectations. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=107.92s)]
*  All the doom and gloom predictions keep getting crushed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=111.72s)]
*  I know, they do. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=114.36s)]
*  Look, this is an economy, and I give it to him, has defied expectations. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=115.4s)]
*  It's a consumer-driven economy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=119.88s)]
*  And here's the good news. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=122.12s)]
*  Real wages are growing, which means wages after inflation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=123.72s)]
*  You're up two-tenths of one percent month over month, 3.7 percent year over year. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=128.0s)]
*  So if my wage is up 3.7 percent and inflation is two, I'm taking home a pay raise. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=133.2s)]
*  That's the sort of strength that you start to see in these numbers. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=139.32s)]
*  And that's really what President Trump promised on this blue-collar boom. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=142.16s)]
*  After inflation, am I actually getting more money or less in my pocket? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=145.76s)]
*  Well, meanwhile, Democrats are stuck making their arguments. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=150.8s)]
*  And many of their arguments are not only, I think, weak, but also flatly not true. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Listen to what Democrats are saying about the distortions ofâ€”regarding Medicaid in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=159.04s)]
*  the big, beautiful bill. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=165.2s)]
*  People will die as a result of the Republican assault on the health care of the American people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=166.64s)]
*  This bill hands $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=176.0s)]
*  People will die. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=181.6s)]
*  People will suffer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  People will die. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  And it will be at the hands of Republicans who vote yes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=185.04s)]
*  The top one percent are salivating over getting an extra $300,000 a year because of this dangerous bill. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=189.16s)]
*  Billionaires win. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=196.28s)]
*  That's the best they have. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Two quick points. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  20 hours a week in proven work requirements, less than in 1996 that Democrat Bill Clinton [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=200.16s)]
*  signed into law by a Republican Congress. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=209.0s)]
*  So this is less strict in terms of work requirements than we had in 1996 under a Democrat president. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=212.12s)]
*  Second, quick anecdote. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Walking out of my building a couple hours ago, lovely man who was helping me get out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=220.36s)]
*  and get here, I said, oh, you know, it's Fourth of July. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=225.72s)]
*  Is it hard to work? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=230.0s)]
*  And he said, no tax on overtime. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=231.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=233.24s)]
*  Thrilled to be here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=234.24s)]
*  This is not a billionaire who's getting a tax break. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=235.24s)]
*  This is a working class black man who is thrilled to be here and to watch that vote yesterday [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=238.64s)]
*  to make sure that his overtime and his tips were no longer going to be taxed in the middle [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=244.76s)]
*  of New York City. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=249.12s)]
*  Such a great story. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=250.4s)]
*  And you're such a great reporter. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=251.4s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkg2_0IOm8&t=252.88s)]
