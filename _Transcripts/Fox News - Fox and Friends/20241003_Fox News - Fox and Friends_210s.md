# Unsealed filing in Trump election case blasted as 'blatant election interference'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc)
*  Meanwhile back here in the United States new court filings unsealed yesterday in special counsel Jack Smith's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=0.0s)]
*  Investigation into President Donald Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  But the former president is calling out the DOJ's timing posting quote for 60 days prior to an election the Department of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Injustice is supposed to do absolutely nothing that would taint or interfere with a case [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=14.96s)]
*  They disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=19.92s)]
*  Joining us now is Fox News legal analyst Greg Jared so Jack Smith [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=25.32s)]
*  He gets overturned by the courts all the time and I just get an impression Greg that he's trying to litigate this case [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=29.48s)]
*  Before the public and not before the courts [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=36.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's trying to have a damning trial of Trump without a trial [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=41.04s)]
*  In the face of the fact that he couldn't get a trial before the election and you know releasing this motion [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  This court filing it it sure looks like blatant election interference [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  Lawrence, you know Trump's lawyers urged the judge keep it sealed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=57.48s)]
*  It'll impact the election. The judge did it anyway with almost no discussion and there's no good reason to make it public [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  It's premature. There isn't even a trial date [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=69.2s)]
*  So I think this was done knowing full well media and Democrats would seize on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=72.08s)]
*  Provocative details publicize it to affect voters and damage Trump and sure enough as I looked at television the internet [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=78.24s)]
*  Newspapers, that's what's happening [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=85.84s)]
*  But Greg is is there really much new here? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=88.16s)]
*  I mean Jack Smith has already made his case before the public and painted it broadly [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=91.48s)]
*  This just has some detail to it that we had not heard before and and Trump's own lawyers [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=96.2s)]
*  Don't even want to respond to any of the stuff he wrote about until three weeks after the election and they won't have to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  So much of it Steve you're right is gratuitous at times it reads like bad [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=110.08s)]
*  Detective fiction a lot of it is irrelevant and inadmissible [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Conversations that other people have that are not connected to Trump directly. So it seems like deliberate election interference and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  The incendiary details notwithstanding Smith's basic [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=130.24s)]
*  Accusations are the same that we've heard all along nothing's changed the theme that Trump deceived people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=134.4s)]
*  Well, if he honestly believed he won it's hard to prove otherwise [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=140.72s)]
*  What do you as a lawyer think he's doing is he trying to manipulate the language? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean because you say it's basically the same see manipulating the language to to get around that immunity decision [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=154.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's his great challenges to somehow [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=156.66s)]
*  circumvent the immunity decision here [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=160.26s)]
*  And that's what this motion is all about the problem for Smith is a lot of his evidence and testimony comes from public [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=163.22s)]
*  officials and their [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=171.06s)]
*  Conversations with Trump including the vice president under the Supreme Court decision that may well be protected information and thus inadmissible [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  In the filing Smith asserts nothing's protected and then all of a sudden he concedes [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=181.74s)]
*  Well, some of it is protected and immune but I can rebut the presumption of immunity. Well, that'll be up to a judge [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=187.54s)]
*  Exactly. All right. Thank you very much for joining us live. Thanks Greg. Great to see you. I'm Steve juicy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXMkFzLXfc&t=195.42000000000002s)]
