# NJ county sheriff on drone sightings: If this was a drill, we ‘miserably failed’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0)
*  Lawmakers desperate for answers as mystery drones buzz over New Jersey neighborhoods, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=0.0s)]
*  including my own house. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=5.0s)]
*  Now one of them pushing a new bill suggested by our next guest that would let law enforcement [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=6.8s)]
*  shoot them out of the sky, which by the way, President Trump suggested yesterday as well [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=12.72s)]
*  in a Truth Social Post. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=16.68s)]
*  Monmouth County, New Jersey Sheriff Sean Golden joins us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  And I don't mind telling you, Sheriff, this is a circumstance where it seems obvious to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=23.44s)]
*  just about everybody watching and listening. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=28.12s)]
*  You can't say on the one hand you have nothing to worry about. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  We have no evidence that this is a foreign power or nefarious. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=34.44s)]
*  And at the same time, you're not telling us exactly what is over the skies of the Garden [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  State. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=46.2s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=47.2s)]
*  I mean, that's the frustration, I think, right up into President Trump as he says, listen, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=48.2s)]
*  if they're not ours, shoot them down. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=52.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=54.28s)]
*  If this was a national security drill, we miserably failed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=55.6s)]
*  You know, drone technology is emerging so much faster, particularly in the defense field. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  And it's a matter of national security. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=65.36s)]
*  It's a matter of public safety here in New Jersey. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=67.76s)]
*  And so when I got together and sent a letter to Congressman Smith or our congressman here [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=69.84s)]
*  in Monmouth and Ocean County, where we've had a number of sightings, that letter said, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=76.0s)]
*  hey, we need some changes to the federal law. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=80.44s)]
*  We have to be able to protect our public and our residents here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=83.16s)]
*  And that would require loosening up and the ability for the state or at least the state [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=87.12s)]
*  policing units across the country to de-conflict and to de-drone, if necessary, meaning take [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=92.92s)]
*  down a drone. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=99.16s)]
*  So right now that rests solely with the federal government. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=100.16s)]
*  And I think that's the frustration because as you had said earlier in your show, is this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=102.8s)]
*  some type of federal agency? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=107.52s)]
*  Listen, these drones seem sophisticated by all accounts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=110.32s)]
*  We have a lot of false reporting. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  But the good accounts, we do have them from military bases, personnel, and from our own [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  first responders around northern New Jersey. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=119.72s)]
*  These things are definitely sophisticated, fast, turn the lights off at times. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  So we need to get a handle on what it is and who's running it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=127.32s)]
*  So Sheriff. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=132.72s)]
*  You know, we're from Jersey. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=133.72s)]
*  We can take the truth, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=135.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=136.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=137.76s)]
*  We did see a Chinese spy balloon go over our country and our government knew about it and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=139.0s)]
*  did nothing about it, which is why some people are like, it's possible it could be a foreign [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=142.84s)]
*  thing and our government's just so inept and so stupid or compromised or all of the above [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  that they're doing nothing about it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  But I think there was a drone, am I correct, that actually crashed and fell and New Jersey [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=153.6s)]
*  law enforcement saw that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=160.12s)]
*  What was, is that correct? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=163.04s)]
*  We don't have any report. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=164.04s)]
*  Yeah, we don't have any reports of a crash, a drone. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=165.04s)]
*  I will say this, you know, I think that was up in North, wasn't in our county. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=168.24s)]
*  We, you know, listen, we have a... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, that was a civilian drone. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=174.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=175.52s)]
*  But Sheriff, so it's illegal to shoot one down, correct? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=176.52s)]
*  Right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=179.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's illegal to shoot one down. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=180.96s)]
*  And so obviously we're telling our residents not to shoot them down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=182.12s)]
*  You'd be breaking some gun laws in New Jersey. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=185.08s)]
*  We don't want that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  And we certainly are worried about people's safety because as you pointed out in your [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  video, these things are large and, you know, they could be dangerous. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=191.36s)]
*  So at the end of the day, what we do need is more deconfliction legislation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=194.94s)]
*  Listen, I'm not about overregulation, but in this case, don't overregulate, just differentiate, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=199.74s)]
*  right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=205.66s)]
*  So we need identifiers on commercial and residential recreational drones. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=206.66s)]
*  You know, they were started, the FAA allowed them to fly in 2023 at night. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=211.86s)]
*  So some of these are recreational drones, very small, and some are commercial. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=216.5s)]
*  We see the testing going on with Amazon and Walmarts and the like, and, you know, the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=221.26s)]
*  skies are going to get crowded with these things. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=225.82s)]
*  And in order to guard public safety, and particularly national security, we're going to have to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  have laws that differentiate these objects. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=231.94s)]
*  Sheriff Sean Golden joining us from Monmouth County. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=235.1s)]
*  Sheriff, thank you so much and obviously best of luck as you try to work out that deconfliction [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=237.22s)]
*  that is so important. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=241.5s)]
*  Sheriff, thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=242.5s)]
*  Great. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=243.5s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=244.5s)]
*  Thank you, Sheriff. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=245.5s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=246.5s)]

*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdnGZhqwI0&t=248.5s)]
