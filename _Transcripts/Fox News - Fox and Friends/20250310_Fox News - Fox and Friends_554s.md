# 50 DAYS OF 'SUCCESS': Hosts reflect on Trump's accomplishments
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY)
*  Alright, four minutes now after the hour. Let's talk about what this marks, what this today is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=0.0s)]
*  We always talk about the first hundred days. What about the first fifty days? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=4.44s)]
*  Because the president, even his worst detractors, his biggest detractors, I have to admit, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=7.2s)]
*  is accomplishing a ton of things. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=11.4s)]
*  Also, the world is not slowing down with a myriad of challenges, which he was taking on over the weekend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=13.4s)]
*  Has an emissary dealing with Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Has a letter he's sending out to Iran, which is pretty much an ultimatum. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=22.52s)]
*  At the same time, a delegation to Saudi Arabia to try to bring peace with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=26.84s)]
*  And then there's just the things that he's doing because it's an agenda. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=32.68s)]
*  His agenda he wants to do, and that is change the direction of our economy, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=36.32s)]
*  make us less of an import economy, and start making things here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=40.32s)]
*  There's a huge transition in our economic focus right now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=46.92s)]
*  So there's a long list of what the president's been able to accomplish right now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=51.32s)]
*  Starting with the slashing the billions in waste via Doze. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=56.24s)]
*  He declared a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=60.32s)]
*  I mean, if you just look at the border, that's the biggest success. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=63.68s)]
*  I mean, you can't just you can't deny whether you love them or hate them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=66.56s)]
*  The border is secure right now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=69.8s)]
*  He sent troops to the border as well. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=71.96s)]
*  And he released dozens of got the release of the dozens of the Israeli hostages. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=73.92s)]
*  Yeah, that is wonderful. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=79.44s)]
*  Seeing those images of them coming home and hugging their parents and their loved ones. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Very emotional. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=85.48s)]
*  Also, the expansion of oil and gas production in the United States set tariffs on Mexico, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=86.64s)]
*  Canada and China to bring business back here to America. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=91.64s)]
*  Signed executive order banning trans athletes from women's sports teams and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  signed an executive order expanding access of IVF. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=99.16s)]
*  Remember the Democrats said, oh, he's going to take away IVF rights. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=102.08s)]
*  Well, no, he's expanding. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=104.88s)]
*  Makes it more affordable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=105.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  Changed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, just to name a few. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=107.56s)]
*  Right. That last one caught me by surprise. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=110.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=112.4s)]
*  But it's cool. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=113.4s)]
*  It's on that poster. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=113.92s)]
*  It's kind of cool. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=114.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=115.16s)]
*  I hate the pivot from the talking point, but that women, the men in women's sports, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=115.56s)]
*  I am surprised that that is still a story. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=120.8s)]
*  We saw it over the weekend where the new senator from Michigan, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=123.64s)]
*  Alyssa Slockin, who gave the speech, could not say that men should not be involved with it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=129.16s)]
*  The president is winning. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=135.48s)]
*  It's like an 80-20 issue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=136.36s)]
*  And she says, leave it up to the locals. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=138.28s)]
*  And he's dominating on that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=140.32s)]
*  I would say, as it relates to the two things that he's gaining more and more [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  traction from, it is what he did at the border and this issue alone. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=146.76s)]
*  There's still some stuff to fix with the economy, but those two issues have been winners. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=150.76s)]
*  Yeah, the whole tariff thing's got to be worked out, I think, a little bit steady overhand. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=154.28s)]
*  But the focus, I get it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=157.88s)]
*  Listen, we're going to start making things here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  I thought Sean Fain over the weekend, who runs a major union that spoke out at the DNC, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=161.12s)]
*  over the weekend, he said, I spoke with Trump's Dylan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=167.16s)]
*  And I go back to when Ross Perot sat on that stage with Al Gore, or had a debate on Larry [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  King with Al Gore, who was vice president at the time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=175.72s)]
*  And Al Gore said, I talked to five Nobel laureates. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=177.88s)]
*  I talked to every economist. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=180.2s)]
*  If you have NAFTA and these free trade, you're going to see millions of jobs come to America. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=181.32s)]
*  Ross Perot sat there, and he says, I remember being 23 years old. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=186.44s)]
*  I watched it, and he said, no, there's going to be a giant sucking sound of jobs leaving America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=190.04s)]
*  Mm-hm. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=193.88s)]
*  There was a job, that's all that happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  And it was underlined in the pandemic when it turns out we didn't make anything. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  We didn't make masks. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  We didn't make masks. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't make anything. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  So what President Trump is doing is saying, the incentives, the tariffs, I'm gradually [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=203.96s)]
*  changing the world to bring things back here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=209.6s)]
*  Could be short-term, it could be painful, but that's the major restructuring we're witnessing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=213.12s)]
*  And the workers appreciate it, if not immediately, eventually. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  It's long-term. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=222.44s)]
*  Well, the first 50 days have been incredible. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=223.44s)]
*  You saw that list. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  Those are just a few of the things that he's accomplished over the last 50 days. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  And everyone talks about the first 100 days. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=231.44s)]
*  And we know that the media is just ready, ready to pounce on Trump, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=233.2s)]
*  So there's an article in New York Times and some other networks saying that Elon Musk [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=236.88s)]
*  is clashing with the cabinet secretaries. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=241.32s)]
*  You know, they're going to have disagreements, probably, but Elon's providing the numbers [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=243.76s)]
*  saying from an economic standpoint, this is where we need to cut so that we can get our [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  debt lower. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=251.44s)]
*  And then the department heads are saying, hold on. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=252.76s)]
*  You know, we're listening to you, Elon. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=255.16s)]
*  We're trying to make cuts, but let us do it in our own terms. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=256.6s)]
*  So they're having these discussions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=259.68s)]
*  They had a cabinet meeting on Thursday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=261.16s)]
*  And then these headlines come out that Elon and Marco Rubio are clashing, that Marco Rubio [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=263.0s)]
*  said, 1,500 people took early retirement buyouts with the State Department. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=267.8s)]
*  That would count as layoffs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=272.24s)]
*  So we've already cut 1,500 jobs. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  And they're saying that those two were clashing in the meeting. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=275.96s)]
*  President Trump was asked about it over the weekend, and he said this is completely fake [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=278.52s)]
*  And he talked about how Doge has been able to work with his team. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=282.08s)]
*  This was Donald Trump on Air Force One yesterday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=285.16s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=287.6s)]
*  Well, I don't think the tensions are high. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=288.2s)]
*  Look, Elon's a very special person. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  And these cabinet people are special people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, these are very successful people or they wouldn't have gotten, you know, they've [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  attained the highest heights of government. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=299.08s)]
*  And they, I think they have fantastic relationship to Elon. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  And Doge has been incredible. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=307.24s)]
*  You know, hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and fraud and abuse has been found, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  already found. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=314.0s)]
*  And that doesn't mean they don't have a little bit of an argument here and there about something [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=315.48s)]
*  or maybe personnel arguments. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=320.0s)]
*  There's not too many contract arguments. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, contracts have been found. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  This is much more than just personnel. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraudulent contracts or very wasteful. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=328.72s)]
*  But I think fraud. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=335.04s)]
*  I think it's fraud. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  I think you're right, Ainsley, about the media waiting for something to cause division. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=337.8s)]
*  First of all, you got a cabinet that have, they all have strong personalities. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=342.8s)]
*  They're all successful in their right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=347.64s)]
*  And you have Elon Musk, who is the world's richest man, a smart guy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  They're going to disagree on some things and they're going to duke it out. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=352.76s)]
*  And I think for the media, they want to create a distraction for this administration. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=356.84s)]
*  I don't think it's going to work. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=361.56s)]
*  And I think the president is right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to allow the cabinet members to do what they need to do. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=364.64s)]
*  If they can't make the necessary cuts, then I'm going to send Elon in. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  Thanks to the leadership of Senator John Thune, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=373.32s)]
*  they got their cabinet secretaries in place in record time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=375.2s)]
*  They got it started. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=377.64s)]
*  Now the undersecretaries and the ambassador, especially in Israel. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  But it actually happened. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  There was an explosive meeting behind closed doors. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  Elon went after Marco Rubio directly. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=386.24s)]
*  Rubio took it, then fired back. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=388.84s)]
*  It also clashed with Sean Duffy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=390.96s)]
*  Sean's like, what are you doing in my department? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=392.88s)]
*  You can't cut air traffic controllers. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  And he said, I'm not. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  He goes, no, you're not. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  But your people are. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  Can't do that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=400.35999999999996s)]
*  This is, to me, as healthy as it gets. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=401.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump watched the whole thing by all reports. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=403.96s)]
*  Watched the whole thing going on and go, OK, enough. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  Here's what we're doing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  Cabinet secretaries will handle personnel. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=409.28s)]
*  But you have to check in every two weeks. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  And if you're not doing it, you're going to have to deal with Doge, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=413.28s)]
*  who's going to deal with me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=415.52s)]
*  So we have a system in place. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=416.67999999999995s)]
*  Anybody who goes through any moment in history, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  where you just want to open up a book and get a perspective on what [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=421.28s)]
*  Reagan did or Woodrow Wilson did, you'll find out about all these clashes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=423.76s)]
*  It doesn't mean either side is wrong. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=428.0s)]
*  It means different opinions about doing things with one objective, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  be making successful. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  And if you were an egomaniac doing it for the wrong reasons, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  those are the ones who are short-lived. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=437.52s)]
*  To me, I love the way this came out, because they all have the same objective. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=439.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=442.76s)]
*  It's the methods. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=443.23999999999995s)]
*  And then they're just going to go on to a different system. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=444.52s)]
*  Presidents show great leadership. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=447.4s)]
*  Let these guys fight it out in front of you, see their perspective. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=448.88s)]
*  And that's when you find out who's got the stronger argument, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  when you begin to melt. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=455.2s)]
*  Well, other cabinet secretaries didn't. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=456.56s)]
*  Elon and Marco Rubio were dining with the president together at Mar-a-Lago [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=458.64s)]
*  on Saturday. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  And Elon Musk is going to be on Larry Kudlow's show on Fox Business today [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=463.23999999999995s)]
*  at 4 PM. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=466.64s)]
*  I'm sure Larry will ask him about this, and we'll hear what he has to say. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=467.28s)]
*  Can I just say that I know this may be shocking to some, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  because the last four years, you had scripted cabinet meetings. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=474.2s)]
*  No mid-nothing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=477.72s)]
*  And then you had to submit your questions to the cabinet [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=479.16s)]
*  before everything was done with PowerPoint. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  We're back to doing business like it should be done. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  That means there's going to be some spirited debate [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=488.72s)]
*  with the leaders of the country. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=490.88000000000005s)]
*  I don't think Elon wants any sympathy, but it takes forever [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  to get through a Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  It's like three hours. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  But I got to the point yesterday when they were talking about the death [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  threats he's under. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=501.76000000000005s)]
*  So he says, not only did two people get captured going to get him, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  before he was even a Trump supporter, but he says, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=506.24s)]
*  since that time, the death threats are just flowing in. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=509.2s)]
*  And then you see in New York City, the Tesla showroom. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=511.92s)]
*  You're trying to sell a car for a living. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=514.36s)]
*  In New York City, probably a lucrative thing. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=516.0s)]
*  An electric car. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=518.8s)]
*  Chanting, we want clean air. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=520.04s)]
*  You idiots. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=522.4s)]
*  It's an electric car. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=523.4s)]
*  And then you go in and start being ripped out. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=524.8s)]
*  So now, I want to go buy a Tesla car, but I [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=526.88s)]
*  don't want to get involved in all that turmoil. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=531.96s)]
*  Europeans have stopped buying Teslas. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  The stock's taken a pounding. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  Please tell me how Elon's doing anything [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=540.64s)]
*  but trying to help the government. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uheo6xrFDUY&t=542.84s)]
