# Kennedy: These 'jackwagons' are being encouraged by Biden
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ)
*  Fox News alert more campus protests happening overnight across the country and you're looking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  at the protests in New Orleans as crews at Tulane University are clearing out what's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=7.08s)]
*  left of its pro-Palestinian encampment after the SWAT team moved in and quickly moved everybody [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=12.92s)]
*  out and now you can see what it was like inside there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=19.88s)]
*  They had to clean out three buildings at Tulane. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  They had them closed for two days but now they're open. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=26.36s)]
*  Alright, meanwhile back in Washington we are now learning that the White House is reportedly [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=29.16s)]
*  considering bringing certain Palestinians to the U.S. as refugees to offer them safe [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=35.56s)]
*  haven. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=41.4s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=42.4s)]
*  Here to react, Louisiana GOP Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=43.4s)]
*  Senator, I guess before we even comment on that, your reaction to where the White House [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=46.44s)]
*  has handled the pervasive unrest on college campuses. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=51.08s)]
*  Brian, it should not go unnoticed that President Biden has the ability to stop all of this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=59.72s)]
*  on a dime. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=67.64s)]
*  All he's got to do is call the college presidents and say look, if you don't get control of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=68.64s)]
*  your campuses I'm going to withhold your federal money. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=74.16s)]
*  Now the president hasn't done that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=78.08s)]
*  The moral of the story is you're never, I guess you're never too old to suck. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=81.94s)]
*  The reason he hasn't done that is because of politics. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=87.38s)]
*  CNN just came out with a poll. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  It said that 52% of likely voters in America will not vote for President Biden under any [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  Any circumstances. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=106.5s)]
*  They would vote for the guy who salts the fries at McDonald's before they would vote [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=110.64s)]
*  for President Biden. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  The White House knows this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=119.84s)]
*  So they're scared to alienate the not insubstantial Hamas wing of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=121.56s)]
*  That's what's behind a lot of this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=130.32s)]
*  The fries are delicious. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  They are good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying that guy's not qualified to be president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=134.92s)]
*  History shows anybody can do it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=142.28s)]
*  You know, Senator, we know the history of the Jewish people and all the persecution [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=143.76s)]
*  over thousands and thousands of years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=148.44s)]
*  Where are the people standing up for our Jewish friends? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=151.76s)]
*  That country, that's our ally. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  We have committed to helping them and helping their people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=158.27999999999997s)]
*  We're watching and listening to these interviews with Jewish students who can't even walk on [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=162.72s)]
*  their own campuses, have paid $70,000 a year to be able to get an education and they can't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=167.16s)]
*  even walk around and feel safe. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=172.16s)]
*  Well, I think most Republicans are standing up. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  Some Democrats are. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=179.92s)]
*  Many Democrats are scared to. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=181.04s)]
*  Because, let me say it again, there's a substantial Hamas wing of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=182.68s)]
*  And they believe in diversity, equity, inclusion, and the right to kill Jews. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=191.32s)]
*  And some of my Democratic colleagues, not all of them, but they're scared of them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=197.72s)]
*  Some universities are handling this well. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=204.84s)]
*  Tulane, Vanderbilt, University of Florida, they have good leadership. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=207.2s)]
*  I know their presidents. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=212.32s)]
*  Their presidents passionately support free speech. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=213.92s)]
*  But they know the Constitution doesn't protect disruptive behavior. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=218.0s)]
*  Well, Senator, you know, we haven't heard much from the president regarding this, but [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=222.56s)]
*  you know what they could do? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=227.2s)]
*  And you're on the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=228.92s)]
*  The Department of Justice should open an investigation into, you know, we've heard that the people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=231.88s)]
*  who took over the building here in New York, sounds like they were, for the most part, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=238.36s)]
*  all the leaders were outside agitators. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=242.96s)]
*  It sounds like there is some sort of a conspiracy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=245.28s)]
*  We had a former federal prosecutor on about two hours ago who said they could be charged [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=249.58s)]
*  with conspiracy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=254.16s)]
*  They could use RICO stuff. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=255.16s)]
*  We could figure out who is behind this and who's funding it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=256.66s)]
*  Well, I don't know about the conspiracy part, though I will say we probably need to get [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=261.08s)]
*  some new conspiracy theories because all the old ones turned out to be true. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=269.66s)]
*  I do know that President Biden could stop this on a dime. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=275.64s)]
*  All you've got to do is pick up the phone and quietly call the president of Columbia [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=279.96s)]
*  and say, listen, Madam President, I give you 14 days to get this straight or I'm going [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  to withhold all of your federal money. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=291.88s)]
*  And you would see the leadership at Columbia pounce on that like a ninja. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  They would get it straight. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=304.76s)]
*  Right, absolutely. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=306.32s)]
*  And then it would protect them from their crazy boards that don't want them to do anything, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=307.32s)]
*  Senator. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=312.44s)]
*  The problem is the faculty. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=313.44s)]
*  The problem in a lot of these places, not all, but many, it's the faculty. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=314.72s)]
*  We're seeing it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  They're sitting in the encampments. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they think. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=321.6s)]
*  The faculty members think they're right and they'll hurt you if you disagree with them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=323.0s)]
*  So Senator, I just got to get you to comment on the Palestinian situation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=328.12s)]
*  So you are you encouraged that we're going to start bringing in Palestinian refugees [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=331.0s)]
*  because we're I guess we're out of illegal aliens? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=334.48s)]
*  Well, number one, I think Congress is going to have something to say about that, Brian. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=338.32s)]
*  Number two, those refugees need to need to go to Egypt. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=342.52s)]
*  Now Egypt is there was just a big article in The Economist magazine. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=347.24s)]
*  Egypt will allow Palestinian refugees to come in as long as you pay five thousand dollars. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  OK, that's unacceptable. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=359.6s)]
*  We give billions of dollars to Egypt. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=363.68s)]
*  The IMF bails them out every other Thursday with our permission. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  President Biden needs to call Egypt and tell them to do their part. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=371.12s)]
*  But the problem is the Palestinians create unrest in every country they go into, including [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  Egypt, and they say we're not going to be that stupid again. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=377.8s)]
*  Well, what you allow is what will continue. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=380.8s)]
*  If you allow these these jack wagons on the college campuses to continue to do what they're [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=384.4s)]
*  doing, they're going to continue to do what they're doing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=390.88s)]
*  Duh. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=393.52s)]
*  What you allow is what will continue. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=394.52s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you very much for joining us live from the Russell Rotunda. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPRtIBORcQ&t=396.52s)]
