# Vivek Ramaswamy steps down from DOGE, leaving Elon Musk to lead dept
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk)
*  All right, Doe's co-founder Vivek Ramaswamy will no longer head the department, leaving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk as the sole chair. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=5.16s)]
*  Edward Lawrence joins us live from the White House with more. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=8.08s)]
*  Edward, what's the back story? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=10.72s)]
*  Yeah, so he's stepping away, possibly for future endeavors. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=12.72s)]
*  And I'll get to that in just a second. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=17.12s)]
*  Elon Musk was spotted here on the White House complex yesterday, and noticeably absent was [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  his Doe's duo brother, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=23.96s)]
*  Now, a Trump transition spokesperson says that Vivek has stepped away from the Department [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=26.68s)]
*  of Government Efficiency because he's possibly going to run for the governor of Ohio. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Now, on social media, Vivek says this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=36.12s)]
*  He says, quote, it was my honor to help support the creation of Doge. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=38.44s)]
*  I'm confident that Elon and the team will succeed in streamlining government. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  I'll have more to say soon about my future plans for Ohio. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Last night, when President Trump signed the executive order creating Doge, he was asked [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=51.04s)]
*  about the world's richest person getting an office in the West Wing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=55.24s)]
*  This is an order creating and implementing the Department of Government Efficiency known [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  as Doge. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  OK, that's a big one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=64.48s)]
*  Is Elon Musk going to get a West Wing office? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=65.48s)]
*  No, he's getting an office for about 20 people that we're hiring to make sure that these [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  get implemented. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=76.2s)]
*  So Doge now is off the ground and started running with those 20 folks that are here [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=78.88s)]
*  on the complex. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=83.84s)]
*  And we'll have to see what day two of the Trump administration has to offer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=84.84s)]
*  I can tell you that the lights are on in the residence right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  They were on when I got here at five thirty. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=93.56s)]
*  All right, Edward, thanks so much. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmTMU0NC8qk&t=96.0s)]
