# Dems accused of abandoning Black voters: 'We never see you' after elections
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E)
*  I'll tell you what, we win Virginia, we win the whole thing without question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=0.0s)]
*  Now it's very possible that without winning Virginia, we're going to win the whole thing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  too, but it'd be, wouldn't it be cool? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=17.72s)]
*  Wouldn't it be nice? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=20.12s)]
*  We got to do it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=21.94s)]
*  We're going to win Virginia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=23.0s)]
*  So we're two days out until election day. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=24.7s)]
*  Former president Donald Trump declared blue, leaning Virginia is still in play despite [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=27.06s)]
*  a new poll given vice president Kamala Harris a 10 point lead. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=31.7s)]
*  Our next guest says her state is ready for change. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=35.1s)]
*  Virginia Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears joins us now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=37.66s)]
*  Lieutenant Governor, thanks so much for giving us some time this morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=42.34s)]
*  Oh, thank you for having me, Lawrence. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  So Lieutenant Governor, tell us about Virginia. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=48.42s)]
*  We know back in 2022, we expected a big showing for the republic. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=50.66s)]
*  But it didn't necessarily happen. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=56.66s)]
*  Do you think this time will be different with Donald Trump being on the ballot? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=58.98s)]
*  Well, there's so much that's going to be different with Donald Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=63.779999999999994s)]
*  And it's just because I believe people are seeing that there are serious issues to be [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=68.1s)]
*  had. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=72.22s)]
*  And yeah, you can go on SNL and yuck it up, but so close to an election, I don't think [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=73.22s)]
*  so. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=77.1s)]
*  You ought to be making your major points. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=78.1s)]
*  For example, here in Virginia, as you mentioned, it's very important. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=79.46s)]
*  And I'm talking about what's happening over the seas. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=84.18s)]
*  Ninety five percent of all international communications is through undersea cables. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=86.18s)]
*  Furthermore, ninety five percent of commercial cargo goes through the seas. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=91.34s)]
*  Now, here in Virginia, we have the largest naval base in the world and our United States [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=96.5s)]
*  ships must be given free passage. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, we're not asking. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=104.18s)]
*  We're telling you, you're going to make this happen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=105.94000000000001s)]
*  So we need a president who understands this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=107.78s)]
*  And I believe Donald Trump does. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=110.86000000000001s)]
*  So Lieutenant Governor, when you look at this new coalition of Republicans or I should just [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=113.06s)]
*  say Trump voters, because it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to vote for another Republican. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=118.5s)]
*  But you see the support amongst black male. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=122.42s)]
*  And this polling is just incredible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=124.42s)]
*  Looking at it right now, you got 62 percent of black males voting for Harris, but 25 percent [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  voting for Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  Now, compare that to 2020. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden had 88 percent of black males and Trump had seven percent of black males. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=135.62s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think it's exciting what's happening. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Lawrence, people look like you and me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=147.94s)]
*  And immediately they would look at us and say, oh, they're Democrats automatically. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=152.54s)]
*  Lawrence, what kind of power do we have politically? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=156.66s)]
*  None. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=159.45999999999998s)]
*  They look at some other folks and they don't know who they are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  And so they've got to go and win them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=163.66s)]
*  They've got to go and make the case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=165.62s)]
*  And I tell you, we're finally saying no more. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=167.42s)]
*  No more are we going to be allowed to get the okie doke. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=170.06s)]
*  You know, you come and ask for our vote, Democrats, on Election Day, and we never see you again. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  And then you tell us, but vote for us, because, you know, we will help you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=178.26s)]
*  No, we want to know, what are your policies? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=181.94s)]
*  How are you going to make my life easier? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  Because for God's sake, life is hard enough. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=187.06s)]
*  And I tell you one thing that black men, black women, people all over know, even the Democrats [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  know, the minute you elect a Democrat, money is coming out of your pocket in some way, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=195.94s)]
*  shape or form. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  If they tax businesses, guess who's going to pay that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  You, the consumer. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=204.94s)]
*  I mean, Lieutenant Governor, you just hit on the issue that I've been hearing in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=205.94s)]
*  barbershops all across this country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  It's about the money. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=211.94s)]
*  And people are telling me that they have more money in their pocket under Donald Trump than [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=213.18s)]
*  they do right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=217.3s)]
*  And they just can't afford certain things. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=218.3s)]
*  So we'll see what happens on Election Day. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=219.82s)]
*  I'm going to be looking at the numbers very closely. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=222.18s)]
*  There is some rumor that you may be the next governor of Virginia as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  So we're going to be looking at your career as well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=228.26s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for giving us some time. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=230.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=233.54s)]
*  The only poll that matters is Election Day. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=234.54s)]
*  Get out and vote. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_scki5om2E&t=236.17999999999998s)]
