# Kamala Harris' 'cringy' moment on the campaign trail: 'Ouch'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE)
*  Meanwhile, both candidates hitting the battleground states hard in the final week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=0.0s)]
*  And with the Trump team, they're going beyond that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=3.64s)]
*  Their campaigns are looking to deliver a strong closing argument to the voters. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=6.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=10.88s)]
*  Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=13.24s)]
*  I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=16.92s)]
*  Love of our country to then fight for the ideals of our country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=20.84s)]
*  That's what our campaign is about. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=25.64s)]
*  But another cringey moment for Vice President Harris on the trail in Michigan yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=28.26s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  Now I want each of you to shout your own name. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  Do that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=42.22s)]
*  Because it's about all of us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=43.22s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=49.18000000000001s)]
*  Co-hosts of the five, you recognize them every day at five o'clock and then they go into [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=50.660000000000004s)]
*  the streets like normal human beings. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=54.22s)]
*  Al Ford, Jr. and Dana Perino, co-anchors of America's Newsroom. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=56.38s)]
*  Dana's got two jobs. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=59.82s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=60.82s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=61.82s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=62.82s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=63.82s)]
*  Dana, first off for you, the closing argument that you would put in the teleprompter for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  President Trump over the next seven days and for Kamala Harris. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=70.22s)]
*  Well, I think it's an interesting day. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=73.22s)]
*  You have President Trump going to a swing state in Pennsylvania talking about energy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  and the economy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=78.62s)]
*  And voters for the last, I don't know, is it 24 months have been saying that inflation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=79.94s)]
*  in the economy are the number one issues. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=84.5s)]
*  Energy also important there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=86.69999999999999s)]
*  Contrast that with a very DC centered campaign and a DC closing argument today talking about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=89.3s)]
*  January 6th and the past. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=94.86s)]
*  So during the conventions, I talked about the game of Jenga for each campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=96.41999999999999s)]
*  And at first it's very easy and you're pulling out the pieces and it's easy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=101.1s)]
*  Gets a little harder as you get closer. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  Now, I think Kamala Harris pulling out this piece is making her people very nervous because [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=106.1s)]
*  the super PAC that can't talk directly to her is sending up all these smoke signals [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=111.62s)]
*  saying the message about Trump being bad on democracy is not working for you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=115.5s)]
*  But she's about to place that piece on top of the pile. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=120.26s)]
*  Parole closing arguments. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=122.62s)]
*  We know at 10 o'clock President Trump is going to have a press conference in Palm Beach. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  A little bit later today, it's going to be Kamala Harris's closing argument at the ellipse. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  First, thanks for having me. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  I think Dana is largely right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=133.18s)]
*  I would be really positive. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=135.78s)]
*  America over the last three years has produced more energy, more innovation, more wealth, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=138.1s)]
*  more cures and therapeutics for things that afflict us. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=144.54s)]
*  And we have a country that more and more people want to come to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=147.74s)]
*  We've got to protect our borders, but we have something very special here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  How do you make it more affordable for every American? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=154.26s)]
*  How do you make this wealth thing work for every American and not just concentrated amongst [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=156.26s)]
*  a handful? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=160.74s)]
*  I think that's the challenge for her in these last few days. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  And if I were advising President Trump, I'd tell him to lay off some of the negativity [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=166.06s)]
*  as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=170.02s)]
*  The criticisms of Hispanics and others. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=171.02s)]
*  It's not necessary. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=172.98s)]
*  We are a great country and we need a president who can not only defend us and project our [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=174.38s)]
*  values but make it even greater for our kids. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=178.82s)]
*  That's what I'd be focused on. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=182.18s)]
*  I think it's critical of illegals, not Hispanics. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=183.18s)]
*  I don't think he's taking aim. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=185.62s)]
*  Well, there was a comment about Puerto Ricans as the only point I made. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=186.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=189.34s)]
*  That was a comedian. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=190.34s)]
*  Was that his? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=191.34s)]
*  But you understand my point. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=192.34s)]
*  It's different. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=193.34s)]
*  By the way, that's why you should be running for office. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=194.34s)]
*  The Harris people should be listening to you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=197.5s)]
*  That was great. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=198.86s)]
*  So you should put that right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=199.86s)]
*  You wrote it for me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=200.86s)]
*  No, it's fantastic. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=201.86s)]
*  I mean, how great are these guys? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPlab9kFJE&t=202.86s)]
