# Melania Trump reveals top priorities ahead of inauguration
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM)
*  So in one week, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 47th president of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=0.0s)]
*  We spoke with First Lady Melania Trump about what we can expect from her over the next [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=9.92s)]
*  four years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=14.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=15.16s)]
*  Madam First Lady, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=16.16s)]
*  Thank you for sitting down with us to talk about your new documentary. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=19.04s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=22.46s)]
*  It's an exciting time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=23.46s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  We were thrilled to hear that this was coming out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  I want to know details, why you decided to do this, and what will it be like? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=28.36s)]
*  Well, the book was such a success, and I'm very proud, and I get so many messages and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=33.84s)]
*  letters how they enjoy the book, and they would love my fans, and people would love [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=40.84s)]
*  to hear more from me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=46.32s)]
*  So I had an idea to make a movie, to make a film about my life. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=48.46s)]
*  My life is incredible. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=55.32s)]
*  It's incredibly busy, and I told my agent, you know, I have this idea, so please, you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  know, go out and make a deal for me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=64.56s)]
*  We started the production in November, and we are shooting right now, so it's a day-to-day [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=68.38s)]
*  life, what I'm doing, what kind of responsibilities I have. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=75.9s)]
*  People they don't really know, and they will see it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=82.8s)]
*  It's day-to-day from transition team to moving to the White House, packing, establishing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=85.9s)]
*  my team, the First Lady office, moving into the White House, what it takes to make the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=93.78s)]
*  residence your home, to hire the people that you need. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  So it's a snapshot of what it takes to move back into the White House. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  I don't think a First Lady has ever done this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Not that I know, of course. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=115.3s)]
*  Behind the scenes, what is it like when you're moving back in the White House? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=116.82s)]
*  What's different this time? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  The difference is I know where I will be going. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=122.3s)]
*  I know the rooms where we will be living. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=125.22s)]
*  I know the process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  The first time was challenging. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=129.82s)]
*  We didn't have much of the information. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=132.04s)]
*  The information was upheld for us from previous administration, but this time I have everything. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=134.94s)]
*  I have the plans. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=143.1s)]
*  I could move in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=144.38s)]
*  I already packed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=146.06s)]
*  I already selected the furniture that needs to go in. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  So it's very different transition this time, second time around. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=153.7s)]
*  Will you decorate it exactly like it was before, or are you making changes? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=158.26s)]
*  A little bit of changes, not much. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=161.74s)]
*  How have the Bidens been? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=164.1s)]
*  Have they been accommodating, and are they still living there? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  They're still living there, and they will be out on January 20. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=167.54s)]
*  So what happened is on January 20, the transition team has only five hours to move Bidens out [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=171.52s)]
*  and to move us in. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  So everything needs to be planned to the minute. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=181.72s)]
*  And when you were decorating the White House for Barron, I remember in the book you talked [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=184.94s)]
*  about how the Obamas, they had certain rooms that were pink for the girls, and you wanted [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=188.22s)]
*  to make them appropriate for Barron. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=193.62s)]
*  What is it like now? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, he'll have a bedroom there, but he's an adult. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  He's in college now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=201.52s)]
*  Will he be spending a lot of time there as well? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=202.52s)]
*  I think he will come and visit, yes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=205.0s)]
*  Will he bring his friends? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=206.96s)]
*  Is it fun? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=208.4s)]
*  Does he feel comfortable to bring friends? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=209.4s)]
*  Yeah, whatever he would like to do, yes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=210.4s)]
*  I feel that as a children, we have them till they are like 18, 19 years old. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=213.24s)]
*  We teach them, we guide them, and then we give them the wings to fly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  And I always respect Barron's yes and no and what he likes to do, where he would like to be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=228.04s)]
*  Do you feel like you're in a different space now than you were eight years ago? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=233.2s)]
*  I feel I was always me the first time as well. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=237.4s)]
*  I just feel that people didn't accept me, maybe. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=240.88s)]
*  They didn't understand me the way maybe they do now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=245.0s)]
*  And I didn't have much support. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=249.68s)]
*  Maybe some people, they see me as just the wife of the president, but I'm standing on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=252.92s)]
*  my own two feet independent. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  I have my own thoughts. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=260.36s)]
*  I have my own yes and no. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=261.84s)]
*  I don't always agree what my husband is saying or doing, and that's okay. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=264.32s)]
*  Are you able to tell him when you disagree? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=269.76s)]
*  I gave him my advice, and sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't, and that's okay. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=271.44s)]
*  And where will you be spending most of your time? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=277.0s)]
*  In the White House, Palm Beach, here in New York? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  I will be in the White House, and when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=281.92s)]
*  When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=286.36s)]
*  But my first priority is to be a mom, to be a first lady, to be a wife. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  And once we are in on January 20, you serve the country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=297.76s)]
*  First 100 days, what will that look like for you? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=303.0s)]
*  What are you looking forward to the most? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=305.36s)]
*  I established my team. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=307.32s)]
*  I have a few positions that I still need to hire. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=309.68s)]
*  I will not rush into that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=313.2s)]
*  I will see when I'm in the White House and what is needed. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=315.28s)]
*  I don't want to hire too many people on my team and spending too much taxpayer money. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=320.2s)]
*  I want to make sure that every position, they are talented, they have merit, they know what [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=326.32s)]
*  they're doing, and as well as they are team player. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=333.24s)]
*  They don't have their own agenda, so they serve me, they serve my office, and they serve [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=339.48s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=344.44s)]
*  And will you continue with your platform, Be Best? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=345.44s)]
*  I will continue with Be Best, and also I will expand Be Best. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  I started in the first administration. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=352.04s)]
*  I didn't have much support from anyone. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=356.04s)]
*  I invited all of the streaming platforms to the White House. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=359.88s)]
*  I had the roundtable, and I didn't have much support from them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=366.84s)]
*  And imagine what we could do in those years if they will rally behind me and teach the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=372.0s)]
*  children and do protect them about the social media and their mental health. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  How are you feeling about the busy schedule again, hitting the ground running on the 20th? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=387.08s)]
*  Very busy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=392.76s)]
*  We already started, and I think it will be an exciting four years. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=393.76s)]
*  We have a lot to do and put the country back in shape. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=400.12s)]
*  Wow, she looks ready to go. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=404.84s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=406.92s)]
*  She, I asked her if she could tell us a little bit about her wardrobe, what she will wear [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=408.48s)]
*  to the inauguration, what it will be like that night, what ball gown she'll wear. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=412.64s)]
*  She said you just have to stand by. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=416.96s)]
*  I said, will it be as beautiful as the blue dress, the Ralph Lauren blue dress with the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=418.92s)]
*  little coat and she wore the white gloves. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=423.36s)]
*  And she said that was a success. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=426.32s)]
*  She really does. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=428.2s)]
*  So interesting. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=430.32s)]
*  So cute. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=431.32s)]
*  So she seems excited about the next go around. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=432.32s)]
*  She's glowing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  She understands what type of staff that she needs. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  There's a little bit of a spark there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=441.24s)]
*  More confidence probably because she knows what to expect. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=443.12s)]
*  They've already done it for four years. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=445.72s)]
*  And we appreciate her sitting down with us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=448.72s)]
*  It's going to be this documentary. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=450.6s)]
*  I'm so excited to see it because it's behind the scenes of her walking through Trump Tower, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEExzc2JKM&t=451.96000000000004s)]
