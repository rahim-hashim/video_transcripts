*  Aliens have died across this border children die almost every day children get sexually assaulted [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  31% of women that make their journey get sexually assaulted and this administration been hiding it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  This is something we're going to dress [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=67.0s)]
*  We're going to show the American people exactly what we're doing on the border and why we need to do it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=68.32s)]
*  And this is one clean example why we need to secure that border [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=72.52s)]
*  So Tom there's other two-year-olds being held right now and and because in a rush to get them out [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=76.16s)]
*  People they're giving them to strangers who show up and say I'm the sponsor [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm the relative. How do you stop that? I mean, how what do you do with the children? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=85.28s)]
*  How do you stop the income in the incoming kids? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=90.4s)]
*  Well, first of all shame on the Biden administration and and Basara who's the secretary of HHS. He was on stage [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  About two months ago bragging how quick these children are released from government custody [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=100.88s)]
*  He thought you thought was a good thing where they're released because you're not properly vetting the sponsors [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=104.8s)]
*  They stopped the DNA testing shame on them [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=108.92s)]
*  That's why they have over [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=111.58s)]
*  300,000 children that they've released to unvetted sponsors that they can't find and President Trump is committed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=113.3s)]
*  In addition to securing the border and having a deportation operation is to find and locate these [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=119.62s)]
*  300,000 children because many of them are going to be enforced labor many of them enforced sex trade [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=125.1s)]
*  We need to save these children. How do we stop it? We secure the border [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=128.9s)]
*  We send a strong message the rest of the world if you cross this border legally, you're gonna be deported. You're gonna be detained [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=132.34s)]
*  You're not gonna be released children won't be delivered to the parents and to complete the criminal conspiracy banley smuggling [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=138.1s)]
*  We got to put a stop to it. So today you're gonna be at the board with Governor Abbott. What's the objective? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, we're not waiting to January 20th, we're already we're already planning what we're going to do to lock down the state of Texas [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=151.78s)]
*  Governor Abbott's in a great job. So far. Look [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=159.3s)]
*  illegal crossings in Texas is down over 80% because of great work by Governor Abbott and he's been successful because he's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=161.7s)]
*  He has taken the Trump policies and put him to work. He's put the border barriers and walls up walls work President Trump proved that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=168.06s)]
*  He has consequences. He's arresting people and charging them that cross the border [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=174.78s)]
*  Consequences work so in and it's in everybody he arrests every every illegal alien the troopers arrest is one less gotaway [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=179.34s)]
*  So we're leasing over being fingerprinted and and they're not a national security threat every ounce of fentanyl his trooper sees is less [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=186.52s)]
*  Overdose deaths in this country. So we're gonna build upon his success [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=193.78s)]
*  I guarantee you the Trump administration isn't going constantly sue him for trying to secure the border [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=196.64s)]
*  We're going partner up and help him do 100% security on his border and we're going to do that across the southwest border [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=202.04s)]
*  You are build they are building a wall in Texas [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=208.44s)]
*  They bought the land and they're building a wall. Is this wall gonna be up to your standard? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=211.16s)]
*  Is is that what these states have to do? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, look if you want to secure the border you got it you got a bullet border barriers [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=220.6s)]
*  We approve border barriers work. You also got it and catch and release [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=224.28s)]
*  We got to put the remaining Mexico program back in you got the third safe country agreements [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=227.8s)]
*  We got Congress needs to change the asylum laws, but I'm not counting that to happen [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=232.16s)]
*  So President Trump's not to come in with executive orders like he did the first time [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  President Trump was a game changer with remain in Mexico [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  He had the lowest illegal immigration over 45 years illegal grace down 90% and Brian the example is two-year-old when [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=243.22s)]
*  90% less people coming how many children aren't dying crossing that border? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=250.28s)]
*  How many children women ain't sexually assaulted? So look President Trump's policies work. We're going to do it again this time [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=254.04s)]
*  We're going to finish the job [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=259.08s)]
*  Tom, you know to do the job better than anybody [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=260.4s)]
*  But if we could see those stories and the only reason we saw it because the check just DPS said [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=262.88s)]
*  You know, we'll blur their faces hide the identity, but I want to show you what we're dealing with we can see those stories [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=268.28s)]
*  I think that people would understand really what you're up against [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=273.32s)]
*  Do you plan on doing it the three-year-old that comes across the the unaccompanied eight-year-old that comes across? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=277.02s)]
*  As tragic and as sad as those things are we have to show the American people we got to be transparent and show the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=283.96s)]
*  American people why we need to secure the border. It's about saving lives bottom line [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=290.88s)]

*  holding dead children talking to girls as young as nine that were raped multiple times and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=300.68s)]
*  I've said it before everything innocent and pure within that little girl work was ripped from her and she would never be the same [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS_8_sxfzyg&t=305.2s)]
