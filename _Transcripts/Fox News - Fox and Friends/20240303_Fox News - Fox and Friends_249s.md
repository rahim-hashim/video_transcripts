# Israeli gov’t spokesman reveals if a Gaza cease-fire is on the horizon
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. The Biden administration confirms that they say that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel has agreed to the framework of a proposed Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. And [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=4.92s)]
*  it's now up to Hamas to agree to it. This comes as Biden approves the first U.S. military [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=11.28s)]
*  airdrop of food and supplies into the Gaza Strip. Here with reaction, Israeli government [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=17.6s)]
*  spokesman Elan Levy. Elan, thanks for being here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=23.64s)]
*  Good morning. Thank you for having me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of this report? Is there a ceasefire on the horizon? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=28.32s)]
*  Well, there's not going to be a ceasefire that leaves the hostages in Gaza or Hamas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=32.52s)]
*  in power. But what we do want to see is a temporary pause in the fighting to get those [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=36.76s)]
*  poor hostages out. We're talking about 134 people who have been trapped in the Hamas [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=41.68s)]
*  terror dungeons for 149 days now. It's too late for 33 of them. They've already been [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=47.36s)]
*  killed in captivity. And we want to see a pause in the fighting to help get those poor [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=53.56s)]
*  hostages back to their families. How many of those hostages would you get for that pause? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=58.32s)]
*  And what kind of a pause are you talking about? I can't confirm any details until everything [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  is confirmed. Obviously, we want to get all of the hostages out and are doing everything [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=67.48s)]
*  we can. That is why Israel is continuing to place unrelenting military pressure on Hamas [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=72.04s)]
*  to release the hostages. That's how we got the last 105 hostages out during the temporary [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=77.6s)]
*  pause in November. And we want another pause to get all the others out, too. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=83.16s)]
*  How is the military operation going for viewers here that sort of see snippets? We also watched [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=87.64s)]
*  the hair on fire criticism of the left and the international community. But from Israel's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=94.2s)]
*  perspective as far as eradicating Hamas, how is it going? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, people said there was no military solution and the military campaign has been exceeding [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=101.44s)]
*  expectations. Hamas started this war with 24 battalions and essentially only the last [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=105.28s)]
*  four in Rafah are still standing. We've managed to shatter Hamas' military formations, destroy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=111.16s)]
*  its missile production capability. That's why in Tel Aviv we basically haven't heard [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=116.44s)]
*  a rocket siren in two months already. We're continuing to move in on the Hamas terror [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=120.92s)]
*  army to bring it to justice for 10-7 and more importantly to make sure that it can never [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=126.36s)]
*  perpetrate those atrocities again and again as it is threatening to do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=131.32s)]
*  How do you feel about aid being dropped by the U.S.? Is there any, when you drop it that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=135.6s)]
*  way, is there any way to control whether it goes to the civilian population or whether [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=141.44s)]
*  Hamas takes it and leverages it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=145.12s)]
*  Well, this is a way to try to get aid to civilians and make sure Hamas can't steal it. We have [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=146.88s)]
*  enough capacity at Israel's crossings to get more aid into Gaza. The question is how do [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=151.72s)]
*  you get it to civilians who need it while making sure Hamas can't steal it? And to date [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=156.64s)]
*  Hamas has been stealing aid and the United Nations has been covering it up. So the airdrops [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=162.16s)]
*  are one way that we are looking into getting aid straight to civilians who need it while [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  making sure that the terror organization that started this war, that has brought ruin to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=170.68s)]
*  the people of Gaza by starting the 10-7 atrocities and triggering this war, that the people can [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=175.6s)]
*  get the aid and the terrorists can't get their hands on it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=181.12s)]
*  Is the U.S. putting too much pressure on at this point from the outside? Is there a sense [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=183.96s)]
*  in Israel that from the Prime Minister on down, you can't conduct the war you want to? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=188.2s)]
*  You know, President Biden said right at the beginning of this war that if the 10-7 atrocities [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=193.44s)]
*  had happened to the United States, its response would be swift, decisive and overwhelming. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=197.64s)]
*  And that's what we're doing and we've had firm moral, military, diplomatic support, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  not only from the administration, a bipartisan basis, most importantly from the American [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  people as well. The big Harvard-Harris poll this week showing 82 percent of Americans [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=210.98s)]
*  support Israel over Hamas. We have a problem with the universities on the campuses, as [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=216.2s)]
*  you'll be aware of, but we know that the American people stand firmly behind Israel as we fight [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=220.48s)]
*  to bring those poor hostages home and Hamas to justice. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, you're certainly right about the American people. You're right about the universities. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  And I know you can't say it about the White House, but hopefully they stay strong. We'll [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=230.76s)]
*  see if they do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=235.48s)]
*  Ailan, thank you very much for your time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cDyCP8lAY&t=236.48s)]
