# Democrats are trying to do this ‘under the radar,’ GOP rep warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4)
*  Rob Kaufman joins us now. Rob, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning Will. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=3.0s)]
*  So you've got this school, we've seen the pictures of the building by the way, beautiful [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=4.0s)]
*  school, 1895 I believe it was built. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=7.36s)]
*  And tell me about the plans they tried to put in place to bring in migrants to shelter [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=10.16s)]
*  in the school. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so there was a plan by an LLC who came and approached our local government. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=15.68s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, land use is a municipal issue. So our municipal leaders were approached [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=24.96s)]
*  by this LLC that appears to work with the federal government. And they intended to house [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=32.68s)]
*  hundreds of migrants, termed in the letter refugees, in these old buildings. It's a campus [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  150 acres and 70 buildings right in the middle of our community, our township, and really [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=49.12s)]
*  something that has historical significance as well. And so fortunately our township supervisors [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=58.8s)]
*  have handled it well to this point. And they have said it's not permitted in our zoning [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  and our land use. But this is the kind of thing they would like to do it under the radar. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=69.28s)]
*  But this time we found out about it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=75.08s)]
*  Let's put it into context. How big is your town, this township, this rural area of Pennsylvania? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=78.04s)]
*  So the township that this would be sited in is about 18,000 people. The overarching [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=83.64s)]
*  area called Chambersburg, which includes about four municipalities and a few more, is about [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  70,000 people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  Okay. Either way, small community, 18 or 70,000. And then hundreds of migrants, any idea where [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  they would have come from? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=103.68s)]
*  No, it was very vague. We're still learning more information, getting more information [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=106.44s)]
*  from folks on the federal level. We've been working closely with Congressman John Joyce, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=113.88s)]
*  who is our representative in Washington, D.C., just trying to figure out what happens in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=118.84s)]
*  these scenarios. So we have very few details, which I think is what they like. That's what [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=123.56s)]
*  they would like to do. Towns don't find out about it until they're embroiled. Usually [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=129.68s)]
*  in the controversy and the mess that it's created. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=136.0s)]
*  And then let's talk about really quickly the logistics of how this happens. I know you [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  said it's an LLC and it was in partnership, which is a form of a corporation. I'm assuming [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=144.28s)]
*  it's some type of nonprofit, in partnership with the federal government to bring these [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  in and no real, I can tell no real details. And I would assume no coordination with the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=155.24s)]
*  local community? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=160.4s)]
*  Correct. Yes, there was very little communication or any coordination, simply a vague request [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=162.4s)]
*  from this LLC. I believe it was USA Upstar, something of that nature. And, you know, it [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=171.0s)]
*  was owned, it is owned by another LLC that we don't know or believe there's any affiliation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=180.36s)]
*  But it's something that communities need to be hyper aware of in this environment across [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=188.6s)]
*  our country. Because if you don't want to end up like Springfield, Ohio, or, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=194.88s)]
*  Aurora, Colorado, or a place like that, you've got to be vigilant in protecting what you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=200.04s)]
*  have in your communities across this land. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=205.72s)]
*  And I think that's, yeah, that's the overarching point is it whether or not it's your township [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=207.92s)]
*  or Springfield, Ohio, this is happening and can happen in small towns all across America, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=212.48s)]
*  who ought to have a say in their own community. We appreciate you being with us this morning [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=218.0s)]
*  and helping us understand this issue. Thank you so much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=222.64s)]
*  Thank you, Will. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=225.68s)]
*  All right, by the way, Fox and Friends reached out to the organization working to turn the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=226.68s)]
*  school into a shelter and we have not heard back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTFCWT-Ml-4&t=229.28s)]
