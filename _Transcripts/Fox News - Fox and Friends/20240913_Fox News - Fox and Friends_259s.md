# Jack Keane: This is getting more and more dangerous
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI)
*  Meanwhile, Russia and China holding the largest military drills this week in the largest in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=0.0s)]
*  30 years. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=4.68s)]
*  The war games included 90,000 troops, 400 warships, 120 planes and helicopters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=5.92s)]
*  This comes as the US, UK, France and Germany sanction Iran for supplying missiles to Russia. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=11.28s)]
*  But they're doing it anyway. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=16.16s)]
*  Retired four-star general, Fox News' senior strategic analyst, General Jack Keane. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=17.56s)]
*  General, first off, your reaction to the war games. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=21.72s)]
*  What's your takeaway? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=24.92s)]
*  Well, that's a dramatically large war game, to say the least, given the amount of ships [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=26.12s)]
*  involved. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=30.96s)]
*  Arctic and Pacific Oceans, Mediterranean, Baltic Sea and the Caspian Sea, all involved [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=31.96s)]
*  in that exercise. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=39.0s)]
*  Listen, so our audience understands the most significant geopolitical change in the world [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=40.0s)]
*  in the last three or four years is the cooperation of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  The degree that they cooperate and collaborate together and coordinate together, and you [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=51.76s)]
*  can see this happening here, it creates a dangerous situation globally. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=56.68s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Because if China started a war in the Indo-Pacific region over the South China Sea or Taiwan, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  it's likely that Russia would do much the same because they know the United States could [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=68.52s)]
*  not handle two and we would find ourselves in a global conflict. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=72.24s)]
*  That is the danger that is out there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  I was on a congressional commission for 20 months and that was the major conclusion that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  we made in terms of the seriousness and the danger that it's facing the United States [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=84.36000000000001s)]
*  and our allies going forward. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, even though Russia would certainly be the junior partner by a lot. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=90.56s)]
*  A joint statement, now let's talk about Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=93.76s)]
*  We know they're supplying ballistic missiles directly to Russia to continue that war, and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=96.12s)]
*  this is our joint statement back to them as we decide to sanction them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=101.12s)]
*  This is a further escalation of Iran's military support to Russia's war of aggression against [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=104.72s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=108.68s)]
*  They will be taking immediate steps to cancel bilateral air service agreements with Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=109.72000000000001s)]
*  Does that matter? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=113.64s)]
*  Not much. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=114.64s)]
*  I mean, this is mostly symbolism. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=115.64s)]
*  I think what's really happening that's a good thing as a result of the, this is about 200 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  missiles, ballistic missiles, short range, 75 miles. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  It's not thousands of missiles, it's a couple of hundred and likely more to follow. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=129.32s)]
*  In of itself, it's not military decisive. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=134.36s)]
*  The good news here is the Brits have already made a decision, they haven't publicly announced [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=137.76s)]
*  it that they are going to remove the restrictions on Ukraine using their Storm Shadow cruise [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=142.48s)]
*  missiles. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=149.24s)]
*  And it looks like the United States is moving in the same direction to remove the restrictions [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=150.24s)]
*  imposed on the Atacams. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=155.0s)]
*  That will make a big difference for the Ukrainians being able to fire at military bases, Russian [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=157.28s)]
*  military bases inside of Russia, which is most people think is self-evident and is something [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=163.04s)]
*  that should take place. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=168.44s)]
*  But those restrictions have really harmed the Ukrainians. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=169.92s)]
*  So already, Russia has expelled the UK diplomat, the headline is UK diplomats as Putin warns [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=172.84s)]
*  of Ukraine's decision on the Western weapons used by Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=180.32s)]
*  And they say that if we release the restrictions, they can, he considers us at war with NATO. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  What do you think of Vladimir Putin's rhetoric? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=189.44s)]
*  Well, I think his rhetoric has been pretty consistent for two years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=192.0s)]
*  He's been threatening escalation, but it has never happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=195.52s)]
*  When we provided one more advanced weapon after another, and this time when we move [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=199.8s)]
*  restrictions, nothing has happened consequentially as a result of it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=205.08s)]
*  Putin's got his hands full here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=209.88s)]
*  He's got the Ukrainian military inside his territory, and he's making some progress with [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=211.8s)]
*  his major counteroffensive, but it's not making the kind of exploitation progress he wanted [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=218.04s)]
*  to take significant amount of territory back. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=224.12s)]
*  So there are real issues for him on his side as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=227.52s)]
*  And now for the first time ever, he's waving a flag that he may be willing to talk. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=231.28s)]
*  We'll see if that becomes a reality or not. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=235.64s)]
*  And this will be a big consequence of the election because President Trump wants to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=238.32s)]
*  get all sides together and stop it immediately. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=241.84s)]
*  General Jack Keane, thanks so much. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=244.72s)]
*  Yeah, have a great weekend, guys. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooelA7cUGWI&t=246.12s)]
