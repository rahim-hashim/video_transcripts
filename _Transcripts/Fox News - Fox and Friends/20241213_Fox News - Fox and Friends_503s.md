# 'DOMINO EFFECT': Tom Homan hints at more meetings with blue-city mayors
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4)
*  Met with President-elect Trump's incoming border czar Tom Homan pictured screen left right there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=0.0s)]
*  The Democrat mayor's screen right says he and Homan share a common goal in the migrant crisis [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=6.2s)]
*  We're not going to be a safe haven for those who commit repeated violent crimes [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=14.4s)]
*  Against innocent migrants immigrants and long-standing New Yorkers. That was my conversation today [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=20.2s)]
*  With the borders are to figure out how do we go after those individuals? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=27.0s)]
*  Who are repeatedly committing crimes in our city? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=32.12s)]
*  Now there we go incoming borders are Tom Homan had that meeting hours ago [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=36.8s)]
*  And he's here to talk about a time you said some really promising things you were [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=40.6s)]
*  Mayor Eric Adams has led you to believe that he's in to help you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely, I've been calling mayor Adams over two years saying he forgot what it's like being a cop became a politician [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=49.08s)]
*  Because he wasn't taking up action on public safety in the city when it comes to illegal aliens [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=54.440000000000005s)]
*  Yesterday I saw a complete 180. I saw the cop and him and he is he is he has promised to work with us to target [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Violent criminal illegal aliens in this city and to help us find over 300,000 missing children that this administration released unbetted sponsors [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=68.28s)]
*  That struck a chord with muscle. So he's promised partnership [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=75.88s)]
*  He promised that he's going to write some EOS to get some of the stuff done and overturn some damage that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=78.84s)]
*  Blasio did we're talking about getting back into Rikers Island where we used to have agents so people get released [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=84.0s)]
*  We're talking about having agents assigned in the precincts rather than releasing straight to the street on this bill reform law [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=89.36s)]
*  Give it to my agents to take care of so we promised to put our two staffs together and work out the details [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  But as of yesterday, he's all in Tom. What made him change I [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=100.56s)]
*  Think I think the tragedies we've seen the last year or two I think you know whether it's no [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=103.84s)]
*  Lake and Raleigh and we actually talked about Lake and Raleigh yesterday because Lake and Raleigh was arrested in the city [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  If we would had a better like operation killer [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=116.76s)]
*  Or killer we had a better relationship here. He would never got to Georgia, right and she'd probably like today [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  So we talked about that. So like I said yesterday [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=125.64s)]
*  I saw [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=127.96s)]
*  Eric Adams a career cop and he really cares about public safety of the city [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  He didn't want somebody can and he's willing to take the hits from the left to do it because he's right thing to do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=133.18s)]
*  He's putting public safety over politics and I thought yesterday was a great time [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=137.56s)]
*  That should be every city because I don't know if people understand this but when there's a detainer we're talking about criminals only [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=141.44s)]
*  This is only criminals. If you're asking low local law enforcement for help [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  It's because someone has broke the law in some way [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  We're not talking about although that is a part of deportation [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=155.26s)]
*  But your cooperation for every major city is only talking about the criminal aliens, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=159.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we talked about yesterday. I said look I don't I'm not looking for NYPD become immigration officers [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=164.94s)]
*  No, you know leave that to me [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  But when it comes to public safety threats, we should be on the same side and that's why I get so angry [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=171.94s)]
*  Just Chicago mayor, you know governor Pritzker and San Diego just passed the most [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  damaging [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=181.5s)]
*  Laws in San Diego that illegal alien can get arrested for rape and they're gonna release them to the street rather than call ice [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=183.18s)]
*  so and that's why I'm so angry because I don't I don't think it's a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=189.3s)]
*  Part issue it be a it should be a partisan issue [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=192.38s)]
*  Republicans Democrats and depends when it comes to public safety [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  What what elected mayor or elected governor doesn't want public safety threats other communities? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=197.9s)]
*  So that's what angers me but yesterday's meeting was a good meeting and I even gave him credit because once he agreed to sit down [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=203.18s)]
*  I'm not gonna give their names yet [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  But two other mayors have reached out until I verify they're gonna get to the table with me already reached out [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=211.1s)]
*  So I think this starts a domino effect. Well, he did [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=215.72s)]
*  Yes, sir. Okay. I got a feeling it was not the mayor of Chicago because you just mentioned mayor Johnson [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=219.62s)]
*  I know you were in [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Chicago on Monday and you said that your deportation plan is gonna start in a big way in Chicago [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=227.7s)]
*  And you said the the governor and the mayor can either help you or get out of the way [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=233.34s)]
*  but you also said if he [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=238.42s)]
*  Meaning the mayor if he impedes us if he knowingly harbors or conceals an illegal alien [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=241.1s)]
*  I will prosecute him. So you will not only go after the illegal migrants [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=246.89999999999998s)]
*  You may go after some mayors who aren't helping if they step over that line [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=253.0s)]
*  They can sit back and watch us which I again I find incredible [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=258.02s)]
*  You don't want to take public safety threats out of community help us [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=261.46s)]
*  But there are laws on the books that we will we will prosecute it's it's 18 USC 111 [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=264.26s)]
*  Impeding a federal law law enforcement officers a felony [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=271.24s)]
*  title eight United States cold 1324 triple-i if [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  You knowingly conceal or harbor and they're going alien from ice that is a felony when I was an agent long time ago [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  I've arrested you as citizens for harboring an alien their home or place of employment if I can do it to a citizen [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=284.32s)]
*  Why can't I do it to a politician who's going? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=290.18s)]
*  Actively getting our way prevent us from doing our job. Yeah, so talk about up close and personal real story yesterday [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=293.22s)]
*  We found out about a seven-year-old ivory Smith who was killed by an illegal immigrant [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=299.26s)]
*  Who was arrested let go and was drunk driving killed dead. This is the type of thing that motivates you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=304.38s)]
*  Yes [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=310.98s)]
*  Throughout my career. I've seen a lot of trash as we talked about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=312.9s)]
*  Many tragic back with Tractor trailer and 19 dead people at my feet including five-year-old boy suffocated to death [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=315.7s)]
*  I thought the girls as young as nine years old that were raped multiple times by the criminal cartels and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=321.3s)]
*  Once you sit through a little we talked a little nine-year-old girl and that went to that sort of hell it changes who we are [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  So yeah, I'm very passionate. This is just in about it is just about illegal immigration [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2aPpq71x4&t=334.22s)]
