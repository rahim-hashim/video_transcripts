# This is the moment of Israel's greatest vulnerability: KT McFarland
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM)
*  Katie McFarland, she serves as deputy national security advisor under President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=4.62s)]
*  Katie, your reaction to the deal, there's this is really extortion. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=5.62s)]
*  Yeah, of course it's extortion. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=11.28s)]
*  And this is the moment of greatest vulnerability for Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=15.52s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=18.36s)]
*  You know, Hamas knows that they cannot defeat Israel on the battlefield or on the economic [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=19.36s)]
*  playing field. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=24.84s)]
*  Hamas's only chance to destroy Israel is in the public relations field diplomatically. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=26.04s)]
*  And so what's going to happen next is Hamas will release those first tranche of prisoners, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=32.04s)]
*  then there'll be the second tranche of them. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=37.2s)]
*  And then Israel is going to release, by the way, what Israel is releasing are not hostages. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=39.16s)]
*  They're terrorists who have been condemned and had been lawfully put in jail. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=43.84s)]
*  So it's not an equivalent right there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  But what will happen is after this first batch of 50 Israelis, women and children and babies [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=50.34s)]
*  are released, then there'll be a pressure within Israel, but also in the world of, well, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=56.78s)]
*  let's get more of those hostages. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=61.82000000000001s)]
*  Let's get more of those Israelis, little babies home to their parents and to their grandparents. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  And the worry is that Israel is then going to be pressured to stop. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=68.7s)]
*  Israel knows it has to defeat Hamas completely. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=73.78s)]
*  It has to destroy its political and military leadership and its ammunition dumps. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=76.62s)]
*  And if Israel's not allowed to do that, this problem just comes back again and again and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=81.26s)]
*  again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=86.06s)]
*  And the world public opinion is changing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=87.06s)]
*  And KT, the other thing they could do is start marshaling the intelligence to start getting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  some rescues. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=94.2s)]
*  And the rescues are another reason to get to have offensive operations. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  What do you think the pressure is like on Joe Biden being that his party is fracturing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=101.28s)]
*  under his feet? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=105.94s)]
*  Well, you know, the problem that Joe Biden's got, and I'm surprised that Biden has stayed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=109.94s)]
*  as loyal to Israel as he has so far. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=114.3s)]
*  He is sharing intelligence, American intelligence with Israel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=117.06s)]
*  He is backstopping Israel with military supplies. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=119.5s)]
*  He has given them diplomatic cover. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=122.04s)]
*  He's visited Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=123.82s)]
*  But the pressure within his own party, especially as his own political fortunes are falling [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=125.3s)]
*  apart, is that he's going to have to appeal to the base of his party. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=130.34s)]
*  And the base of his party is anti-Semitic, is anti-Israel, doesn't want any more aid [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=133.66s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=137.5s)]
*  And it feels that there's an equivalence, that the Palestinians are just as bad as the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=138.74s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=143.18s)]
*  And so in fact, it's a lot of cases, they think it's Israel's fault. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=144.18s)]
*  So the political pressure on President Biden in the coming days will be immense. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=146.7s)]
*  And the world has already turned against Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=151.46s)]
*  You know, the European demonstrations, Europeans aren't backing the Israelis anymore. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=154.1s)]
*  The Asians, China, they never back the Israelis. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=157.98s)]
*  So the Israelis not only are not being backed, they could be backed into a corner. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=160.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=164.22s)]
*  But the right thing to do is stay with them, obviously. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=165.22s)]
*  KT McFarland, thanks so much. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh2hKSGw2jM&t=166.9s)]
