# MIDDLE-CLASS BOOM: Economist lays out Trump's plan to lower taxes
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk)
*  Former President Trump laying out his plan to get jobs back to America through the quote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=0.0s)]
*  art of the tariff. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=5.68s)]
*  If you put tariffs on those companies, you wouldn't have them leaving our country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=8.24s)]
*  They're leaving us going to Mexico right across the border, building a plant and selling things [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=12.64s)]
*  back into our country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=17.68s)]
*  You can't let them do that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=19.52s)]
*  That's what tariffs are for. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=20.6s)]
*  You put tariffs on, they won't be doing that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=22.02s)]
*  And it's like not complicated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=25.16s)]
*  It's really simple. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=26.96s)]
*  So how does that work and what does it mean for your wallet? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=29.52s)]
*  Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore joins us now to break it all down. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=31.68s)]
*  Stephen, I'm glad to have you on the show this morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=34.88s)]
*  Found this interview with Larry Kudlow fascinating from President Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=36.92s)]
*  Let's talk about tariffs. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=40.4s)]
*  There are those that say, wow, that's a way that you create more inflation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  That's the way you create economic adversaries. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=47.54s)]
*  You restrict supply coming in, cheap supply, for example, from China. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=50.84s)]
*  Tell me what would happen if we started to embrace the tariff. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=54.84s)]
*  Well, let's go back to when Trump was president. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  He was president for four years, Will, and he had an amazing record. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=63.2s)]
*  By the way, this new book out just came out called the Trump Economic Miracle. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=66.76s)]
*  I want everybody to get this because it lays out the case of what Trump did when he was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=70.64s)]
*  president and the boom for the middle class and the very workers that Trump is talking [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  about. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  By the way, the average family, Will, when Trump was president saw a $5,500 real gain [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=81.0s)]
*  in their incomes, and that was true of virtually every single racial group under Biden and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  Harris so far. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=94.41999999999999s)]
*  The average family has actually lost income, so they're poor today. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=95.82s)]
*  And one of the reasons for that is because a lot of these countries are stealing jobs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=100.32s)]
*  We're not creating jobs in the areas that we want. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=104.94s)]
*  In fact, it's been government jobs that have been leading the way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=107.6s)]
*  We want fewer government jobs. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  We want more jobs so people are making things here in America. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  And Trump is committed to that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  And incidentally, I'm a free trade guy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=117.08s)]
*  I do believe in free trade, but I saw it firsthand, Will, in Trump's first, in his first term, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=119.16s)]
*  that he used terrorists very strategically to get other countries to do things that are [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  in America's national security and economic security interests. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=132.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, we got a pansy in the White House today that refuses to stand up to these other [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=135.6s)]
*  countries. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=139.72s)]
*  So, I want to understand that because, like yourself, Stephen, much of the right has been [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=140.72s)]
*  for decades pure free trade, that it creates cheaper, better consumer products. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=145.64s)]
*  I don't know about better, but cheaper consumer products for Americans. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=150.88s)]
*  But you talked about strategic targeted tariffs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=155.1s)]
*  So give me an example of that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=158.28s)]
*  How would that be used in a way to bring jobs back on shore here in America without [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=160.48s)]
*  raising prices of goods? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, let's take the biggest adversary of the United States, a country that cheats and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=167.88s)]
*  steals and is an economic threat to the United States. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=173.12s)]
*  And that is, of course, China. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  And they're the biggest, you know, by the way, Mexico is our biggest trading partner, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=178.32s)]
*  but China is our second largest one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  And they are taking advantage of the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=186.28s)]
*  Because Trump would say they're laughing behind our back. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=188.44s)]
*  I saw firsthand so many times, I'll give you just one example, with the Europeans. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=191.16s)]
*  Remember, the Europeans would not pay their NATO dues. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=196.12s)]
*  Remember that, Will? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=199.4s)]
*  They refused to pay what they had promised. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=200.4s)]
*  And Trump went to them and said, look, if you're not going to pay your NATO dues, I'm [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=202.44s)]
*  going to slap you with a 30 percent tariff. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=207.12s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=209.4s)]
*  They paid up. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=210.4s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=211.4s)]
*  I saw it in Mexico, where the Mexicans told Trump, well, we're not going to help on the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=212.4s)]
*  border situation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  And Trump said, if you don't help, we're going to hit you with a 40 percent tariff. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=217.22s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=220.66s)]
*  They did it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=221.66s)]
*  So he uses this is a guy who puts America first. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=222.66s)]
*  And he puts American workers first. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=225.5s)]
*  I guarantee you when he wins, we're going to get those jobs back in the United States [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=227.62s)]
*  and they're high paying jobs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=231.7s)]
*  We're not going to see Americans losing income like they have under Biden. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=233.34s)]
*  So it just seems to me in the end, Stephen, that it's less about, you know, the theoretical [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=236.38s)]
*  academic debate of a broad spread embrace of free trade or a broad spread embrace of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=240.26s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=245.02s)]
*  We're looking for asymmetric relationships, asymmetric scenarios and using the tariff [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=246.02s)]
*  to bring back a balance of strategic interest to the United States in those unfair circumstances, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=251.06s)]
*  China or as you point out with the NATO. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=256.46000000000004s)]
*  I got to leave it there, Stephen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=258.3s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=259.3s)]
*  I'm tight on time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=260.3s)]
*  But it's important conversation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=261.3s)]
*  I appreciate you helping enlighten it this morning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=262.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qS2UHkLHsk&t=264.06s)]
