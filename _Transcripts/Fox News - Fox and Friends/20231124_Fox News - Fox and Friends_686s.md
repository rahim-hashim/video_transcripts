# Trey Yingst: This is the reality of the Israel-Hamas hostage deal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI)
*  All right, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=0.0s)]
*  We begin this hour with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=3.92s)]
*  This is a live look at the Offer Prison, where Palestinian prisoners are expected to be released [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=5.78s)]
*  in about two hours from now as part of Israel's hostage swap with Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=12.0s)]
*  They give them prisoners. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=18.36s)]
*  They get back innocent people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=19.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Israel, officials are preparing for the return of 13 hostages. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=21.36s)]
*  They're of the first of 50 to be released over the next four days. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=28.44s)]
*  Trey Yankst is live at the Israeli air base, where the exchange is set to take place. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=31.6s)]
*  Take it away, Trey. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=36.52s)]
*  Hey, guys. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=38.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=39.8s)]
*  Just two hours from now, that first group of hostages is expected to be released into [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=40.8s)]
*  the hands of the Red Cross, and then they will be flown to this military base, the Hatzarim [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=44.84s)]
*  base in southern Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  They'll be evaluated and then ultimately able to call their loved ones. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=51.52s)]
*  We were watching earlier today as military ambulances made their way into the base. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=55.16s)]
*  After that initial evaluation, they will go to regional medical facilities, one of five [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=60.419999999999995s)]
*  different hospitals, where they will be hospitalized in separate secluded wards. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  Now, remember, this first group consists of 13 people, all women and children. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=70.16s)]
*  The IDF has been working to make sure they have blankets and headphones, all sorts of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=75.16s)]
*  supplies that they'll need when they return safely here to Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=79.22s)]
*  They are reportedly from the same area of southern Israel, and they will be exchanged [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=83.08s)]
*  for 24 female Palestinian prisoners and 15 male Palestinians. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=86.96s)]
*  It has been seven hours since that ceasefire went into effect, with the exception of two [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=92.0s)]
*  rocket alerts about 15 minutes after the set time it appears to be holding for now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=96.14s)]
*  The break in the fighting will last for four days, and if it goes well, we'll see 50 Israeli [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  hostages released for 150 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=104.88s)]
*  Now, despite the ceasefire, the Israelis are calling on residents in Gaza not to leave [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=108.32s)]
*  the southern part of the strip. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=112.78s)]
*  We saw some video online today of Palestinians trying to go to the north. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=114.38s)]
*  The Israelis fired into that crowd. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=118.06s)]
*  Sources inside Gaza say some people were hit in the legs. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=120.98s)]
*  The Israelis do not want civilians or militants, of course, going into the area that is controlled [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  by Israel. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=128.88s)]
*  They see it as a threat to their forces, and so they're trying to maintain defensive positions [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=129.88s)]
*  inside Gaza, understanding that this lull in fighting could be extremely dangerous for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=134.22s)]
*  the forces on the ground. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=139.1s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=140.34s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, this thing is not over. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=141.9s)]
*  Is Israel going to have trouble holding on to that narrative that they need to continue? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  Are they that concerned with the perception outside their borders? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=149.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=153.7s)]
*  Look, Hamas is hoping that this temporary ceasefire will be an opportunity to expand [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=154.7s)]
*  this to a larger truce. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=161.9s)]
*  But the reality is there will still be hostages inside Gaza after this initial group is released. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=163.62s)]
*  There's a caveat to the agreement that would allow an extension of the ceasefire for 10 [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=169.66s)]
*  additional hostages for a single day. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=175.9s)]
*  But still, the fighting will go on after this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=178.74s)]
*  Israeli officials, including the prime minister himself, Benjamin Netanyahu, they've made [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=181.02s)]
*  very clear that once this ceasefire is over, the Israelis will continue to operate against [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=184.98s)]
*  Hamas leadership inside Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=189.82s)]
*  This is something that will take not days, weeks, but months. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=192.26s)]
*  And so this is just four days of a break in the fighting. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=196.38s)]
*  It will give civilians on both sides of the fence the opportunity to exhale amid this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=200.26s)]
*  war that is approaching 50 days. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  But again, the fighting continues, but the anticipation is growing just two hours from [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=206.46s)]
*  now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=210.7s)]
*  People here hoping those hostages will be released to their loved ones. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=211.7s)]
*  Yeah, without question. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=214.46s)]
*  You know, Trey, we're talking a lot about the Israeli hostages, but what about the Palestinian [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=215.46s)]
*  prisoners? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  You said 24 women and 15 teenage males. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  Do we know anything about them and what crimes they committed? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=224.2s)]
*  We don't know much about them. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=230.34s)]
*  We know that the Israelis had one line item in the agreement indicating anyone convicted [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=231.34s)]
*  of murder could not be released. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=236.02s)]
*  But attempted murder was not on the list. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=238.38000000000002s)]
*  So you will likely see prisoners released as part of this deal who attempted stabbings [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=240.52s)]
*  or possibly even shootings. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  We'll bring you those details when we can confirm them based on the individual prisoners. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=246.96s)]
*  But this is an important point here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=250.84s)]
*  The Israelis at a three to one ratio are releasing Palestinian prisoners for hostages. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  The hostages are civilians that were dragged into Gaza against their will on October 7. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=258.66s)]
*  The prisoners that are being released were convicted of crimes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=264.1s)]
*  And so it is largely seen as unfair when you ask average Israelis about this deal. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  And there are mixed opinions about this ceasefire. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  On one hand, people are extremely excited. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=275.66s)]
*  They have hope for the first time in nearly 50 days that the loved ones and the Israeli [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=277.6s)]
*  civilians inside Gaza will finally be coming home. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=282.1s)]
*  But they also understand there are thousands of Israeli troops inside who will be caught [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=285.1s)]
*  flat-footed if Hamas or Islamic Jihad decides to launch an ambush during this lull in fighting. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=288.74s)]
*  Trey, there isn't a lot about this deal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  There's a lot that's being reported. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  There isn't a lot that's being confirmed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=297.18s)]
*  Just as early as yesterday, we were told it was women with children that they had [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=298.68s)]
*  bore in prison. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=302.94s)]
*  And now we're learning that it's a lot of teenagers who were arrested. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=305.06s)]
*  So that's a little bit different on the teenage side, the younger side of who's being released [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=309.62s)]
*  from prison. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=313.22s)]
*  But this one point I want to get your take on, Israel says they think there's 240 hostages [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=314.74s)]
*  there about. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=319.98s)]
*  It's very vague as to how many hostages, exactly who they are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=320.98s)]
*  We found out I think last week about a young girl that they thought was a hostage that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  was found dead. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  I do know that Israel released a list of names, 300 prisoners that could be released. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=330.26s)]
*  Do you know if they've negotiated from Hamas anything other than releasing of hostages [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=336.26s)]
*  like a list of names, proof of life? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=340.66s)]
*  Have they gotten more information or even tactically more information than maybe they're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=343.1s)]
*  putting out there? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=347.3s)]
*  Yes, so the Israelis have been demanding as part of this agreement that the Red Cross [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=350.3s)]
*  be able to visit the other hostages that are inside Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=353.9s)]
*  Hamas has pushed back on this point and it's likely for one major reason. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=357.14s)]
*  Hamas doesn't want Israel to know how many of the hostages are alive. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=360.86s)]
*  We talk about this 240 number and the tragic reality is that 240 Israelis will not ever [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=364.9s)]
*  come home. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=370.82s)]
*  Some of them are dead. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=372.02s)]
*  Some of them were dragged into Gaza. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  Some of them burned alive in their homes and haven't been recovered. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  That's how graphic and tragic the initial attack on southern Israel was. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  Hamas is trying to play also a psychological game here with Israel as they trickle out [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=382.26s)]
*  this information and also as they drag on these negotiations. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=387.18s)]
*  But it is important to note here the Qataris and they are the ones who negotiated this [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=391.26s)]
*  agreement. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=395.18s)]
*  They are hopeful that this could lead to something larger to get more hostages out. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=396.18s)]
*  We've been talking with officials on the ground in Doha and they are indicating that right [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=401.14s)]
*  now the talks are largely seen as positive when you compare to what it was like weeks [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=404.38s)]
*  ago in the height of this conflict before the ceasefire took place this morning. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=408.7s)]
*  So the coming days will be unpredictable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=413.46s)]
*  This is an incredibly fragile agreement. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=415.38s)]
*  We have to understand that Hamas and Islamic Jihad will use this opportunity to reconsolidate [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=417.41999999999996s)]
*  their forces and try to move their fighters into positions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=422.9s)]
*  So knowing that the Israelis will push deeper into Gaza. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=426.21999999999997s)]
*  But again the focus here today at this military base and across Israel is that hope that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=429.48s)]
*  people are holding on to. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  They want to see these 13 hostages released, women and children, and they hope this is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=435.56s)]
*  just the beginning. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=439.48s)]
*  So Trey in a Sky News interview Hamas's senior leader Basim Naim comes out and says these [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=440.48s)]
*  aren't hostages they are guests and it's impossible for us to hurt our guests. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=446.8s)]
*  Hamas hurt our guests. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=452.76s)]
*  Does anyone believe crap like this? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=454.12s)]
*  Yeah, he was texting me earlier today and we've spoken with that Hamas official a number [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=456.92s)]
*  of times. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  I've interviewed him in person in Gaza City. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  The reality is we have to look at the facts here and there's a lot of misinformation. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=467.36s)]
*  There's a lot of parallel attempts by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to spin this story to their [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  narrative. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=477.06s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that you will likely see in the coming hours and days video released [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  by the groups inside Gaza of these hostages and they'll be giving them things like biscuits [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=483.34s)]
*  and water just like they did when those initial four were released to American citizens and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=487.46s)]
*  to Israeli citizens a few weeks ago. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=491.17999999999995s)]
*  But they're not treating these hostages as guests. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=494.14s)]
*  They dragged them at gunpoint into Gaza after slaughtering their family members in their [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=496.64s)]
*  beds and in their kitchens. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  We saw this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=503.46s)]
*  We brought you the images of the bodies in these small communities, these quiet pro-peace [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=504.46s)]
*  communities. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  Some of the people that were killed were peace activists who were working with Gazan [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=509.9s)]
*  civilians to get the medical attention just before this massacre took place. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=513.5799999999999s)]
*  And so you're going to have a lot of spin by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=518.1s)]
*  We're going to cut through all of that because the reality here is that the exchange is happening [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=521.06s)]
*  between prisoners who have been convicted of crimes at a three to one ratio for hostages, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=524.98s)]
*  civilians, women and children who are not soldiers. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=529.86s)]
*  They were not people who were armed. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=532.3s)]
*  They were innocent and they were at home when this massacre took place. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=533.86s)]
*  So well said. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  Trey Angus live for us. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  We'll be back in with you very soon. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=538.98s)]
*  We appreciate your reporting and analysis. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=539.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=541.94s)]
*  Thanks Trey. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=542.94s)]
*  Brian, I think it was you who spoke to Liran Bernin. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=543.94s)]
*  He has twin brothers. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  They're being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=548.5s)]
*  Would you like to introduce this? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=549.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=550.86s)]
*  So essentially what you're seeing is women and children out first. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=551.86s)]
*  We understand that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=553.98s)]
*  But if you're a 26 year old, if you do 26 year old healthy men, you're probably going [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=554.98s)]
*  to be one of the last to be released. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=559.34s)]
*  And his brother realizes that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=561.0600000000001s)]
*  Listen. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=563.1800000000001s)]
*  It's a bag of mixed emotions right now, mostly depressed and sad. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=564.9799999999999s)]
*  But with some kind of hope for the release of the young kids and the elderly, especially [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=573.38s)]
*  the 13 that are getting released today. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=581.06s)]
*  It's a nightmare situation. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=586.2199999999999s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=589.58s)]
*  My brother doesn't meet the criteria and the selection process. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=590.58s)]
*  I don't know how to call it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=595.0200000000001s)]
*  And 26 healthy, healthy until 7th of October, of course. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=596.0200000000001s)]
*  And we don't know that health now. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=604.94s)]
*  But yeah, they are not mothers. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=607.7800000000001s)]
*  They are not little kids. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=609.4200000000001s)]
*  They are not elderly. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=611.26s)]
*  So keep on waiting. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=612.26s)]
*  That is so sad. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=616.1s)]
*  But of course, their lives matter, too. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=617.1s)]
*  We've spoken to so many families of hostages and hearing their personal stories about the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=618.38s)]
*  people who are held hostage. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=625.1s)]
*  You see the pictures, you see the missing persons posters all over New York City and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=626.26s)]
*  maybe in your city as well. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=631.3s)]
*  But hearing who these people are really brings a different element to this. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=632.78s)]
*  I remember speaking to one woman who has the two redheaded little boys, one's 10 months [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=637.18s)]
*  old, one's four years old. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=642.62s)]
*  A woman I spoke to, her nephews, and she was saying that the little boys, they're beautiful [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=646.3000000000001s)]
*  little boys. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=650.4200000000001s)]
*  He likes Spider-Man and he likes anything with wheels. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=651.4200000000001s)]
*  He likes trucks. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=653.82s)]
*  And just to, you know, these stories humanize the situation in a way that these pictures [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=654.82s)]
*  don't. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=659.5s)]
*  Those images are important. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=660.5s)]
*  But, you know, for 13 family members, for 13 families rather, this nightmare will be [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=661.5s)]
*  over. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=665.38s)]
*  But for 200 plus, it still goes on. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=666.38s)]
*  And the subhumans that inflicted this pain. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=668.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is all different level of depravity that we thought we left in medieval times. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=670.98s)]
*  But we haven't. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=676.18s)]
*  And there's people in America and around the world who think the Palestinian Hamas movement [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=677.18s)]
*  is something they should glue themselves to the road to support. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=681.66s)]
*  Great point. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLYh2EklxI&t=685.18s)]
