# Trump ends 'war on coal' with new EOs unleashing US energy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE)
*  Well, President Trump putting America first with his energy agenda, signing a handful [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=0.0s)]
*  of executive orders yesterday aimed at boosting the coal industry after years of decline. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=7.28s)]
*  We're ending Joe Biden's war on beautiful clean coal once and for all. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=14.14s)]
*  The value of untapped coal in our country is 100 times greater than the value of all [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=18.28s)]
*  the gold at Fort Knox. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=23.28s)]
*  And we're going to unleash it and make America rich and powerful again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=25.44s)]
*  It's reassuring for Americans to have a president in office who will truly put the United States [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=28.96s)]
*  of America above all else. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=34.2s)]
*  Well, that coal miner you saw right there is from West Virginia, the second largest [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=36.0s)]
*  coal producer in the nation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=43.32s)]
*  Roughly 86 percent of West Virginia's electricity came from coal power plants in 2022. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=44.52s)]
*  It was ranked fifth in total energy production. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=50.56s)]
*  And the governor of the great state of West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, joins us right [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=53.72s)]
*  now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=57.44s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=58.44s)]
*  Hey, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=59.44s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  It's great to have you as well. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump ran on this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  He said, if elected, I'm going to do this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=63.8s)]
*  The immediate thing is we've got a graphic that shows the number of people who have lost [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=66.6s)]
*  their jobs in the coal industry. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=70.56s)]
*  The immediate thing for you to do is hope that this revives coal industry in your state. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=72.48s)]
*  Well, look, I think this is a great first step. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump is keeping his promise to West Virginia and to the American people because [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=82.8s)]
*  he knows the importance of coal to the nation's energy portfolio. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=88.32s)]
*  And I think the other thing he really gets is that this is a national security question. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Right now, we are engaging in information technology fight, really a war against China [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=99.32s)]
*  in terms of how fast we can feed energy into data and information technology, because that's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=106.64s)]
*  the battlefield into the future. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=112.52s)]
*  And China is producing one coal-fired power plant after another. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=115.02s)]
*  And that's why it's important to not only have gas and other forms of energy in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=119.46s)]
*  portfolio, but to have coal as well, because coal is reliable, it's affordable, and I think [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  it's very much needed for the fights ahead. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=129.82s)]
*  And we've got a lot of it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=132.06s)]
*  And it's interesting. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=133.62s)]
*  And I, Governor, I think it's a great idea what you guys are doing, because, you know, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=134.62s)]
*  generally coal plants are more expensive and older. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=139.3s)]
*  But if you did what you said and put data centers or AI centers on top of a, you know, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  this endless supply of coal you've got, that's brilliant. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=149.66s)]
*  Not only do you put coal miners back to work, but you bring in a new industry. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=153.14s)]
*  Well, look, I think that's why this could be a combination of what President Trump is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=156.7s)]
*  doing, which is fabulous on the national level. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=161.62s)]
*  And right here in West Virginia, we're trying to pass a microgrids bill that's going to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=164.78s)]
*  leverage our energy resources. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=169.7s)]
*  Once again, gas and coal and water. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  And if you do both of those, then we can fuel the power needs of data centers and AI into [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  the future. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=180.94s)]
*  Typically, people are suggesting that the manufacturing facilities, the data facilities, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=181.94s)]
*  might be four to six times the power needs of traditional manufacturing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=187.26s)]
*  That means you need to have deep supplies of energy to run them and to compete against [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=192.38s)]
*  China. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  Coal is necessary as part of that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=198.86s)]
*  Gas is going to be very big. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=200.62s)]
*  And so I think President Trump is trying to light a spark. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  And it's a great thing that he's doing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=205.66000000000003s)]
*  And he ran on it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  He said, I'm going to do it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  And he checked that off his list. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  But Governor, you know, you've been around that state long enough and you know how Washington [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=212.06s)]
*  works. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  Next stop, a lot of lawsuits. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Look for a blizzard of lawsuits. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  Listen, I think we're going to expect to see the far left. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=221.5s)]
*  They tried to advance their ridiculous Green New Deal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=226.14s)]
*  I went into court and I've stopped them a number of times, but they're going to keep [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  coming again because they don't understand the national security importance of coal in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=233.76s)]
*  this new fight against China. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  But I think that we can be ready. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=240.7s)]
*  We got a good new attorney general in the mix. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=242.7s)]
*  And I think that the attorneys general and the governors combined can make a big difference [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=244.66s)]
*  on this national security priority. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=249.26s)]
*  We have to win the strategic information warfare against China. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=251.74s)]
*  Well you know about the attorney general job. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=257.18s)]
*  You were the AG for West Virginia. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=258.94s)]
*  Governor, thank you very much for joining us live and congratulations. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pbr99dkoE&t=260.94s)]
