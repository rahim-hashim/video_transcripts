# Disabled Tesla owner shocked to find car vandalized
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA)
*  A wheelchair-bound woman in Wichita, Kansas, is the latest victim of Tesla attacks after a guy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=0.0s)]
*  apparently keyed her entire car while she was out to dinner with her family at a nearby, as you can see in the background, an [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=6.96s)]
*  Olive Garden, and the damage could mount up to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  $10,000. Abigail Gill is that Tesla owner, and she joins us right now from my home state of Kansas. Abigail, good morning to you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=18.12s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=26.0s)]
*  So what a lot of people don't realize is that the Tesla has got this feature called Sentry, and if it's turned on, it actually tapes a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=27.36s)]
*  video of people near your car. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=36.64s)]
*  This guy in the pajama bottoms, you recognize him, right? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=39.56s)]
*  Yes, he was sitting directly behind us at the restaurant. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=44.96s)]
*  And so did he get up and go out and disappear for a little while or what happened? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=48.64s)]
*  Yeah, we noticed him walk by our table. I was eating with my family [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=55.24s)]
*  multiple times, and he was very recognizable because of his pajama pants. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=59.36s)]
*  Exactly, and I understand the Wichita police have [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  named this guy, ID'd this guy, as a person of interest, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=68.48s)]
*  Yes, they say they have a suspect, but we have not been given a name yet. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=73.28s)]
*  Okay, so as we've been hearing a lot of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=78.4s)]
*  Tesla damage, vandalism, stuff like that, as you know. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=82.24s)]
*  But here's what people need to understand. They might be trying to take it out on Elon Musk, Abigail, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=85.6s)]
*  but really they're not hurting him. They're hurting you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=91.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's a super sad thing and disappointing thing to see because, as you just said, it's not hurting Elon at all. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=96.36s)]
*  It's just hurting the families that are getting such valuable things damaged. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=103.12s)]
*  Right, and so how much is it going to cost [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=108.16s)]
*  something like ten thousand dollars to fix your car? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we got an estimate and I would say around seven thousand. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=114.96s)]
*  Man, I know you're hoping for justice. Ultimately, you want the guy to pay for the damage, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=119.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=127.28s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. Why did you want to have a Tesla? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=128.44s)]
*  First off, I think Tesla is just an overall great car. It's an amazing American-made company, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=134.24s)]
*  but it also has incredible accessibility features that allow me to drive long distances just like everybody else. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=140.24s)]
*  Right, exactly. Because of your disability, it's just a better car to handle what's going on there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=147.16s)]
*  What has this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=153.28s)]
*  vandalism, Abigail, taught you about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=155.28s)]
*  either resilience or how the community has reached out to you or what? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  We have had so many people reach out. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=163.92s)]
*  So many people offer to pay the damages and it's such a great thing to see people come together, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=167.36s)]
*  especially in times like this where innocent people are getting their cars damaged. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=174.4s)]
*  But I just think that the only person who needs to pay a single dime is the guy who thought it was okay to do this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=178.68s)]
*  Okay, very good. Abigail, thank you very much for joining us today from Wichita, Kansas. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-TzVeURpJA&t=190.4s)]
