# Israeli workers stage massive strike to push for hostage deal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ)
*  Well, straight to that Fox News alert. The funeral for Hirsch Goldberg, Poland, the American hostage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=0.0s)]
*  killed by Hamas in Gaza, will be held today at 9 a.m. Eastern. Also, President Biden finally [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=6.4s)]
*  returns to the White House after a two-week long vacation to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=12.64s)]
*  and the U.S. negotiating team to try and get a deal to get the hostages back. Oh good, the A-team's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=18.72s)]
*  back together. In New York City, thousands gathering at a vigil last night remembering the six [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=23.84s)]
*  murdered hostages found in a tunnel in Rafa over the weekend. And this is a live look at a protest [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=28.32s)]
*  in Israel calling for a ceasefire and hostage release deal as a massive labor strike causes [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=35.04s)]
*  a standstill at businesses, schools, and Israel's largest airport. Trey Yankst is live in Tel Aviv [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=40.88s)]
*  with the latest. Trey. Yeah, hey guys, good morning. Demonstrations erupted across Israel overnight [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  after the country's health ministry announced that six Israeli hostages had been executed in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=55.2s)]
*  Hamas captivity. We know thousands of people blocked the main highway in Israel's second largest [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=60.64s)]
*  city of Tel Aviv. Clashes unfolded between police and protesters with security forces bringing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=66.64s)]
*  horses and water cannons to clear the road. The demonstrators demanded their government reach a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=72.0s)]
*  hostage agreement and bring the remaining captives in Gaza home. Take a look. There are clear [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  disagreements between Israeli leadership, between Israel's defense minister, Yoav Galant, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=82.4s)]
*  and the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. For the people here in the streets [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  of Tel Aviv, they are not interested in politics. They are not interested in what the government has [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  to say unless it is bringing the hostages home. We do know that we want a deal now because those [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=96.0s)]
*  people supposed to be home yesterday. The unrest about the hostages shifted to civil protests with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  a broad general strike announced today. Israel's international airport was on strike for two hours [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=110.88s)]
*  this morning affecting incoming and outgoing flights. Other transportation affected as well, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  including Jerusalem's light rail train. With frustration growing across Israel about the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  lack of a deal, President Biden will meet with Vice President Harris in the situation room later [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=124.88s)]
*  today to meet with the American negotiating team. Officials in Washington will look for a way to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  move the ceasefire talks forward, giving both Israel and Hamas an exit ramp to end the war. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=134.16s)]
*  The uncertainty about Gaza comes as Israel launched fresh strikes against the Iran-backed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=139.36s)]
*  group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon overnight. The war inside Gaza has been ongoing for 332 days, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=143.68s)]
*  and at this point diplomacy has failed. Guys? You know, Trey, you have relationships in Hamas [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=150.96s)]
*  in the sense of reporting. Before October the 7th, you were embedded in there. You've talked with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=158.0s)]
*  some of the members there. They've even presented you with a PowerPoint. I guess my question to you [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  is, after reading everything, after hearing from some of your sources denying October the 7th, do [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=167.6s)]
*  you find the Hamas officials to be honest brokers in this negotiation? Lawrence, the short answer [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=172.4s)]
*  is no. And look, Pete made a great point earlier. Israel's not negotiating with a rational or [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=180.4s)]
*  reasonable actor. Hamas is an organization that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2006. At this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=185.84s)]
*  point, it's very splintered, and there's really one man at the very top, Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=192.16s)]
*  behind the October 7th massacre. The other two masterminds are dead. And so as the Israelis move [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=197.52s)]
*  forward with these conversations, they are getting feedback from Hamas indirectly as part of these [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=202.96s)]
*  negotiations, and they're unable to find a path forward. And at the same time, critics of Israel's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=207.68s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that he doesn't want a deal under the current terms. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=213.52s)]
*  And so we're at an impasse here in the region, and negotiators not just from the United States, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  but also from Qatar and from Egypt say they are reaching really the last ends of these efforts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=223.76s)]
*  And at this point, there has been no breakthrough in the talks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=229.44s)]
*  Yitre, sticking with Hamas, we had a father of one of the American hostages still there [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  on the program. Obviously, he wants a deal. He wants it yesterday to get his son back. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=237.28s)]
*  But he also said that part of the reason he's forward is that Hamas has been completely [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=241.68s)]
*  decimated as a fighting force and that that's the consensus amongst Israeli intelligence and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=245.12s)]
*  defense officials. Is that true? If a deal were cut, how decimated is Hamas at this point? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=249.84s)]
*  It is true. Most of the Hamas brigades inside Gaza have been destroyed and dismantled since the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=258.32s)]
*  Israeli ground campaign against the Strip started in late October. But Hamas will always be a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=264.24s)]
*  fighting force in Gaza and in the West Bank. They will act as an insurgency if there are other [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=270.24s)]
*  forces around that they decide they want to attack. And the West Bank is the perfect example. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=275.92s)]
*  Hamas doesn't control vast areas of territory in the West Bank, but they launch daily attacks, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=280.56s)]
*  whether it be attempted bombings or shooting attacks. And you'll see the same thing inside [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=285.76s)]
*  Gaza. They won't have the same fighting force that they had on the morning of October 7th when they [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  were able to send trained brigades of fighters across the border, thousands of them, into [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  southern Israel. But they still will be able to launch attacks. There is a controversy inside [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=300.48s)]
*  Israel and it has to do with the benchmark that the Israeli government has set for the goals of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  this country inside Gaza. There were two goals laid out by the prime minister. One, bring the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=310.72s)]
*  hostages home and two, defeat and destroy Hamas. The second goal is not possible. They can dismantle [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=315.6s)]
*  the brigades that exist inside the Gaza Strip. But Hamas as an organization will continue to exist [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=321.6s)]
*  and they will continue to attack Israel in some capacity. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=326.88s)]
*  Trey, to that point, at what ratio of those protesters there are saying, look, we don't want [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=331.52s)]
*  a deal. To the point of everyone's been saying that that's a deal with the devil. We actually [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=337.84s)]
*  aren't protesting to negotiate with terrorists. We are here advocating for the return of our [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=341.92s)]
*  hostages and we want militarily a global support. Is there a representation of that voice there? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=346.56s)]
*  Trey [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=351.92s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And look, the demonstrators that were in the streets of Tel Aviv last night and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=354.0s)]
*  into today represent a portion of this society. There are certainly people, especially in the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=358.48s)]
*  Likud party, supportive of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who say there should be no [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  ceasefire, that the war should continue even if that risks the lives of hostages. And that's part [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=368.24s)]
*  of the divide currently in Israeli society. And not just at the civilian level. At the very top [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=373.76s)]
*  of the Israeli government, there have been screaming matches in the cabinet between Israel's [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=378.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Galant. Galant wants a deal. He [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  wants to bring the hostages home and then restart the war against Hamas. Netanyahu does not want [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=388.24s)]
*  that type of deal at this moment in the conversations. And so it has created a rift [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  between the leadership of this country and questions about what the prime minister, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=398.56s)]
*  ultimately the decision maker in all of this, will do in the days ahead. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=408.56s)]
*  Trey. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMAhH3ndogQ&t=409.2s)]
