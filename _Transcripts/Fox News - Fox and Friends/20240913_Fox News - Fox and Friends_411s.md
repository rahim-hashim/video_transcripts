# Top CEO throws cold water on Harris debate claim
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris setting set to rally voters in Pennsylvania today while former President Trump out in Las Vegas. Rich Edson is live at the White House. Hey Rich. Hey good morning Lawrence Steve Ainsley and Brian. Well we're a couple of months away from Election Day. That means we're going to see rallies in swing states and that's what we're seeing today. You've got Vice President Kamala Harris. She's in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania today. That by the way Luzerne County which former President Trump won by more than six percentage points in 2020. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=0.0s)]
*  It's also about 20 miles from Scranton where President Biden was born. Trump has a rally in Nevada in Las Vegas. Then this evening following fundraising and an afternoon press conference in California. That is not a swing state. Yesterday in Arizona Trump offered voters another tax exemption. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=30.0s)]
*  We will end all taxes on overtime. You know what that means. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=47.0s)]
*  That gives people more of an incentive to work. People who work overtime are among the hardest working citizens in our country. And for too long no one in Washington has been looking out for them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=55.0s)]
*  The Harris campaign calls the pitch desperate and claims Trump is saying whatever it takes to try to trick people into voting for him. The vice president was also pitching voters on the economy at her rally in North Carolina. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=66.0s)]
*  We're going to have to stop inflation and send us into a recession by the middle of next year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=96.0s)]
*  Though Goldman CEO David Solomon says a bigger deal has been made of that report than it should be. He said in an interview that the report shows the difference between the two sets of policy is about two tenths of 1 percent in GDP growth. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=102.0s)]
*  We'll see that in the next poll. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=146.0s)]

*  We'll see that in the next poll. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=228.0s)]
*  When prices go up, my income does not, just like others. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=230.0s)]
*  So I have gone from things being tight every month [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=234.0s)]
*  to having to go to local food banks and churches [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=236.0s)]
*  at the end of each month for food. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=240.0s)]
*  I pray that Trump wins. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=242.0s)]
*  Gosh, that's heartbreaking. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=244.0s)]
*  Jacqueline has a similar story. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=246.0s)]
*  My husband, a former police officer, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=248.0s)]
*  now works in a union shop to provide a better income. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=250.0s)]
*  My father has a small business for 51 years, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=253.0s)]
*  and after our business being a well-known [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=256.0s)]
*  local staple in the community, we almost closed our doors [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=258.0s)]
*  due to the last four years under Biden and Harris. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=261.0s)]
*  And it's just a stark contrast, because I remember going out there [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=264.0s)]
*  interviewing business owners, especially restaurants, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=267.0s)]
*  that were a part of a franchise, and they got a second location, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=270.0s)]
*  and they thought that the Trump tax cuts, as well as, you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=273.0s)]
*  getting rid of those regulations, was going to continue. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=276.0s)]
*  It didn't, and they end up closing those same franchises. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=279.0s)]
*  So, stark contrast. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=283.0s)]
*  You know, and inflation hits everybody, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=285.0s)]
*  but the big question is, how will it impact new voters, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=287.0s)]
*  you know, people who might still live at home, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=290.0s)]
*  or, you know, a lot of their finances are dictated by their parents? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=293.0s)]
*  And the reason I bring that up is because earlier this week, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=298.0s)]
*  Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=301.0s)]
*  750,000 people apparently have gone to Vote.gov. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=304.0s)]
*  They had been doing just 30,000 a day. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=311.0s)]
*  Now they are up to, they're knocking on the door of a million people registered. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=314.0s)]
*  So you wonder how big an impact, ultimately, will Taylor Swift actually have? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=318.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not suggesting all those people are going to vote for her, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=325.0s)]
*  but if 10% did, that's a big number. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=330.0s)]
*  Right, but she got a younger vote anyway. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=333.0s)]
*  I mean, the younger vote tends to go to Kamala Harris anyway. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=335.0s)]
*  And she has most of her fans outside, Dave Portnoy, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=338.0s)]
*  or younger. He's a Swifty. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=343.0s)]
*  Well, and you know, we talked about this last week. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=346.0s)]
*  Didn't he say he's voting for Trump? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=349.0s)]
*  Right, he says, I'm going to vote for Trump because you should not vote for who I vote for. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=352.0s)]
*  I'm just telling you who I'm voting for. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=355.0s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=356.0s)]
*  Because a celebrity should not tell you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=357.0s)]
*  And last week we were talking about how Donald Trump has, for the most part, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=358.0s)]
*  corralled the bro vote, which are men, 18 to 29. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=361.0s)]
*  The problem is, the young people are hard to poll, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=367.0s)]
*  because they don't answer the phone. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=372.0s)]
*  And so it's hard to figure out exactly which way they're going. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=374.0s)]
*  They're always in the jam. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=376.0s)]
*  The young people are hard to poll, and Trump voters are hard to poll as well, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=377.0s)]
*  because they watch media on mainstream every day, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=380.0s)]
*  literally demonize them every single day. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=383.0s)]
*  And so when someone calls them, they don't want to pick up the phone [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=386.0s)]
*  to say who they're going to vote for. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=388.0s)]
*  They don't want the pushback. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=390.0s)]
*  So that's why he underperforms every single poll. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=391.0s)]
*  The question is, will the younger people actually go to the polls? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=394.0s)]
*  Will they go and vote? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=396.0s)]
*  That's the great unknown. Stay tuned. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=398.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaqAhA4aLew&t=401.0s)]
