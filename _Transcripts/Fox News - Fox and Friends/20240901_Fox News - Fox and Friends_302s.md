# TIME magazine under fire for 'irresponsible' flip-flop
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738)
*  We're joining forces to defeat government corruption, restore free speech and make America [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=0.0s)]
*  healthy again. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=7.44s)]
*  We're going to make America healthy again, you know? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=8.44s)]
*  We're a nation that is not doing well in a lot of ways and we're not doing so well with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=11.76s)]
*  health. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=18.52s)]
*  We're going to get toxic chemicals out of our environment and we're going to get them [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=19.52s)]
*  out of our food supply. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=22.84s)]
*  We're going to get them out of our bodies. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Former President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. uniting with the mission to make America [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=28.32s)]
*  healthy again. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=33.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, Time Magazine now suggests ultra processed foods really aren't that bad despite [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=34.92s)]
*  publishing an article saying the exact opposite just one year ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=40.96s)]
*  Here with reaction is Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Sapphire. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Nicole, before I ask you for the definition of ultra processed food so we can continue [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=50.36s)]
*  The subtitle for that article is why one dietitian is speaking up for ultra processed foods. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=56.56s)]
*  That seems like such an oxymoron. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=64.28s)]
*  Why don't you just give us the definition and then we'll have this conversation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=66.28s)]
*  Yeah, some of these articles really are irresponsible in their messaging and so when we're talking [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=69.92s)]
*  about food, obviously, you know, walking outside, getting your fresh fruits and vegetables and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=75.12s)]
*  even animal products, farm to table is the healthiest thing you could possibly do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=80.06s)]
*  We also have a lot of minimally processed foods like olive oil, tuna fish, you know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=84.48s)]
*  because it's changed from its natural state. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Now it's put into oil or given some salt. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=92.24s)]
*  But then what we're really talking about here are those ultra processed food, which not [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  only is changed from its natural state, but additives, chemicals, preservatives and even [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=98.72s)]
*  dyes and artificial flavorings are now being added to it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=103.4s)]
*  Think of your pantry. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=107.24s)]
*  If you walk into your pantry and something has a shelf life of more than a couple of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=108.24s)]
*  weeks, maybe even a couple of years, that's probably ultra processed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=112.36s)]
*  And that's what we're talking here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=116.2s)]
*  And the truth is, Rachel, not all ultra processed foods are equally bad for you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=117.68s)]
*  But the bottom line is it's all kind of bad for you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=122.76s)]
*  And so the messaging shouldn't be, well, they're not that bad. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=126.24s)]
*  The messaging should be how can we get healthier, more nutritious foods to into the people's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=128.98s)]
*  homes? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=134.32s)]
*  And so they're not reliant on cheaper, unhealthier alternatives. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=135.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=138.0s)]
*  This article, this this dietitian talks about she's concerned that we're shaming people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=140.0s)]
*  And in particular, they talk about poor people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=143.44s)]
*  And she makes the case that somehow poor. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=146.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, we subsidize a lot of this ultra processed food and therefore make [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=147.88s)]
*  it more cheaper for people who have tighter budgets on their food. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=151.8s)]
*  That's a problem that the government's doing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=156.1s)]
*  But she also just says we're shaming poor people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=157.76s)]
*  They can't afford it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=159.76s)]
*  They don't know better. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=160.76s)]
*  They just don't they don't know how to make better choices. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=161.76s)]
*  I found it very patronizing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  It kind of reminded me of when they say, oh, brown and black people are too poor and dumb [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=166.08s)]
*  to get a driver's license or an ID card before they vote. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=175.8s)]
*  What do you say that, you know, making this affordable for every demographic as a societal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=176.8s)]
*  goal? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=182.56s)]
*  Listen, the harsh reality is ultra processed foods have been linked to obesity, diabetes, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=183.56s)]
*  cancer, dementia and early death. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=188.68s)]
*  They are not healthy for you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'm glad to hear Make America Healthy Again is making its comeback. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=192.36s)]
*  You know, that was my first book. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=196.28s)]
*  But the subject title of that book was How Big Government and Bad Behavior Cause Trillion [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=197.6s)]
*  Dollar Crisis. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's what we are dealing with. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  If you go into an American supermarket, it is widely full of ultra processed foods. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=204.8s)]
*  Sixty percent of the American diet constitutes of these ultra processed, cheap and easy foods. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=209.6s)]
*  If you look over at Italy, only 10 percent of their diet are these ultra processed foods. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=215.36s)]
*  That's why they have lower chronic illness rates and have longer lifespans. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=220.08s)]
*  We as a country need to do something. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=224.56s)]
*  We need to make sure that people have access to these healthier foods. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=225.72s)]
*  And we can't just say it's shaming them because they're having it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=229.0s)]
*  We need to educate them and we need to make sure that they have access. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  We need to support our farmers, make it so that farm to table is more affordable for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=234.8s)]
*  people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=239.52s)]
*  Our supermarkets need to have healthier options and we need to do away with this big food [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=240.52s)]
*  industry that spends billions of dollars a year targeting a lot of these low income [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=244.28s)]
*  families by ways of saying that it's kind of healthy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  It's not healthy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=252.84s)]
*  We need to do better. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=254.56s)]
*  Yeah, R.F.K. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=255.56s)]
*  Jr. told me in an interview that we had that in Italy, you brought up Italy, that if you're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=256.56s)]
*  poor and you have government assistance for food, it works at the farmers market. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=260.16s)]
*  And that's the kind of stuff that we can do. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=265.64s)]
*  By the way, on shaming, I just shamed Pete Hegseth out of ordering McDonald's. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=267.6s)]
*  So it works. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=272.64s)]
*  Well, that's OK. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=273.64s)]
*  It works. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=274.64s)]
*  We're ordering a slightly healthy breakfast. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=275.64s)]
*  Thanks so much, Nicole. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=277.64s)]
*  Always great having you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=279.0s)]
*  This topic, we're going to talk more about it because Make America Healthy Again is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=280.0s)]
*  definitely become a campaign issue thanks to Trump and R.F.K. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=283.64s)]
*  Jr. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglhWX_H738&t=287.64s)]
