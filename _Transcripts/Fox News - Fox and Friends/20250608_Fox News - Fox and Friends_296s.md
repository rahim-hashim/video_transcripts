# More young Americans turning toward Catholicism: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o)
*  Well, more Americans are turning to Catholicism with the National Catholic Register saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=0.0s)]
*  quote certain diocese are reporting increases of 30%, 40%, even 50%, even more than some [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=5.62s)]
*  even 70% when it comes to converts last year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=13.38s)]
*  So what is making Catholicism cool again? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=17.02s)]
*  Gen Z influencer Isabel Brown, the host of the Isabel Brown Show joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=20.62s)]
*  Isabel, this is such a fascinating topic. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=25.86s)]
*  The Free Press also had an article last week come out about why is Catholicism cool again? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=28.22s)]
*  What is happening specifically with Gen Z? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=34.68s)]
*  Great point, Rachel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=39.62s)]
*  This is a cultural revolution largely led by young people and to see headlines come [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=40.62s)]
*  out last week that what makes Catholicism cool is trending in America is a very fascinating [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=45.32s)]
*  moment in our culture because it just goes to show that God's not done with American [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=51.86s)]
*  culture yet. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=56.66s)]
*  Throughout my lifetime, really, America has culturally become one of the biggest exports [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=58.0s)]
*  of cultural degeneracy around the world, particularly in the West. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=62.24s)]
*  You watch the degradation of marriage, the normalization of transitioning children, abortion [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=66.48s)]
*  by the millions for the most vulnerable in our society over the past several decades. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=71.92s)]
*  And in the midst of this darkness, we're watching young people run back towards God, not even [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=76.6s)]
*  towards rainbow washed half in half out cultural Christianity like I think we've seen throughout [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  the last several years, but tradition with a capital T preferring the traditional Latin [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=87.7s)]
*  mass wanting the Eucharist and reviving the Christianity that the world has known for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=92.5s)]
*  2000 years as we continue to transform our culture in America from the inside out, bringing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=98.1s)]
*  God back to the world again. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=104.02s)]
*  So what is it specifically about Catholicism? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=108.14s)]
*  There's like sort of there's a very traditional form of Catholicism, the liturgy, as you talked [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=109.14s)]
*  about the traditional Latin mass, the devotions, the rules and strictures around [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=114.06s)]
*  Catholicism. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=118.26s)]
*  What is it specifically about that that is attracting young people? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=119.26s)]
*  Is it the aestheticism? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=123.18s)]
*  Is it that, you know, they can trace it back to St. Peter and there's sort of a lot of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=124.9s)]
*  history and ritual around it? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=129.26s)]
*  What is it? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=131.54s)]
*  Because it seems to be especially men. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=132.54s)]
*  It is largely led by young men. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=136.22s)]
*  And there's so many reasons contributing to this revival of coolness in Catholicism again. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=138.38s)]
*  We have an American pope. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=143.54s)]
*  You're watching the number one app on the app store be a crack, a Catholic prayer app. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  Hello. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=149.94s)]
*  Over the past several months, celebrities are sharing their experience going to mass [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=150.94s)]
*  on social media. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=154.5s)]
*  But I think what this really boils down to is a level of relationship and intimacy with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  Jesus offered through the Holy Eucharist that is unfound anywhere else in Christianity around [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=160.14s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=166.62s)]
*  You're looking at an opportunity not just to talk to Jesus through prayer, not just [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=167.62s)]
*  to have a personal relationship with him in reading scripture, but to intimately touch [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=171.14s)]
*  him through his body and blood every Sunday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=175.14s)]
*  That is a sense of relationship that you can't find anywhere else. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=178.26s)]
*  And young people are realizing the depth and the substance of traditional Christianity [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=181.94s)]
*  through Catholicism that's often been missing in our culture for the last several decades. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting, too. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=191.33999999999997s)]
*  It seems to also be a response to sort of the the vapidness and the the lack of authenticity [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=193.14s)]
*  of so much that is happening virtually in their lives on their phones, these fake relationships [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=199.7s)]
*  online. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=205.14s)]
*  And is it a response to to AI and and and social media? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  Being able to touch something and have that tangible experience is certainly contributing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=213.38s)]
*  I attend a beautiful Catholic parish here in Alexandria, Virginia, and every single [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=217.78s)]
*  mass is bursting at the seams with standing room only. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=222.38s)]
*  But I also think it's a response to the lack of authenticity that we're finding in American [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=225.54s)]
*  churches throughout my lifetime. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=229.34s)]
*  When you see churches go viral on social media for reciting the Sparkle Creed on Sunday morning, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  praising the non-binary God, which, yes, is a real thing, instead of the Nicene Creed, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=237.26s)]
*  when you're seeing BLM flags to celebrate and cultural Marxism flown outside of Episcopal [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=242.22s)]
*  churches all over the country, it's causing people to stop and think, is this really what [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=247.3s)]
*  the substance of my faith, the authenticity of my faith and a true relationship with God [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=251.9s)]
*  is supposed to be about? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=256.82s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=258.3s)]
*  I think what the Catholic Church offers to young people is not a chance for the church [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  to become more like our broken secular culture, but rather us to transform ourselves and our [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=262.86s)]
*  culture to transform itself in running back to God again to revive what is good and true [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=268.58s)]
*  and beautiful. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, thank you, Isabel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZehxLmo59o&t=274.78000000000003s)]
