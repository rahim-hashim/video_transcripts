# Biden's outgoing ICE chief calls out admin over major policy delay
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ)
*  President Biden's acting ICE director set to retire from his post tomorrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And this morning he's speaking out about his time with the agency, the crisis at the border, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=5.0s)]
*  and the challenges that his agents are facing. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=10.0s)]
*  Acting ICE director Patrick Leckleitner joins us right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Pieden known as PJ. Congratulations, great career. Thanks for everything you've done. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=15.0s)]
*  You don't do this to get rich, you do it because you care about the country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=19.0s)]
*  But just right now, the state of ICE. You guys are going to get a lot of attention. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=22.0s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of money flowing your direction and a chance to build up the force. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=27.0s)]
*  How much is needed? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=31.0s)]
*  Well, to do what the new administration is proposing and what we're seeing, you know, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=33.0s)]
*  because they're working for the transition, we're going to need a lot more people, a lot more resources. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=37.0s)]
*  Because, you know, if you double what we have currently, then we're going to need double the money, you know, to do that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=41.0s)]
*  So the numbers are going to be flexible. New administration has those. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=47.0s)]
*  And I'm not privy to that because that's the new administration. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=50.0s)]
*  But it's going to be a lot more. They're saying, you know, upwards of, you know, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=53.0s)]
*  maybe, you know, ten times the amount of detention space that we have, if not more, who knows? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=56.0s)]
*  But it depends on how many detention beds you want. Right now we have about 41,005. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=62.0s)]
*  You know, if you're doubling that, you got to double the money. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=68.0s)]
*  125,000. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=71.0s)]
*  Yeah, talking honey, that's triple. And it's just triple the money to do it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=72.0s)]
*  So with given the resources and given the time, our folks are resilient and capable and they're going to do it and meet the mission. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=76.0s)]
*  And we have always done that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=83.0s)]
*  You put a lot of time into this agency over 30 years. You've served different administrations, Republican and Democrat. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=84.0s)]
*  What was the biggest challenge with this administration? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, it's always a challenge understanding kind of where the administration wants to go and, you know, what their priorities are. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=96.0s)]
*  And whenever administrations change, you got to adapt to that. Right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=103.0s)]
*  And the workforce just wants to do their job. They just want to be told, go out, do your job and do it well. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=107.0s)]
*  And one of the problems and the issues is just kind of communicating that from the leadership side, like keep your head down, keep doing your job. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=112.0s)]
*  Don't worry about it. We got your back. And workforce empowerment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=121.0s)]
*  Well, I was just going to say, you know, PJ, you're talking about how the incoming administration is going to take a lot more money because of different priorities. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=125.0s)]
*  Trump's priorities different than Joe Biden's, obviously. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=134.0s)]
*  And you were talking about the workforce where, you know, we've heard from ICE agents, they were frustrated that they didn't get to do their job. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=137.0s)]
*  So as the new administration comes in and suddenly removing criminal aliens is going to be a priority. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=144.0s)]
*  If you had one do over or if Joe Biden would have ever called you on the phone and said, PJ, what should I be doing? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=152.0s)]
*  What would you say to him? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=160.0s)]
*  I would have liked to see that executive or they implemented roughly just over a year ago. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=161.0s)]
*  Like that helped a lot. And we could have gotten that implemented a long time before that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=166.0s)]
*  It would have helped a lot. Why didn't they do it? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=171.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. And I'm you know, I execute. I run the agency. I execute. I enforce. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=174.0s)]
*  But I don't know why they didn't do that earlier. I know it was in process for a long time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=179.0s)]
*  I would have liked to seen it earlier. I think it helped a lot. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=183.0s)]
*  It did did really help our mission. But I wanted to see that earlier. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=186.0s)]
*  Listen, we've been drawn out of our core mission to help CBP. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=190.0s)]
*  We're going to help all the time when we do that at the border. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=194.0s)]
*  We also get pulled to help Secret Service. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=197.0s)]
*  We've had thousands of agents pulled from HSI to help Secret Service. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=199.0s)]
*  We have to because it's a national security priority. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=202.0s)]
*  But Secret Service needs more money. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=205.0s)]
*  Give them more money. Do their job the right way. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=207.0s)]
*  Give more money to the border so that CBP can actually do their job and lock that down a little better. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=210.0s)]
*  But don't keep pulling us off our core mission sets, which is the interior enforcement for these fugitive operations teams going out there and getting these. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=215.0s)]
*  We have almost eight million people on the non-detained docket now that we have to go find. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=222.0s)]
*  It's a big challenge and our people are capable. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=226.0s)]
*  We're going to go out and do that going forward. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=229.0s)]
*  I'm going to be cheering from the sidelines. I'm going to be sporting them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=231.0s)]
*  But it's not a small challenge. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=234.0s)]
*  I know you're currently serving obviously in the Biden administration. You retire tomorrow. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=236.0s)]
*  I know your men and women have been victimized and criticized, demonized. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=240.0s)]
*  We were talking about this in the break before just for doing their job. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=244.0s)]
*  You say we follow the law. We are a law enforcement agency. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=247.0s)]
*  We're not political. What's your advice for the incoming acting ICE director? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=249.0s)]
*  His name is Caleb Vitello. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=253.0s)]
*  You know him well. You know Tom Homan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=255.0s)]
*  You have all worked together. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=257.0s)]
*  What's your advice for him going in as the as the new acting ICE director under Donald Trump? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Caleb knows this and he's a good man is just keep supporting that ICE workforce. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=263.0s)]
*  Make sure that we have our eyes on them and make sure that they are adequately resourced. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=268.0s)]
*  He knows that. But just recently the new administration is not even in yet. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=274.0s)]
*  And there's already vandalism at some of our offices. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=278.0s)]
*  They're spraying, you know, abolish ICE again and all this nonsense. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=281.0s)]
*  We're just doing our job. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=284.0s)]
*  It's vilification of public servants, first responders. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=286.0s)]
*  And my heart goes out to the first responders who are in L.A. right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Right. It's my whole life doing this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=294.0s)]
*  And it's preposterous that people vilify these first responders that are taking their life in their own hands here, going out, supporting the communities. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=296.0s)]
*  And, you know, people just disregard that and they demonize us and vilify us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=304.0s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=309.0s)]
*  That comes from certain political rhetoric who thinks you're doing a bad job, who wishes you didn't exist. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=310.0s)]
*  And it's not Donald Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=317.0s)]
*  No, no. And we should never vilify these folks ever. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=318.0s)]
*  And it's nonsense that we do this on either side of this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=322.0s)]
*  But yeah, you should be outraged by that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=325.0s)]
*  I am outraged by it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=327.0s)]
*  It is absolutely preposterous. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=328.0s)]
*  These people are just doing their job and forcing the law. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=330.0s)]
*  You don't like it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=332.0s)]
*  Talk to your elected representatives and influence policy and law. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=333.0s)]
*  Or change your elected representatives. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=336.0s)]
*  Or change them. That's right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=337.0s)]
*  Patrick, thank you for your service. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=339.0s)]
*  Thanks for stopping by. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=341.0s)]
*  We hope you have a fantastic retirement. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=342.0s)]
*  I'll figure out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=344.0s)]
*  What does it mean to say I'm retiring tomorrow? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=345.0s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=346.0s)]
*  First time in my life I don't have a plan, but I'm going to figure it out. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=347.0s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=350.0s)]
*  You have a big party planned, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=351.0s)]
*  Nothing yet. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=353.0s)]
*  I wish you goodbye. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=354.0s)]
*  All right. Thank you, sir. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwSUOjtrPKQ&t=355.0s)]
