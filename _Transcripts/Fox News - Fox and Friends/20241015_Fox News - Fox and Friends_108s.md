# Netanyahu reveals plans for strike on Iran
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY)
*  This is a Fox News alert. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly telling President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden he is willing to strike Iran's military rather than oil or nuclear facilities as tensions [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=5.44s)]
*  are rising in the Middle East. Matt Finn joins us live from Tel Aviv. Matt? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=11.92s)]
*  Angel, you may recall about two weeks ago now when Iran launched roughly 200 missiles here [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=17.12s)]
*  into Israel, Fox aired it live. Really a horrifying moment. Well, since then, the world has been [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=23.44s)]
*  waiting to see how Israel will respond. The concern is that if Israel is too aggressive, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=28.32s)]
*  the shadow war between Iran and Israel could become a full blown confrontation. Well, now we [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=33.84s)]
*  have some insight into Israel's plan. The Washington Post reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=38.32s)]
*  Netanyahu told President Biden in a phone call that Israel will strike Iranian military sites [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  instead of oil or nuclear locations. That information signals Netanyahu might be willing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  to avoid greater escalation with Iran, at least for now, and he's aware that any type of strike [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  against Iran could actually impact our U. S elections. Netanyahu reportedly saying we will [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=60.32s)]
*  listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  national interests. Also happening today here in the Middle East, we expect a United States [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=70.96s)]
*  anti missile system called FAD for short to arrive here in Israel. A FAD battery, as it's called, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=75.6s)]
*  is manufactured by Lockheed Martin. It's a billion dollar defense system against missiles. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=82.08s)]
*  And the Pentagon says sending that system here to Israel underscores our, quote, iron clad alliance [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=86.88s)]
*  with Israel. Back to you guys. Lawrence. Great job, Matt. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY&t=94.48s)]
