# Harley-Davidson reverses course after stunning backlash
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA)
*  Meanwhile Harley-Davidson just the latest company to drop DEI initiatives following social media outrage and pressure from longtime loyal bikers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=0.0s)]
*  the company saying quote as a consumer brand we will focus exclusively on growing the sport of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Motorcycling and retaining our loyal riding community, but the board of directors still silent on the future and fate [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=13.36s)]
*  Of the company's quote woke CEO and chairman Fox News contributor and out kick.com columnist Mary Katherine Ham [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=20.12s)]
*  Joins us now Mary Katherine great to see you this morning [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=27.18s)]
*  This is a pretty stunning moment for Harley-Davidson where bikers are saying this is not the brand that we've been devoted to for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=30.46s)]
*  half a century or more [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=37.14s)]
*  What happens here with Harley-Davidson? Well, if you have to say to your customers what we're gonna focus on is motorcycles [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=39.06s)]
*  Okay, that's that seems like a bad turn you take you've made a bad turn if you have to remind them of that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=45.82s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of these companies do they get so caught up in this case. There's a German-born [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=50.68s)]
*  CEO who was the head of Puma and did a turnaround there to his credit who is now the head of this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=55.940000000000005s)]
*  120 year old brand about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  America and open roads and motorcycles and it when he calls himself in a controversial clip [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=64.62s)]
*  I believe in 2020 the Taliban of sustainability [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=70.14s)]
*  Meaning he's going to be as extreme as possible in his environmental [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=74.18s)]
*  Edicts for this company it makes people think like maybe he's not so into the customer base that he's serving [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=79.52s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't understand who he's selling motorcycles to and maybe he's not that interested in selling motorcycles, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=85.92s)]
*  I think the board should be concerned about that part because when you start alienating the people who've built your brand [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=92.68s)]
*  Even if you're doing it for what you think is a good reason. It will not go well for you. Please see bud light [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=99.08s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, Harley-Davidson saying since we're not we're not doing DEI. We stopped [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  in April but this all goes back to a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=108.76s)]
*  Document they put out in 2022 where they said they were going to implement things like sponsored trainings and workshops focused on DEI [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=112.0s)]
*  nearly 1500 employees participated in an inclusion and belonging workshop and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=118.72s)]
*  Employees participated in a summit held by quote white men as full diversity [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=123.92s)]
*  partners [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=129.92s)]
*  It is interesting as you point out to have somebody in charge who doesn't fundamentally seem to understand a brand that is quintessentially [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=131.48s)]
*  American this is not Europe and this is not by the way [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=138.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, DEI is kind of American and we exported it across the world, but this is not Harley-Davidson [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=142.16s)]
*  Yeah, look it may indeed be a mismatch. I think he's made some improvements [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  But when you start talking about those kind of workshops and that that is your sort of raise on Dexter for doing your job [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  No [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  The reason you're here is to sell motorcycles and I think that a lot of these companies have gotten backlash such that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  Finally, they're sort of being bullied into being neutral like bullied into doing your actual job [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=167.76s)]
*  There's enough pain from enough boycotts and enough folks have spoken out at this point for several companies that they go [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=173.16s)]
*  Hey, maybe we should just get back to the basics and that is good for everyone [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=180.0s)]
*  That's good for the customers and that's good for the company [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=183.88s)]
*  I wonder though if a guy who sold himself this way and said these [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=186.06s)]
*  Controversial things in the past can really let go of this philosophy and stick to the motorcycles. It's gonna need to for Harley-Davidson [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Alright Mary Katherine Ham. Thanks for being with us this morning. Thanks [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlIx7qSfeA&t=195.64s)]
