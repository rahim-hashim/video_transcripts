# California fires burn through over 37,000 acres
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34)
*  Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now, fire crews in Los Angeles racing [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=1.12s)]
*  to contain an out-of-control wildfire, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=3.52s)]
*  bracing for more strong winds to threaten their progress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=5.96s)]
*  16 victims are confirmed dead, and more than 100,000 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=9.52s)]
*  remain evacuated. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=14.32s)]
*  Joining us now is the latest with California Fire Battalion [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  Chief David Acuna. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=19.04s)]
*  Chief, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=20.6s)]
*  Let's start with just an update. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=22.68s)]
*  First, how do we feel about containment? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=24.84s)]
*  What areas are the most threatened [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=26.96s)]
*  as we wake up this morning? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=28.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for having me on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=32.36s)]
*  Well, honestly, the entire perimeter is threatened. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=33.68s)]
*  Although we are at 11% and 15% containment for the Palisades [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=38.4s)]
*  and Eaton, respectively, the concern [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=42.64s)]
*  is these winds as they go back and forth. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=45.76s)]
*  Adam did a great job of pointing out [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  all the weather of the Senate and the winds. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=49.92s)]
*  One of the elements that we look at as well, though, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=53.8s)]
*  is that all that air ends up being a pocket off the ocean. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=56.48s)]
*  Well, as soon as the winds stop, the winds [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=61.0s)]
*  go the other direction. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  So we've been dealing with these battling winds that threaten [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=66.56s)]
*  every inch of that line, which is [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=69.64s)]
*  why we're being so cautious with the containment percentage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=71.56s)]
*  So Chief, right now, as we stand here today, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=75.44s)]
*  how do you feel about the resources available to you? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  Do you have everything you need to best fight these fires? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=81.24s)]
*  We have more than 12,000 firefighters [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=86.44s)]
*  assigned to these incidents and with more on the way. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=88.84s)]
*  With seven states contributing, as well as Canada and Mexico, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=92.36s)]
*  it's all hands on deck. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=98.16s)]
*  And we're thankful that everyone in the Western region [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  and internationally are coming to our aid. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=102.96s)]
*  So let me ask you a couple of questions of personal curiosity [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=105.88s)]
*  as we watch this fire and the firefighting unfold. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=108.6s)]
*  We see a lot from the helicopters, the super scoopers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=111.24s)]
*  It's on the screen right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=113.8s)]
*  We see fire retardant being dropped. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=114.96s)]
*  Tell me a little bit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=118.0s)]
*  You drop water. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=118.8s)]
*  You drop retardant. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=119.72s)]
*  Is the aim to hit the area of the fire? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  Is it to aim ahead of where you think the fire is headed? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=124.8s)]
*  Is it both? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about the strategy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=128.72s)]
*  from an aerial perspective in fighting these fires. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=130.0s)]
*  So helicopters primarily drop the water. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=133.72s)]
*  And their goal is to slow the fire down enough [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=136.24s)]
*  to let crews to get in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=139.72s)]
*  Aircraft provide two, excuse me, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=142.4s)]
*  fixed wing aircraft provide two different elements. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=144.24s)]
*  So the retardant can be used directly on the line [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=146.6s)]
*  to slow the fire down so crews can get in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  But it also is designed to create areas, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=152.32s)]
*  like say on the ridge is where you saw that aircraft just [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=155.72s)]
*  drop right now, to be able to create a line that the fire [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=158.08s)]
*  won't be able to get past. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=162.12s)]
*  So it is a combination of direct and indirect attack. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=164.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=168.28s)]
*  So I was looking at the evacuation zone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=168.76s)]
*  I don't know if we have that map that we can put up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  But just with a little bit of a working knowledge [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  of Southern California, what I saw [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=175.72s)]
*  when it comes to the Palisades fire [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=177.08s)]
*  is that it's approaching essentially 101, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=178.88s)]
*  it looks like, on the northern side. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=181.24s)]
*  And 405, these are highways on the eastern side. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=183.28s)]
*  One, do those highways provide you a natural firebreak [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=187.32s)]
*  that helps in fighting the fire? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=190.84s)]
*  Two, they also represent those highways' population centers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=192.52s)]
*  So are those real concerns for you? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  That would be, I would assume, on the 101, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=198.04s)]
*  like Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Over at the 405, you're talking about Brentwood, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=202.04s)]
*  places like that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=203.88s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right on both points. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=206.32s)]
*  They can be a firebreak, especially [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=208.92s)]
*  when we have relatively low winds, 5, 10 miles an hour. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=211.28s)]
*  They're great firebreaks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  But they're also population centers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=217.0s)]
*  Now, when we have 60 to 100 mile per hour winds, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=219.32s)]
*  like we saw on Tuesday and Wednesday, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  that's just simply not going to be sufficient, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=225.56s)]
*  which is why we struggled so early on this fire, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=228.2s)]
*  because it was just blowing so incredibly fast. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=231.04s)]
*  OK, last question for you before we go, Chief. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  I asked you what you have available to you today. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=236.24s)]
*  Is it satisfactory for what you need to fight these fires? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=238.52s)]
*  You know, I don't want to push you into the blame game [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=242.28s)]
*  unless you feel like it's warranted. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=244.68s)]
*  But if you look back on how prepared you guys were, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=246.2s)]
*  what was made available to you in the beginning [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=248.88s)]
*  stages of these fires, do you feel like you were best served [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=251.4s)]
*  to fight these fires from the authorities in terms of water [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=255.08s)]
*  and everything else you need? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, actually we did. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=262.32s)]
*  We moved a number of resources from Cal Fire from the north [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=263.56s)]
*  because they have sufficient rain and snow up there, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=267.44s)]
*  all the way down to Southern California to prepare. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=269.92s)]
*  We didn't know where the fires were going to be. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  So that as soon as we did have a fire breakout, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  we immediately engaged. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  OK, David Acuna, California Fire Chief, Battalion Chief. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=278.76s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=283.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=285.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTt7GiC8t34&t=286.44s)]
