# Constitutional expert dismantles Democrats' democracy 'panic' over electing Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE)
*  The media and Democrats continuing their fear campaign over former President Trump as we [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=0.0s)]
*  reach the final two weeks before the election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=5.14s)]
*  Yes, I do believe that Donald Trump is unstable, increasingly unstable, and unfit to serve. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=8.44s)]
*  The fact of the matter is this is a dangerous person, this is a stupid person, and that's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  a bad combination. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=22.32s)]
*  This is somebody who wants unchecked power. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=23.32s)]
*  We do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=29.78s)]
*  Donald Trump is the stupidest and most dangerous presidential candidate in history. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=37.22s)]
*  He is a menace to democracy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=43.1s)]
*  He's threatening to sick troops on protesters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=45.5s)]
*  He's a genuine threat to our democracy, and that's not hyperbole. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=48.86s)]
*  That is a God's truth. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=53.38s)]
*  That was all about Joe's campaign from the get-go. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=56.42s)]
*  But Jonathan Charlie, the law professor, points out in a brand new op-ed in the New York Post, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=60.1s)]
*  the voters just aren't buying it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=64.46s)]
*  And Jonathan joins us right now from Ohio. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=66.22s)]
*  Good morning to you, Professor. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=68.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=70.98s)]
*  Hi, Steve. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=71.98s)]
*  In that little soundbite montage, they're pulling out all the stops. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=72.98s)]
*  You elect Donald Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=76.92s)]
*  It's the end of America as we know it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=78.14s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=81.42s)]
*  There are panic politics with sort of a Halloween flair that something wicked this way comes. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=82.42s)]
*  And if you vote against me, you are voting against democracy and life as you know it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=87.86s)]
*  What's missing from this is any sense of history and any sense of constitutional law. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=94.18s)]
*  For over two centuries, we have the oldest and most stable democratic system in the history [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=99.76s)]
*  of the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=105.88s)]
*  We have gone through wars and economic crises and social crises, and we're still here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=107.0s)]
*  It's a system designed to last because we have overlapping safeguards and checks and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=112.4s)]
*  balances and a tripartite system. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  All of that has to fail for these dire apocalyptic predictions to come true. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  And what's dangerous about this is that the panic politics is designed to distract voters, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  to say that no matter what else is bothering you, vote for your own life because you're [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=133.12s)]
*  looking at the end of democracy and your way of life unless Harris is elected. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=144.06s)]
*  And this was the theme when it was Joe Biden. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=145.06s)]
*  The campaign said, OK, we've got January 6. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=148.14s)]
*  We're going to remind people about January 6. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=151.62s)]
*  And they have done that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  And much to their horror, there's a, Jonathan, there's a brand new Washington Post poll that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  came out in the last week or so. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=160.62s)]
*  Who would do a better job against threats to democracy in the United States? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=162.38s)]
*  Donald Trump is actually beating Kamala Harris. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  And that could be one of the reasons why she's going to make her closing argument on Tuesday [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=169.8s)]
*  at the ellipse. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=175.16s)]
*  And she's going to say, and this is where Donald Trump stood on January 6. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=176.36s)]
*  And we know what happened that day. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=180.68s)]
*  That's what she's going to say. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  And what's interesting, Steve, is that an earlier poll when Joe Biden was still the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  nominee had the same result that they thought that Trump rather than Biden would be a better [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=187.8s)]
*  protection of the democracy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  And the problem here is that the American people have an innate sense of when they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=196.18s)]
*  being played for chumps. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=200.74s)]
*  It's not that the decision is easy for them between Trump and Harris, but they don't buy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  it. They don't buy that after this long two centuries of successful democracy, it's all [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=207.74s)]
*  going to come to an end unless Harris is elected president. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=212.62s)]
*  And but they're doubling down because this is the only thing they want to talk about. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=217.22s)]
*  They're going to try to win an election based on abject fear with a mix of illusory joy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=221.66s)]
*  And so far, that hasn't tracked with the voters. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  But as a legal matter, it borders on constitutional defamation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=231.78s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of complaints you can make about our system. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=236.74s)]
*  But the one thing you can recommend it is we're still here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=239.94s)]
*  It's a system designed by James Madison to last. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=243.5s)]
*  And, you know, when Obama says he's going to get unchecked power, you're left scratching [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=247.02s)]
*  your head. We have a system of checks and balances. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=252.9s)]
*  We have a tripartite system that is designed to prevent that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=255.5s)]
*  Where's all that going to go? Where are all the judges and members of Congress going to go [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=259.54s)]
*  when tyranny takes its hold because Harris is not elected president? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=264.42s)]
*  All right, professor, thank you very much for putting it exactly like that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29DWUXB3ZEE&t=269.5s)]
