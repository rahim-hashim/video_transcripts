# Gabbard: There is something ‘much darker’ going on here
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM)
*  Trump transition team co-chair Tulsi Gabbard has been on a tear through the country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=0.0s)]
*  campaigning for Donald Trump in battleground and blue strongholds. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=5.44s)]
*  In the last two weeks she's visited more than a dozen states reaching out to Democrats who are [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  disaffected with Kamala Harris. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Here to tell us what she's seeing and hearing on the ground is Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=15.3s)]
*  Tulsi, so great to have you on this morning. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=19.92s)]
*  Good morning, good to see you. Thank you so much. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=22.64s)]
*  So it's been fascinating to see how the Trump campaign is being very strategic about how they're [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=24.96s)]
*  using you and RFK and deploying you out to places that are blue like in Wisconsin in that Madison [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=29.2s)]
*  area. But you've been doing that you've been with the campaign for for quite a while. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=36.32s)]
*  What have you been seeing and what kinds of things have been changing as you've gone along [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=40.8s)]
*  in these months on the campaign? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=46.8s)]
*  Well there's a lot of energy building that's for sure and it's palpable on the ground. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=50.8s)]
*  I just want to share some of the really incredible and unique experiences we've had [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=54.72s)]
*  that event that we just held in Madison, Wisconsin a few days ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=58.88s)]
*  At every one of these events that I've been doing with Bobby Kennedy I asked the audience [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=63.36s)]
*  raise your hand if you're a Democrat or a former Democrat and in almost every event [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=68.08s)]
*  somewhere between you know 35 to 50 percent of the room will raise their hand. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  It was no different in Madison. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  The cool thing was this though when when their hands went up there's probably a couple thousand [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  people in the hall there the rest of the audience started to turn around and look around [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=84.8s)]
*  and they all stood up and cheered and welcomed them and just surrounded them really with love [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=89.44s)]
*  and kindness and I had so many people come up to me at the end of that saying I came in here afraid. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=96.24s)]
*  I've never been to a political rally before. I didn't know what to expect. I'm a Democrat, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=101.92s)]
*  lifelong Democrat, never voted before. Different variations of this but each walking out saying [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=106.24s)]
*  I'm voting for Donald Trump because of what I experienced here today. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=111.28s)]
*  You know Tulsi when Mark Cuban says Donald Trump doesn't like to surround himself with smart, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=116.08s)]
*  intelligent, independent women it's hard not to see that's a direct shot at Kellyanne Conway, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=121.28s)]
*  Kayleigh McEnany, Linda McMahon, a whole host of other women as well including you Tulsi. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=126.64s)]
*  It seems like it's a direct shot at someone like you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=132.64s)]
*  You know there's actually something much darker that he is implying there because the premise of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  his statement is that he believes that Liz Cheney and female warmongers like her are what defines [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=141.04s)]
*  strong women. They are hypocrites and cowards because when you look at people like Liz Cheney [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  she is eager to send our troops into harm's way. She is eager to advocate for more stupid wars [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=156.64s)]
*  for more stupid wars but she and other warmongers like her will never volunteer to put their lives [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=162.72s)]
*  on the line for these military adventures they're advocating in. I just finished a couple of days of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=169.12s)]
*  Army Reserve duty at Fort Sill Oklahoma and yesterday morning I stood there on the graduation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=174.24s)]
*  field and saw a few hundred brand new soldiers graduating from basic training, probably a thousand [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  family members there to celebrate them and it was so moving and I was thinking about people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=186.64s)]
*  like Liz Cheney when I was watching them because these are the young men and women who will pay [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=192.32s)]
*  the price potentially with their lives if people like Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney and Kamala Harris are [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=198.88s)]
*  allowed to be in power. This is one of the many reasons why I'm so strongly advocating for and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=204.64s)]
*  supporting for President Trump to go back to the White House to end wars not start them. Exactly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=210.4s)]
*  right the closer you are to it the more serious you should be about how you utilize those young [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  souls. Tulsi real quick where are you going in the closing days where would you be hitting the trail [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=219.12s)]
*  on behalf of the campaign? We got we got about 72 hours until election day I was just looking at [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  the schedule I will be in Georgia later today Pennsylvania Wisconsin Michigan and North Carolina [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=228.56s)]
*  before Monday night. Before Monday night. All right here we go. Well thanks for being with us this morning [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=236.16s)]
*  Tulsi we appreciate you. Thank you so much. Good to see you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi0DBhwLoM&t=240.88s)]
