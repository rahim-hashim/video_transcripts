*  was okay for them to wreck their property at their school. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=75.92s)]
*  They were they okayed it. Yeah, vandalize, burglarize, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=79.36s)]

*  understand that it hasn't happened since 1900 with Theodore [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=116.64s)]
*  Roosevelt. But you know what? It's gotten to an extreme [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=119.52s)]
*  situation. She should remove him. So, Hucho Mayor Adam [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=122.16s)]
*  says, let's be clear. None of this is acceptable. Is in fact [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=125.12s)]
*  despicable. New York City will always be a place where people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=128.56s)]

*  not tolerate violence, trespassing, menacing or threatening hate [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=134.0s)]
*  has no place in our or whatever your thoughts about him saying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=138.0s)]
*  something that those platitudes. It's nothing. It's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=141.68s)]
*  worth it. It's a platitude. You said it. He's doing nothing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=144.64s)]
*  about it. This is the definition. I can't believe I'm [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=147.52s)]
*  saying this in 2025. When my grandmother survived this, this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=150.56s)]
*  is a pogrom. A program doesn't just have to be the government [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=154.64s)]
*  doing stuff. It could be allowing stuff. You know what? I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=157.28s)]
*  heard that Chuck Schumer's Jewish. I heard he wrote a book [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=159.76s)]
*  about fighting anti-Semitism. Yeah. Do you hear him weighing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=162.56s)]
*  in on any of this? It takes the president to clamp down on [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=165.68s)]
*  places like Columbia and Barnard, but nothing from New [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=169.6s)]
*  Yorkers, New York leaders. People like Chuck Schumer should [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=172.88s)]
*  be ashamed of themselves and they cause more damage than they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=176.0s)]
*  actually claim to assist them. And Jeff, you just told me [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=180.4s)]
*  something so important for people out there watching this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  This is anti-Western, anti-American, anti-cop. Forget [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=185.44s)]
*  judge's ice. They're anti-cop. They're screaming in cops faces. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=190.24s)]
*  So that attitude we thought we left five years ago is still [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=193.84s)]
*  there with the next generation of New Yorkers. Final thought. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  The Jews are just a step on the way. What is their mantra? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=200.88s)]
*  They're also saying abolish the police, abolish ice, abolish [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=203.84s)]
*  capitalism. That is a huge part. That's the next step. It [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=207.52s)]
*  starts with the Jews. It ends with everything else in Western [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=211.68s)]
*  culture. Jeff, Jeff Lax will not be, we'll be relentless in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=214.56s)]
*  fighting back against this. Absolutely. And so are you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=217.52s)]
*  Absolutely. And so, so is the president. He's not giving up. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=220.08s)]
*  Just ask Harvard. They know what the God bless them. They [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=222.72s)]
*  know his wrath. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nggsBdyJusM&t=225.35999999999999s)]
