# Pelosi’s fingerprints ‘at the crime scene’ of Biden 2024 ouster: New book
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M)
*  A new book reveals what was really happening behind the scenes during the 2024 election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=0.0s)]
*  including how former President Obama was working against Kamala Harris. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=4.4s)]
*  One excerpt explains, quote, in private conversations, Obama flat out told allies Harris would lose [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=9.44s)]
*  to Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=14.38s)]
*  He did not think she should be the candidate, said one confidant. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=15.38s)]
*  He liked the idea of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer at the top of the ticket and Maryland [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=18.86s)]
*  Governor Wes Moore at the bottom. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  He didn't want a coronation of Harris. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=25.18s)]
*  The co-author of that book, Fight Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House, Jonathan [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=28.3s)]
*  Allen, joins us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=32.9s)]
*  Hey, Jonathan, it's so good to see you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=34.26s)]
*  Wish we were doing this in person. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=36.7s)]
*  But congratulations on the book. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  It's been a fun read. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=41.18s)]
*  It's like eating popcorn with lots of salt and butter. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=42.58s)]
*  You can't just eat a couple of kernels. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=45.94s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Charlie. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=47.7s)]
*  It's good to see you too. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  I hope folks that watch this show appreciate just how dogged a reporter you were as a print [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=51.5s)]
*  reporter for many years before you came to TV. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=57.54s)]
*  I've known you, I think, about 20 years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=60.7s)]
*  It has been a long time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=62.7s)]
*  Climbing the halls of Congress. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=65.46s)]
*  So I was particularly struck by, you know, for a lot of people, you know, during the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=67.22s)]
*  twenty twenty four campaign, there's a lot of speculation about what people thought was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=70.9s)]
*  going on behind the scenes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=74.62s)]
*  It's pretty dramatic because your reporting bears out that that they that they really [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=76.82s)]
*  were lost behind the scenes. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=82.22s)]
*  At one point, you actually had the Biden campaign hiding internal polling from their own campaign [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=84.06s)]
*  in different states. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=92.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great find that you've got there, Charlie, that not anybody's really [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=93.94s)]
*  talked about since this book came out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=100.26s)]
*  But absolutely true. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  The state directors in these big, important swing states for months were not seeing internal [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=104.34s)]
*  polling before even before the Biden Trump debate. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=109.66s)]
*  The campaign leadership was not telling the people on the ground where the race stood. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=114.06s)]
*  And the reason for that, the biggest reason for that was that Trump was already beating [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=118.14s)]
*  Biden and the leadership of the Democratic Party, the most senior Democrats were aware of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=122.82s)]
*  that. It's one of the reasons that they wanted Biden to debate Trump early. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  They wanted so badly to shake up a race that Trump was already going to win, looking for a way [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=131.78s)]
*  to shake it up. And they did shake it up, just not in the way they hoped. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And I was also struck that, you know, we're so used to, you know, so many people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=140.5s)]
*  sort of holding up Obama as being sort of this political almost deity. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=145.94s)]
*  But it's interesting how, you know, he kind of missed on a lot of this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  I would argue he kind of missed when he picked Joe Biden to be his vice president, because [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=156.1s)]
*  it's not much of a legacy for him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=160.94s)]
*  But his his efforts behind the scenes, not only was he trying to undermine Kamala Harris, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=163.42s)]
*  but ultimately he ended up failing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  That's right. You know, and more than failing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  So he tried his best to have some sort of mini primary or open convention. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=175.5s)]
*  And we've got a scene in the book where even after Joe Biden has decided that he's going to get out, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=179.98s)]
*  has decided that he's going to endorse Kamala Harris, Obama has phone calls set up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=185.61999999999998s)]
*  He has one set up with Jim Clyburn, the congressman from South Carolina, to talk about, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=191.14s)]
*  well, at least Clyburn expected Obama to talk to him about an open convention. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=196.17999999999998s)]
*  But Clyburn pushed out his own endorsement so that by the time he talked to Obama, he could say, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  look, we just have to get get behind Kamala Harris here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=206.1s)]
*  I've already endorsed her. I don't really need to hear anything about your open primary idea. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  But not only did it fail, but I think it backfired on Obama. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=214.94s)]
*  I think it really strained his relationships and it exposed his diminished influence within the Democratic Party. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=219.38s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. I was also struck like during the debate, which was obviously a catastrophe for Joe Biden [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=225.42s)]
*  when Joe Biden was still in the race. You had people like Chris Coons, who is, you know, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=231.22s)]
*  Joe Biden's, you know, number one emissary in the Senate in the book, kind of surprised or pretending to be surprised. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=236.7s)]
*  I don't know which it is that Joe Biden was so bad off. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=247.1s)]
*  And you would think this is a fellow Delawarean. You would think, you know, you would think of somebody who knew [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=250.98s)]
*  that that Biden's cheese had slid off his cracker. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=256.14s)]
*  Chris Coons would have known. But there he is professing that he didn't have any idea how bad off Joe Biden was. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=259.06s)]
*  I was kind of surprised by all that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=265.54s)]
*  Yeah, what a great metaphor that she's sliding off the cracker, Charlie. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=267.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think, look, Coons definitely spent time with Biden in a way that a lot of senators and members of the House did not. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  But it's also true that the White House staff and the Biden family kept even his close allies at a little bit of a distance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=279.66s)]
*  There was a really tight cocoon around Biden. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=287.3s)]
*  But Coons also knew that he wasn't going to be the first person and that he would be the last person to abandon Biden. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=289.98s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  He's kind of playing a role on debate night. He's getting all these texts from senators who are like, well, they're basically saying, what the heck? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=298.18s)]
*  Why haven't you told us about this? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  And Coons' first thought is, I have to be the cleanup crew for Joe Biden. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=307.5s)]
*  No matter what I think of that debate, I have to be the cleanup crew for him. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=311.98s)]
*  So, you know, Coons starts pushing back on all his fellow senators. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  He says, you know, chill out. It's just a bad moment. It wasn't that bad. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=319.54s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, he watched the debate. He's got two eyes like the rest of us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't just a debacle politically for Joe Biden. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=326.74s)]
*  It was a scary moment for the country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=329.34s)]
*  He's the leader of the free world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=330.78s)]
*  The guy with his finger on the nuclear button. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=332.7s)]
*  Breath of coherent thought. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=335.02s)]
*  And one of the values of a book like yours is the fact that it does it pulls back the curtain because I want to play a quick piece of tape showing just how much at that time, in real time, Democrats were denying all of these concerns. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=336.82s)]
*  Any aide who engages with him or reporters, we can see this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=353.82s)]
*  The gears of his mind are working. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  And Biden is actually in good shape. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=359.85999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden has 50 years of experience in foreign policy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=362.7s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=365.94s)]
*  And he is strong. He is strong behind doors and he's strong when he's in front of the camera. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  He's clearly up to the job. He's doing it every day. He's doing it successfully. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=371.26s)]
*  His mental acuity is great. It's fine. It's as good as it's been over the years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  He is as sharp as ever. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=379.26s)]
*  It's kind of jarring, especially when you read your book now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=380.9s)]
*  Well, I mean, especially with Schumer there saying that his mental acuity is as good as it's been for years. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=385.26s)]
*  You wonder what those previous years were. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=392.9s)]
*  Yeah. So that which leads me actually to a whole another part of the book that I thought was really interesting. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=394.9s)]
*  There's a lot of jockeying between Pelosi, even though Pelosi has sort of moved into the background of leadership. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  Schumer is still very much in leadership. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of jockeying. And I'm going to read a quick quote from the book. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=411.02000000000004s)]
*  When Democratic insiders put out a contract on Biden's political life, Pelosi executed the hit. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=414.58000000000004s)]
*  Schumer did not want Pelosi to get all the credit for pushing Biden out to the side as soon as he as it looked like Harris had a chance to win. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=420.54s)]
*  He started telling reporters in August that he played a crucial role behind the scenes in urging Biden to get out. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=430.5s)]
*  So going forward, you've got this kind of this, you know, obviously an ugly thing from the past, but also this rivalry now between a former leadership Pelosi and current leadership Schumer. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=437.46000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, how is that bridge going to going to heal? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=453.42s)]
*  I mean, the fascinating thing about that, that part that you just pulled out there, Charlie, is Nancy Pelosi's fingerprints are absolutely at the crime scene. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=458.74s)]
*  If you will, pushing pushing by now at night, I think she was representing what Democrats thought was right and a lot of other people thought was right. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=467.34000000000003s)]
*  The Biden, you know, was not capable of running. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=475.1s)]
*  I think there were a lot of Americans who thought he was not capable of continuing in office as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=477.54s)]
*  But Pelosi didn't want that to be the outcome. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=482.1s)]
*  I mean, it hurt her to be the person wielding the knife, whereas Schumer is taking a victory lap for his role. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=485.38s)]
*  And there's a real conflict in just sort of the way they approach these things. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=493.42s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, I doubt there are very many of your viewers that think Chuck Schumer is a more effective politician or strategist than Nancy Pelosi is. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=496.3s)]
*  And it's been sort of funny to watch him trying to take credit for something that didn't work and that, you know, turned him against some of his old friends. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=504.58s)]
*  And Pelosi, of course, is still occasionally taking those subtle velvet hammer shots at Schumer, which always make me laugh. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=513.82s)]
*  Jonathan Allen, fine book that you and Amy put together. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=524.5s)]
*  And congratulations. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=528.6999999999999s)]
*  It's obviously going going all over. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=530.6199999999999s)]
*  And thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=535.2199999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much, Charlie. Good to see it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_vTDsPA6M&t=538.38s)]
