# Trump tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China to go into effect at midnight
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg)
*  Tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, which are set to take effect at midnight tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow will be tariff Tuesday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=6.04s)]
*  But our North American allies are now vowing to strike back. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=7.96s)]
*  Fox Business reporter Lydia Hu has more for us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=11.84s)]
*  Hey Lydia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=14.92s)]
*  Hey, good morning there guys. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=15.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=16.92s)]
*  President Trump is making good on a campaign promise imposing tariffs that start tomorrow [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=17.92s)]
*  on our biggest trading partners. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=22.32s)]
*  Imports from Canada and Mexico will face a 25% tariff, with Canadian Energy facing a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=25.2s)]
*  10% levy, and imports from China will have a 10% tariff. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=31.0s)]
*  Some warn that these tariffs could mean higher prices for consumers, but President Trump [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=35.8s)]
*  said yesterday it will be worth it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  You may have short term some little pain and people understand that, but long term the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=51.56s)]
*  We have deficits with almost every country, not every country, but almost. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=56.2s)]
*  And we're going to change it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  It's been unfair. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, Canadian officials are calling the tariffs economic warfare. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=64.12s)]
*  Action is utter madness. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  It is a betrayal of America's closest friend, of your ally, your neighbor, your best partner [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  in the whole world. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=81.38s)]
*  It is an act of economic warfare. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=83.86s)]
*  The United States imports more than $1.4 trillion worth of goods and services from these three [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=87.5s)]
*  countries. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=93.26s)]
*  That's according to the Congressional Research Service. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=94.26s)]
*  These products include everyday essentials like crude oil, cars and auto parts from Canada. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=96.66s)]
*  We import trucks, computers and electronics from Mexico and cell phones, toys and clothing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=102.94s)]
*  from China. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=108.58s)]
*  Retaliation is promised. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=109.74s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau already announced a 25 percent tear off on roughly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  $170 billion worth of U.S. goods. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  That's ranging from cosmetics to beverages, lumbers and plastics. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=120.74s)]
*  And the Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum, she's also set to announce tariffs today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  So we're standing by for that information. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=128.66s)]
*  And finally, China is pledging to initiate a case against the United States with the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=130.74s)]
*  World Trade Organization. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=134.82s)]
*  All of these countermeasures would come despite Trump's promise to increase tariffs further [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=136.98s)]
*  if retaliation is taken against American goods. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see how all of that unfolds, guys. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  And Lydia, we're starting to see how it's unfolding around the world. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=149.42s)]
*  When you look at the global markets, Taiwan is down three and a half percent, Tokyo and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=152.42s)]
*  Seoul down two and a half percent. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  Oil prices are rising. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  I think they're up about two bucks a barrel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  And the VIX, which essentially is the fear index of Wall Street, is up 20 percent. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=163.82s)]
*  So investors don't know what to make of this tariff business. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that really seems to be the case. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=173.98s)]
*  It's injecting a lot of uncertainty into the markets. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=176.38s)]
*  And the markets never like that type of uncertainty. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=180.06s)]
*  But I think it's also important to remind everyone why President Trump is doing this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=182.42s)]
*  This is about the flow of illegal migration and drugs. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=186.74s)]
*  And he is committed to stop those two scourges on the United States, saying these tariffs [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=190.74s)]
*  will remain in place until our borders are secure and illegal drugs stop flowing into [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=199.46s)]
*  So Lydia, what specifically does he want from these countries? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=200.46s)]
*  He wants them to enforce the borders, close the borders, and when they do that, then he'll [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=202.78s)]
*  lift the tariffs? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=207.34s)]
*  That's what the White House has indicated, Ainsley. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=208.8s)]
*  He says he wants zero deaths from fentanyl. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=210.78s)]
*  And just in the past week, you know, I spent time up at the Canadian border in the province [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=213.58s)]
*  to observe for myself what Canadian officials are doing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=218.5s)]
*  They insist that their border on the North is closed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=221.62s)]
*  And Canada, excuse me, Mexico, we understand, is also working with the Trump administration. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  So we'll see how soon they can address these issues. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=229.38000000000002s)]
*  You know what's interesting, Lydia, over the weekend, Washington state congresswoman who [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=231.38000000000002s)]
*  was on another channel, and they say, you know, aren't the tariffs bad? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=234.34s)]
*  And she said, well, when it comes to lumber, we have enough lumber. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=238.02s)]
*  We would love to start using our forests to be the lumber supplier for America, but [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=242.34s)]
*  there's too many restrictions on it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=248.06s)]
*  If you couple the lumber tariffs with allowing us to use our own forests, I'm okay with it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=250.02s)]
*  And it made me think in the big picture, is this a reconfiguring to try to get America [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=257.9s)]
*  to use American products here in America, from oil to gas to lumber that we have to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=263.06s)]
*  our automobiles? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=270.38s)]
*  And wouldn't that build up to middle class? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=271.92s)]
*  You can't say that because the reason why we have a special dispensation to do this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=273.76s)]
*  is a 1977 law that said in case of emergency, you could put on tariffs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=280.04s)]
*  The emergency is fentanyl and it's real. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=285.04s)]
*  But essentially underneath, is it the bigger picture to start making stuff here again? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=287.88s)]
*  I think that is spot on, Brian. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=294.04s)]
*  I mean, when you look at all of the restrictions we have, take oil and energy production, for [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=295.8s)]
*  example, our North American Free Trade Agreement has been in existence for decades, but what [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=300.84s)]
*  that's allowed the United States to do is rely on production from other places like [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=305.12s)]
*  Canada. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=309.44s)]
*  And what we think about when we reconfigure how free trade could flow, maybe this could [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=310.44s)]
*  be a return to producing more in the United States and ensuring our energy dominance. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=314.56s)]
*  Lydia, final question. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=320.2s)]
*  I think when Donald Trump was talking about tariffs during the campaign, investors and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=322.24s)]
*  people in general, people up on Capitol Hill, thought essentially that he's talking about [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=327.52s)]
*  tariffs to negotiate something to get from both the countries. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=333.32s)]
*  Well his trade people aren't even in place. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=338.4s)]
*  The Commerce Secretary hadn't even been confirmed yet. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=340.0s)]
*  So he's doing this before that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=342.96s)]
*  And the worry is that along the way, Americans could get hurt. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=346.4s)]
*  I mean, you look at, he's going to put a 10% tariff on Canadian crude oil. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  Two weeks ago he declared an energy emergency. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=357.08s)]
*  Looks like the cost of driving the car is going to go a little up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=360.52s)]
*  But I'm really worried about America's farmers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=364.24s)]
*  As a former Future Farmer of America president in Clay County, Kansas, I can tell you that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=366.2s)]
*  the biggest exports are to Mexico and China from America's farmers. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=371.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=376.24s)]
*  It reminds me of a recent headline that I saw in the New York Times where some Trump [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=377.24s)]
*  campaign, excuse me, Trump administration advisors were reportedly encouraging the president [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=381.8s)]
*  to enforce and bring about and act these tariffs first and negotiate later. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=387.24s)]
*  So one thing I'm looking for, Steve, is to see how much we can move away from maybe these [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=392.64s)]
*  heightened levels of 25% and discourage any type of retaliatory measures being taken against [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=398.12s)]
*  our American farmers. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  One thing I would draw our attention to is the fact that when President Trump was first [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=405.96s)]
*  talking about the tariffs, he was calling for a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=409.68s)]
*  What do we get? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  Ten. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  It does seem like he is keeping the American consumer in mind. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=419.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, Joe Biden left all the tariffs in place. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=420.0s)]
*  If they were so bad, why did he leave them there? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=422.28s)]
*  Lydia, thanks so much. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  We'll check in again. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRYfvCUcidg&t=435.96s)]
