# Biden did exactly what he accused Trump of doing: Devine
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw)
*  So could Biden's brother James be next on the pardon list? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's ask New York Post columnist and the author of The Big Guy, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=4.48s)]
*  President and his son sold out America, Miranda Devine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  So Miranda, I mean, this is just nonsense. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=11.16s)]
*  Now he believes that the Department of Justice [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=13.64s)]
*  is corrupt only against his son. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=15.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Lawrence. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=21.44s)]
*  Yes, it is ridiculous. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=23.0s)]
*  And it is his own Department of Justice [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=24.76s)]
*  that he successfully weaponised against his political opponent, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=27.72s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=32.12s)]
*  So he can't have it both ways. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=33.2s)]
*  In fact, the bias in the Department of Justice [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=35.44s)]
*  went only one way, and that was towards protecting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=40.2s)]
*  Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=44.28s)]
*  And we know that without a doubt because of two honourable [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=46.08s)]
*  public servants called Gary Shapley and Joe Ziegler, who [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=49.96s)]
*  were the IRS investigators who had the terrible task [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=53.32s)]
*  of investigating Hunter Biden for a whole slew of crimes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=57.32s)]
*  for five years in Delaware. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=62.12s)]
*  And they have testified to Congress when they came out [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=64.36s)]
*  as whistleblowers that they were obstructed every step of the way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=67.4s)]
*  It was favourable treatment towards Hunter Biden. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=72.16s)]
*  And also any investigative trail that led to Joe Biden [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=75.28s)]
*  and to his role in the family's corrupt dealings, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=79.76s)]
*  they were blocked from pursuing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=83.76s)]
*  So Joe Biden is, as usual, saying the opposite of the fact. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=85.84s)]
*  He is the very embodiment of what he accuses Donald Trump of being. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=91.64s)]
*  So do you think the brother is next? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=97.2s)]
*  He has to pardon the brother too, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=99.68s)]
*  Yeah, look, I'm sure there will be a lot of people [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  that Joe Biden pardons. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  And anybody that could possibly testify against his family, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  there are former business partners. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=113.32s)]
*  There are also, I mean, even people you think about like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=116.36s)]
*  Anthony Fauci or anybody that he perceives that the Republicans [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  might want to bring to account over their wrongdoing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=125.36s)]
*  during his administration. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=129.28s)]
*  Yeah, so unfortunate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=132.32s)]
*  Hopefully we get to the bottom of this, though, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  in the next administration, what truly happened. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  Miranda Devine, you've been on this story [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=139.4s)]
*  before anybody else was. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=141.92s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=144.0s)]
*  Thanks, Lawrence. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUPbL3DfwTw&t=147.04s)]
