# Atlanta voters torn on 2024 race: 'I don't need a handout'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0)
*  in the swing state of Georgia this week you got a new poll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=0.0s)]
*  that has Trump leading Harris by 4 percentage points in the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=12.74s)]
*  Pete state with the later journal Constitution being the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=16.02s)]
*  author. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=19.14s)]
*  It also shows about 74% of black voters in Georgia would [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=20.42s)]
*  vote for Harris. A drop from the 87% Biden received in 2020. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=23.96s)]
*  I went to Atlanta to talk to some of these men [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=29.22s)]
*  as part of our exclusive Barbershop Talks series. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=31.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=33.86s)]
*  What would you say is the state of the community right now? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=36.1s)]
*  Oh man, right now the state of the community is, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=39.5s)]
*  we're kind of in disarray. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  Disarray. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  Yes, we want to know what's going to happen in November. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=44.86s)]
*  If the election were held today, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=49.54s)]
*  who do y'all think is going to win? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=50.82s)]
*  I think Trump, but. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=52.46s)]
*  It's going to be close. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=54.58s)]
*  In here, we've seen more people leaning towards Kamala Harris. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=56.94s)]
*  It's not about the person, right? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=65.74s)]
*  I've never fallen in love with a personality. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=68.14s)]
*  If you look at my history of voting, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=73.62s)]
*  even this most current one, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=75.62s)]
*  it's not down the line blue all the time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=78.06s)]
*  It's not all red. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=80.58s)]
*  It's a mixture because I look at people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=82.62s)]
*  I pick who's best for the situation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=85.06s)]
*  What are you hearing from people right now? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=87.66s)]
*  A way for them to work for themselves. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=91.9s)]
*  And they want to pick the best candidate [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=94.42s)]
*  that allowed them to work for themselves. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=96.14s)]
*  And a lot of times you have people like my guy right here [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=99.54s)]
*  who's looking for an opportunity to start his own business. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  And he's telling me, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=107.94s)]
*  what president would actually help me the best? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=110.18s)]
*  So I'm telling him, I think, come on. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=113.7s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=116.58s)]
*  I voted for her and Biden last time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=117.42s)]
*  Okay, so you voted for Biden and you gave him a shot. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=121.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=122.62s)]
*  And my pockets hurt. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=123.46s)]
*  I don't want my pockets hurting. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=125.86s)]
*  I'm going to just go ahead and say it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to support Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=128.14s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=129.26s)]
*  but he gave us four years of peace and prosperity, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=130.7s)]
*  a secure border, no new wars. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  And one of the biggest things that speaks to me [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=137.22s)]
*  as a business owner is the border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=139.7s)]
*  Inflation, we have more dollars chasing less goods. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=143.98s)]
*  And an invasion also is another form of inflation [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=148.1s)]
*  because we have more people that are needing less products. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  What would you say is the number one issue [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=157.14s)]
*  facing black America right now? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=160.33999999999997s)]
*  Oh man, the number one issue I'd say facing black America [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=163.06s)]
*  is the trust, the trust of Washington DC. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=167.38s)]
*  Inflation is crazy hot right now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Interest rates are up and we just don't believe [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=175.98s)]
*  what's in office right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=179.7s)]
*  It's going to support us another four years. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=180.94s)]
*  I consider myself middle-class. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=184.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=185.54s)]
*  And I can relate to Ms. Harris a little bit more [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=186.38s)]
*  or a lot more, but at the same time, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=190.26s)]
*  I respect other people's opinion. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=193.26s)]
*  And with that being said, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=195.22s)]
*  the financial agenda that works best for me [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  is the one that's going to give me that $50,000 tax break [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=201.5s)]
*  if I should start another business [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=205.62s)]
*  or save me six to $7,000 on taxes during that year. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=207.46s)]
*  I'm not as in presenting a plan yet [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=212.9s)]
*  on what she's going to do. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=215.58s)]
*  All she's talked about is what she's going to give people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=216.74s)]
*  She's going to give people all this stuff. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=219.78s)]
*  We're going to give you a $25,000 tax credit by a house. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=221.3s)]
*  That's not enough for you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=226.78s)]
*  Well, it don't matter if you get these people $25,000. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=228.02s)]
*  They're not going to buy a house. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=233.22s)]
*  They're not going to do it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=234.74s)]
*  Everybody wants something for free. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=236.38s)]
*  That's what the Democrats think. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=239.9s)]
*  If we give you something, you'll vote for us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=241.46s)]
*  I don't need a handout. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  I need an opportunity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=246.5s)]
*  What is the number one issue folks talk about [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=247.86s)]
*  that's facing them in life? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=250.74s)]
*  Is it the economy? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=252.06s)]
*  Is it more jobs? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=253.66000000000003s)]
*  Sports. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=256.06s)]
*  No, really. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  That too. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=260.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=261.34s)]
*  But again, people come from all walks of life [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=262.34s)]
*  in this barbershop. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=267.34s)]
*  And that's the beauty of Georgia. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=268.18s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=269.26s)]
*  And that's beautiful. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  Any barbershop in America, that's true. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  So as you can see, it's split in Georgia [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=273.18s)]
*  and it's a tough race in Georgia as well. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  A lot of black businesses also there as well. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  I think the one thing that you can take away is, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=280.29999999999995s)]
*  and I continue to say this, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=282.58s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that the whole barbershop [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  is going to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=286.82s)]
*  I've never said that in any of the ones that we've covered. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=288.94s)]
*  But we've never seen this amount of black men [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=290.62s)]
*  supporting a Republican candidate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=293.74s)]
*  And I think that's why the alarm bells are going off. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  There's still some people in the barbershop [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=297.98s)]
*  that's gonna vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=299.22s)]
*  Yeah, and particularly the one guy who said, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=300.62s)]
*  look, the Democrats are gonna give you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=302.98s)]
*  as much stuff as they can to get your vote. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=306.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  Talking about the $25,000 to buy a house, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=309.38s)]
*  nobody's gonna buy a house. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=311.54s)]
*  They just want free stuff. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=312.66s)]
*  Also, people just can't afford it right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  Also, would you say that indicative of the passion, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=315.7s)]
*  Georgia's through the roof with early voting? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=318.5s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  Through the roof. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=321.06s)]
*  Remember Jim Crow 2.0? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=321.9s)]
*  It was supposed to be anti-minority. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=323.9s)]
*  They're trying to keep minorities from voting. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=326.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=329.38s)]
*  Tell that to the turnout in 2022, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=330.5s)]
*  and then you look at this in 2012. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  Not just that, Brian, but when they coined that phrase, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=334.18s)]
*  of course they were trying to link Brian Kim to that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=337.5s)]
*  His support among the black men after they did that doubled. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=339.82s)]
*  So I'm not sure it's working as well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=343.14s)]
*  Another poll that came out by the University of Chicago [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=345.22s)]
*  shows that a quarter of young black men are supporting Trump. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=347.66s)]
*  That's never happened before. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=350.18s)]
*  44% of young Latino men said they'll back Trump. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  So alarm bells are going off in the campaign. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  You always say the reason is because... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=357.38000000000005s)]
*  It's the economy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  The economy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=359.42s)]
*  It's the economy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=360.26000000000005s)]
*  You can scare people all day, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=361.1s)]
*  but people want to provide for their families. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=362.98s)]
*  They're just like any other demographic. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=364.54s)]
*  In the barbershop, you heard the guys say, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=365.54s)]
*  well, if you compare these last four years [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=367.54s)]
*  to where we were before, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=369.66s)]
*  I had more money in my bank account. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=370.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think that was the gentleman [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  that voted for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in the past. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=374.14000000000004s)]
*  So these aren't partisans. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  And at the barbershop itself, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  they've probably had to jack up prices [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  just because everything cost more. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  I think everything is going up. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=383.98s)]
*  I don't know, I can't speak to the prices [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=385.38s)]
*  at the barbershop there, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=387.94s)]
*  because I didn't ask them that, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  but I think everything is going up in some form of fashion. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=390.86s)]
*  Quick question, because you know, I go to a salon. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=394.1s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=396.18s)]
*  We got to change that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  Do they hit you with skin bracer after, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=397.86s)]
*  like, do they take some of that and just hit you on the side? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=400.02000000000004s)]
*  After a haircut? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  No, it's alcohol. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=402.98s)]
*  And they spray it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=405.14s)]
*  Oh, they spray it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=405.98s)]
*  Like in Home Alone? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=406.8s)]
*  Like in Home Alone? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=407.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=408.48s)]
*  If they don't, if it doesn't burn, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=409.82s)]
*  then you haven't gotten the real hair. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, really? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=412.98s)]
*  No, it needs to burn. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=413.82s)]
*  What's the purpose of that? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  Anti-septic. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=416.3s)]
*  To kill all the bacteria and all that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=417.42s)]
*  Good job. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=420.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=421.22s)]
*  Excellent trip down to Atlanta. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=422.06s)]
*  That was the last one. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqagUh6Fm0&t=423.94s)]
