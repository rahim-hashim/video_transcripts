# Trump declares 'justice for Laken Riley' following guilty verdict
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM)
*  So yesterday down in Athens, Georgia the judge took 20 minutes to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=0.0s)]
*  To sentence to find that guy right there Jose Barra guilty and then to sentence him this all happened so quickly [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=4.16s)]
*  He murdered Laken Riley back in February and then this case has already tried. He's already sentenced it happened very quickly [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=11.22s)]
*  Yesterday was very emotional Laken's stepfather her father her mother her sister [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=18.82s)]
*  I believe that's her sister in the striped sweatshirt or sweater her best friends [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=25.06s)]
*  They all spoke and they were talking about how chilly it is to be in the same room with the guy who took their sister [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=29.82s)]
*  Their loved ones life and as a mother to a little girl, I cannot imagine how Laken's mom feels [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=35.78s)]
*  She told the court she told Ibarra you took away my best friend [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=42.7s)]
*  And she talked about the fear that her daughter must have felt and that her daughter died alone [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=48.62s)]
*  Listen to this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=54.06s)]
*  There is no end to the pain suffering and loss that we have experienced or will continue to endure [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=56.54s)]
*  My precious daughter was attacked [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=64.02s)]
*  beaten and shown no mercy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=67.18s)]
*  She fought for a life and dignity and to save herself from being brutally raped [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=70.98s)]
*  This sick [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  twisted an evil coward [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=80.42s)]
*  Showed no regard for Laken or human life [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=83.36s)]
*  Your honor. I'm asking you to please give Jose Ibarra the same thing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=86.44s)]
*  He gave us when he made the choice to take Laken's life and destroy ours [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=91.06s)]
*  He showed no mercy on Laken when she was begging for her life [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=96.8s)]
*  No mercy and and it sounded like she wanted the death penalty. However, because there's a progressive DA down there [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=104.18s)]
*  He's only winding up with life in prison with no chance of parole [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=112.34s)]
*  Of course in the future that might change but there are lawmakers in Georgia who are calling on the Attorney General there [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=116.58000000000001s)]
*  To reverse that and intervene and demand the death penalty [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  That is Colton Moore says I'm calling on an attorney general to file an emergency motion intervene and demand the death penalty [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  For this killer convicted killer [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  And if you want to just know what we're up against that dispatch in a look from this gang member from that brutal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=136.38s)]
*  Venezuelan gang sat there in a plaid shirt listen to all this and had no remorse [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=141.78s)]
*  There's no remorse there that does no regret there [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=146.86s)]
*  It seems like we're bothering them by putting him on trial and we all got a quick look at the dangers at the border [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=149.54s)]
*  He can't marginalize what people are saying and come out with stats and say illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than legal [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=154.86s)]
*  Americans with their paperwork done because we know what they're capable of and every one of these murders or these rapes are all [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  preventable governor Brian Kemp [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  Wait in with Lawrence a short time ago [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=172.86s)]
*  This one hits close to home for us, you know, you know Marty and the girls and I live in Athens, Georgia [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=176.34s)]
*  We know the judge we know the deputy that was standing right there in the courtroom [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  We know the Phillips and Riley families our daughters a senior at the University of Georgia [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  And I mean even when I was on campus both Marty and I have been in the area where Lakin lost her life [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=192.14s)]
*  I can't tell you how many times [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=198.34s)]
*  It is a bittersweet day [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=201.1s)]
*  This is a tragic event as you and your colleagues have been saying never should have happened [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=202.82s)]
*  But it did because the bad policies of this administration [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=208.94s)]
*  Which is quite honestly outrageous [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=212.74s)]
*  But I am thankful that justice was swift here and the judge moved so quickly one thing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=215.06s)]
*  I think that people are missing with it. This case is trended at Agua, which is reportedly he's a part of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  They work within the prison system [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=226.5s)]
*  So we're putting them in prison to go back to people that are operating within the prison [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=228.74s)]
*  This is like a gift for him. This is why they need to evaluate the death penalty [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=234.18s)]
*  Are y'all gonna have him in an isolation? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  What's gonna happen because you may be turning him into the criminal enterprise where he can steal and invoke harm [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=240.38s)]
*  They communicate on the outside Europe. We know they're here. So I just don't understand the logic behind this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=247.0s)]
*  I know they want to reimagine the justice system, but that makes zero sense to me [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  I also think it's also important to understand that there was one person one president that called [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=257.38s)]
*  That got in touch with with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=263.82s)]
*  Lakin's family with Lakin's family and there's one that put out on truth social his feelings about the conviction and the sadness [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  He feels for the family as Donald Trump. You still don't have the Biden administration even responding to this no call [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=272.64s)]
*  But how about tone deafness yesterday launched a new ice app allowing illegals beginning of December to bypass [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=278.84s)]
*  in-person check-ins making it harder to track them and with the check-in you don't have to give up your [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=285.98s)]
*  Background you don't have to talk about if you have any outstanding warrants [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=291.8s)]
*  they have no way of checking if there's a as a warrant out for your arrest and a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  100,000 migrants are immediately immediately rolled in the first wave of the program [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  There's 58,000 illegals living in New York City. So he to the end is for the illegal immigrant [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=305.0s)]
*  That's his policy whether he knows it or not [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  You know what and being from the south like this whole East Coast. This is my world [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=314.28s)]
*  This is these are my people and this is our New York was always our Mecca when we grew up down south [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  If you got a chance to go to New York [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=324.2s)]
*  It was so fun to just go and see the lights in a show maybe [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=326.06s)]
*  So to know that this guy was right over here at the Roosevelt Hotel [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=328.86s)]
*  And then he left there and we paid for him to take a flight down to another beloved [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=332.58s)]
*  Area which is Georgia and live near the campus which is such an awesome campus in Athens [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=337.98s)]
*  UGA when we would go there when Carolina would play we would have so much fun in Athens [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=343.5s)]
*  This guy lived there and we were paying for him and his brother and they're a part of this gang and he goes into [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=347.46s)]
*  This part that looks like a beautiful park and he attacks this girl who's running like we all do or we all walk in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  The park and exercise it could have happened in Central Park could happen in this gorgeous park and he pulls her aside and he thinks [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=359.14s)]
*  because he wants to sleep with her and brutally attack her and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=365.02s)]
*  Please himself that he can just throw her on the ground and brutally attack her and try to have his way with her and then [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=369.46s)]
*  Bash her head in with a rock this guy's here illegal and all these governors that are from Democratic cities and they say oh well [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=375.08s)]
*  It happens sometimes and get over it and we're gonna be a sanctuary city. This could happen to your daughter, too [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=381.68s)]
*  This is your child and your life could change forever like Lake and Riley's family [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=387.28s)]
*  Well, they'll never be the same governor Healy and that's why Tom Homan was on last night. Governor Healy said [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=391.16s)]
*  Sometimes things happen. Yeah [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfhfKckvIM&t=397.36s)]
