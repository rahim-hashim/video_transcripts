# Trump Cabinet members react to first meeting: 'Trump understands THIS is key'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas)
*  All right, we've been telling you about President Trump hosting his first cabinet meeting of his second term at the White House yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=0.0s)]
*  And I was there in the room as the president took dozens of questions including mine and afterwards [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=6.16s)]
*  I got the opportunity to speak with some of the cabinet members watch [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=11.24s)]
*  We just wrapped up the first cabinet [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=15.0s)]
*  It was fired up in there [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=17.52s)]
*  We as a cabinet really all around the table you could probably feel it when you were in there [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=19.56s)]
*  You do the love and the respect and even though we're not gonna always agree on everything [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We all feel called to meet this moment President Trump is such a fantastic leader Lawrence [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=29.16s)]
*  You were in part of that meeting but he's got assembled an incredible cabinet [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=34.0s)]
*  He's given everybody clear direction through the executive orders, which are then [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=38.4s)]
*  directing those secretaries in the room to go out and enact his agenda so [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=43.08s)]
*  Everybody's talking about Doge and how is impacting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=48.2s)]
*  You guys's departments agencies as well. What's been the impact so far? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=52.64s)]
*  You know, we have a Doge task force at HUD and so we found 260 million dollars in savings and contracts [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=57.4s)]
*  For a million of that was in DEI contracts that were for cultural transformation [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=64.64s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the mission of HUD and also in addition to 1.9 billion dollars in misplaced funds [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=68.92s)]
*  And so, you know part of being servant leaders like Brooke and I and our cabinet colleagues is to be good stewards of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=74.44s)]
*  American taxpayer dollars. Well for me I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=81.2s)]
*  Encourage it I'm grateful for it. I mean it's never easy right anytime you're right sizing a ship you it is imperfect [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=85.08s)]
*  It can be painful [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=91.88s)]
*  but at the end of the day we have a commitment to the American people and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=92.88s)]
*  President Trump won a race not just an electoral race [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=96.72s)]
*  But we're gonna win a popular vote that the people wanted the government returned to them [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=99.86s)]
*  They wanted government off their back. They wanted to be able to self-govern again [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  we're going to right size this government for the American people talk about AG and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=107.84s)]
*  Directly how it's gonna be impacting the American people food security is national security Scottie and I are talking about rural prosperity [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=112.24s)]
*  Well, you can't have rural prosperity without a strong agriculture community and without rural housing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=118.88s)]
*  I've heard this from the 20 somethings in our country say hey, how am I gonna afford a home? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=124.48s)]
*  You know, it's so high. We have to get our fiscal house in order first, you know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=129.28s)]
*  Inflation is high interest rates are high and I've heard one of our big priorities is a deregulation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=133.88s)]
*  You know, there's too many regulations [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=140.08s)]
*  so the president has this theory that if you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=141.96s)]
*  Get the price of energy down then the price of all goods are gonna go go down as as well because you need the energy [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=145.36s)]
*  To be able to get the goods there [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=152.24s)]
*  So for the American people that are going to the grocery store going to the gas pump [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  When wish when should we expect to start to see the impact of the Trump drill baby drill? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=159.08s)]
*  It'll unfold over time Lawrence, but yes, some people wrongly view energy is like a sector of the economy [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=165.84s)]
*  It's not a sector. It's the sector of the economy that enables every other sector. He understands that energy is the key [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  It's the it's the key to American prosperity, but it's also the key to us [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  Solving these these wars abroad the core [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=183.56s)]
*  Underlying product that we need for every industry is going to be more intelligence manufactured here in the US with our sources [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=186.84s)]
*  So one of things that Chris and I are working on every day is how do we get more? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=194.26s)]
*  Electricity built in this country delivered in this country [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=198.22s)]
*  And then how do we get the price of that electricity down for our citizens? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  President Trump got elected on an agenda to unleash American energy. That's not just drill baby drill [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=204.64s)]
*  That's build baby build map and discover baby map and discover [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=210.42s)]
*  So there's a lot to be done, but a lot of low-hanging fruit [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=214.62s)]
*  Fantastic [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=219.82s)]
*  I'm just impressed with the amount of access. This administration has given us asked whatever question [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=220.94s)]
*  They're gonna answer they the way they want to answer [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=226.42s)]
*  But they give you the opportunity to at least ask the question that the American people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=228.98s)]
*  Want to know answers to very rare for four cabinet members just to come out on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=233.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly you talked a little bit earlier in the show that they said a prayer and we had video of that and that's Scott [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=241.22s)]
*  Turner you've been friends with him for a long time was a kid from Texas [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=248.06s)]
*  Right, and he is over HUD. He's HUD secretary and tell us more about that prayer [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=250.94s)]
*  I think we have a little here. Here's a little bit of it. Can you listen first and then tell us about it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=256.34s)]
*  Father for appointing us father God. Thank you for anointing us to do this job [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=264.14s)]
*  Father we pray you'll give the president the vice president wisdom father [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=269.62s)]
*  God as they lead father I pray for all of our colleagues that are here around the table and in this room [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=274.28s)]
*  My god, we pray that we would lead with a right ask him about that watch [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=279.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, mr [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=286.96s)]
*  Secretary did something that I don't think I've ever seen at a cabinet meeting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  He started the the meeting under the direction of the president with prayer [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=290.61999999999995s)]
*  This is a great privilege to be called upon to pray [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=294.28s)]
*  For the cabinet for our country and for the president and I take that very seriously [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=297.44s)]
*  You know being a man of faith and a pastor and a Christian to be able to pray before the cabinet meeting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  And honor the Lord and pray for my colleagues and the cabinet and the president that it was awesome [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  And I look forward to great days ahead to continue to pray for the American people but also to do great work [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  And the American people are praying for all those leaders. Yeah, because they're running the show. That's exactly right [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=318.84s)]
*  So he before he was a state rep in my home state of Texas [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=324.64s)]
*  He was served in the last head administration under Ben Carson [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  But he also was associate pastor at Preston would church in Plano, Texas and so [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=332.18s)]
*  the other secretary [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=338.66s)]
*  Act secretary of Brooke Rollins. It's also from Texas as well [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=341.14s)]
*  She said that they started the Bible study as well and I said I told her the moment she said that go [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=344.98s)]
*  I'm a telling you this I know she would want to hear about this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  And so they're doing that organically [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=353.54s)]
*  I think the whole country loves that because I'm putting God first and President Trump promised that when he ran [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=355.54s)]
*  He wants to bring God back into [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  Excellent job going down there. Thank you. Thank you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X-y6yAFIas&t=363.74s)]
