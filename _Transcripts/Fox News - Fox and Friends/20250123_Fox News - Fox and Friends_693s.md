# 'WARP SPEED': ICE makes hundreds of migrant arrests in sanctuary cities
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8)
*  So the Pentagon now deployed 1,500 troops to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=0.0s)]
*  And ICE moving at warp speed, arresting hundreds of illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=8.64s)]
*  Griff Jenkins is in Washington with more. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=13.92s)]
*  Hey, Griff. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=17.88s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=18.88s)]
*  And Ainsley, you mentioned promises made, promises kept. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=19.88s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=22.52s)]
*  Consequences are being delivered. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=23.52s)]
*  The crackdown has begun. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=25.44s)]
*  Trump could deploy actually as many as 10,000 active duty troops to the southern border. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=27.32s)]
*  And while they may not engage in law enforcement, they will be engaging in protecting our border, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=32.36s)]
*  including the use of military transport planes for deportation flights. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=37.4s)]
*  Now, a Marine official telling Fox News this, quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=41.6s)]
*  Now, the 1,500 soldiers and Marines deploying right now represent a 60% increase from the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=57.32s)]
*  already 2,500 that are there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=64.0s)]
*  And it comes as ICE's enforcement and removal officers have been hitting the streets across [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=66.8s)]
*  the country, launching early morning raids targeting some 700,000 criminal illegal aliens [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=71.34s)]
*  that have been roaming free under the Biden-Harris administration, protected in sanctuary cities [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=77.56s)]
*  like Boston. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=82.48s)]
*  In fact, ICE has racked up more than 460 arrests in the first 33 hours since Trump took office. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=83.64s)]
*  He sat down in the Oval Office last night with Hannity for his first interview and had this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=89.92s)]
*  to say. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  We talk Venezuela. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  That's a big abuser. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=96.84s)]
*  But these are countries from Iran, Syria, the countries that you don't even think of, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=97.84s)]
*  much more than South America. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=104.72s)]
*  Now, here's the important note. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=106.28s)]
*  Countries like Venezuela, where Chirundeh, Aragua comes from, or Iran that harbors terrorists, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=108.48s)]
*  they're recalcitrant countries, guys, meaning they don't currently take their citizens back. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=113.28s)]
*  But President Trump told me last month, point blank, in Mar-a-Lago, he said they'll take [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  them back or face economic consequences. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=122.32s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  So, Griff, it sounds like up to 10,000 troops are going to be eventually heading down within [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  the next period of days or weeks to our southern border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=131.88s)]
*  The Washington Post has got some juicy details, though. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  They say that border patrol agents are going to block migrants on the grounds that they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=137.96s)]
*  have passed through countries where communicable diseases are present. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=141.84s)]
*  They're going to say, you can't come in because you might have something. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=145.32s)]
*  And they're also, even though they're going to try to claim asylum, now under this new [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  executive order that they're apparently working on, only two people in the federal government [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=153.6s)]
*  will be able to allow them to be released into the country, two asylum seekers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=158.56s)]
*  One is Mike Ban- bike, sorry, Mike Banks, the new chief of border patrol, and his deputy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=163.8s)]
*  So only two people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=170.72s)]
*  That means the flow is going to just stop immediately. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=172.04s)]
*  It sure will. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=175.84s)]
*  And what you're talking about are, we have seen for the past four years, Steve, the notice [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=177.24s)]
*  to appear where they just release them, particularly when they don't have any place to put them [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=182.1s)]
*  because so many thousands were coming. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  But ultimately, it is the asylum, the remove in Mexico or migrant protection protocols [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=189.44s)]
*  that has been reinstated, meaning that you have to go back to the country where you just [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=194.92s)]
*  meaning in this case, Mexico, to wait for your asylum to play out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=199.96s)]
*  But under the Immigration and Nationality Act from 1965, there's a clause 212 F. You're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=203.72s)]
*  going to hear a lot about that in the coming days because that gives broad authority to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=209.72s)]
*  simply block and deny anyone from coming across to try and claim asylum on U.S. soil. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  And that is really the crux of what the Washington Post and what others are talking about. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=220.12s)]
*  And if you do indeed bolster and supplement your force with these active duty U.S. military [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=224.92s)]
*  troops, you can stop the gaps in places like California, Arizona and elsewhere where you [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  don't have the Texas DPS with miles of razor wire and extra forces. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  You're going to reinforce blocking entry. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  And so that is going to be something that we're going to see play out in the very near [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=245.32s)]
*  future. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=248.92s)]
*  What about the wall? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=249.92s)]
*  What's that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=250.92s)]
*  What about the wall? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=252.56s)]
*  Has the U.S. said anything about starting to build again? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=253.56s)]
*  Well you're already seeing the wall, the states like Texas saying we're ready to start moving [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=256.44s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=261.76s)]
*  And there was already an effort underway to get back some of those wall materials that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=262.76s)]
*  were being auctioned off. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=267.76s)]
*  I think we'll probably see the White House or President Trump in the very near future [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=270.08s)]
*  talk about exactly what pieces of wall and where they can put them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=274.36s)]
*  It's a very complex problem because it's not like you just build a wall and a line, but [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=279.9s)]
*  you can rest assured that Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks has got his people already looking [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=283.82s)]
*  at the most strategic areas to get wall up as fast as possible. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=289.02s)]
*  And Grip, real quick, you guys did you talk to, what if they say is the big difference [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=293.7s)]
*  this week than previous weeks? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=298.38s)]
*  Have they already seen a dramatic drop? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=300.06s)]
*  It's a great question and they say they have been taken off the leash and they are motivated [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=303.34s)]
*  like never before to try and go out and as one Border Patrol official told me yesterday, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=309.7s)]
*  consequences are being delivered and that's what they signed up to do and they're finally [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=315.62s)]
*  doing it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=320.2s)]
*  They are off the leash. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=321.2s)]
*  A new leash on life. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=322.2s)]
*  Traffic is slower than before. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=323.2s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=324.2s)]
*  Thank you very much, Grip. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=325.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=326.2s)]
*  So here's President Trump on what was going on prior to him getting into office. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=327.28s)]
*  I always say to people, you always like to understand, like in a business here, you want [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=333.64s)]
*  to understand the other side. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=337.08s)]
*  Why do they want something, et cetera, et cetera, and you figure it out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=338.08s)]
*  And there's usually an answer, almost always, I don't understand why does somebody want [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  open borders? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=345.78s)]
*  Why would anybody that likes our country, the Democrats, allow that to happen? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=346.86s)]
*  And even now, I watch them on television, they're trying to justify it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=352.02s)]
*  You can't justify it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=356.58s)]
*  The only reason it can be is two reasons. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=357.78s)]
*  You're stupid and I don't think they're stupid. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=360.78s)]
*  I think anybody that cheats that much and that well is not stupid. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=363.82s)]
*  You're either stupid or you hate the country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=368.52s)]
*  Those are the only two reasons. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=371.84s)]
*  Sanctuary states, by definition, or sanctuary cities, they're aiding and abetting and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  the law breaking. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=378.76s)]
*  Okay, they're going to get federal funds. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=379.76s)]
*  We're trying to get rid of them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=382.02s)]
*  We're trying to end them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=383.58s)]
*  A lot of the people in those communities don't want them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=384.58s)]
*  You know, California is a big example. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=386.94s)]
*  Would you cut off their money? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=388.26s)]
*  I might have to do that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=389.78s)]
*  Sometimes that's the only thing you can do. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=391.46s)]
*  So that's where the big fight is going to be. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=393.65999999999997s)]
*  I have no doubt. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=395.26s)]
*  The military is already on their way. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=396.26s)]
*  They're going to get the resources to secure the border. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=397.62s)]
*  So there's going to be a stop when it comes to people coming across. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=400.14s)]
*  You're going to have to apply for asylum in the first country that you touch or you [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=403.38s)]
*  can wait in Mexico because of Remain in Mexico. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  The app has been shut off. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=411.41999999999996s)]
*  So we're going to have a flow stop. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=412.46s)]
*  But you've got people that are still here, 10 million under the last administration. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=414.29999999999995s)]
*  And you've got some states and some cities that are going to harbor these people, not [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  going to want to cooperate. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=422.62s)]
*  And so I predict Donald Trump is going to go after them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=424.62s)]
*  And you've got a DOJ now that's on his side and wants to follow the law, but it's going [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=427.7s)]
*  to be litigated throughout the course. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  I talked to somebody at the DOJ last night. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=434.17999999999995s)]
*  And what they've done is they've taken some people who were in a different department [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  and now they've assigned them essentially to take a look at people in these sanctuary [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=440.94s)]
*  cities, officials. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=446.14s)]
*  And if they are hampering what the president is trying to do, figure a way to prosecute [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=447.62s)]
*  those local officials. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=454.54s)]
*  This is completely new. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=455.96s)]
*  Ashley Moody was the attorney general of the great state of Florida last week. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=457.5s)]
*  This week, she's a U.S. senator. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=462.54s)]
*  Here she is talking about how there is some resistance to some of these new policies. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=464.42s)]
*  Kudos to the Trump administration for coming out like lightning with these executive orders. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=471.38s)]
*  It's going to go very far in trying to round up so many of these serious criminals that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=476.92s)]
*  were released at the direction of the Biden administration. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=483.98s)]
*  Not only did it reinstate a program that allows locals and state officials to cooperate with [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=488.02s)]
*  the federal government, it sets up Homeland Security Task Forces, it encourages it, but [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=494.38s)]
*  it also says, hey, DOJ lawyers and agents, if people get in your way when these task [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=499.74s)]
*  forces identify and go after these folks and try and round them up, we're not standing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=506.22s)]
*  for it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=510.98s)]
*  That's a criminal violation, obstruction of a federal function or a federal investigation. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=511.98s)]
*  It's serious. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=516.78s)]
*  It's a felony. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=517.78s)]
*  You can bring criminal charges in some instances, but they've also set up litigators to go after [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=518.78s)]
*  folks, these governments and people civilly if they stand in the way, to bring actions [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=524.14s)]
*  to allow the feds to do their jobs. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=529.38s)]
*  It just reminded me of the wrestling match between them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=531.7s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump would say sanctuary city status is revoked, then they would sue [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=534.62s)]
*  back, would end up in the courts, and then the money would have to be restored if the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=538.46s)]
*  judge says it should be restored. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=543.02s)]
*  That's some of the battle. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=545.5s)]
*  My only hope is that some of these city council members are not hopelessly left and can start [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=546.5s)]
*  to read the room and understand the American people don't want illegal aliens, especially [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=553.98s)]
*  criminals here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=558.82s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump was asked about that last night by Sean, and he said, what will you [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=560.1s)]
*  do about the sanctuary cities when you get rid of them? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=564.4200000000001s)]
*  And he said, the only way to do that is really to cut off their money. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=566.9000000000001s)]
*  And also, we saw the images of the illegals being arrested. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=570.5400000000001s)]
*  Within a 33-hour span, they arrested 460 people. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  So that was from midnight on Monday until 9 a.m. yesterday. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=580.2600000000001s)]
*  There are probably more that were arrested throughout the day yesterday, but these are [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  illegals that have criminal history. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=587.3s)]
*  They are accused, some of them, of sexual assault, some domestic violence, drugs and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=590.5799999999999s)]
*  weapons crimes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=594.78s)]
*  And Tom Homan said one of them had actually raped a child. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=596.04s)]
*  So these are people that we don't want in our country. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=599.62s)]
*  And I was thinking, I wish that this had happened before Laken Reilly was killed. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=602.54s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=607.14s)]
*  There was a little girl down in Texas, Nungaree, and you went down to Jocelyn. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=608.14s)]
*  could mean that we spared 460 families from pain. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=612.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=617.1s)]
*  And with Lincoln, the Lincoln Reilly Act is going to be signed by the president of the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=618.1s)]
*  United States either today or tomorrow. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=623.3s)]
*  Under that, people who are in the country illegally, even though they've got a notice [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=625.88s)]
*  to appear or something like that, which they think is their get out of jail free card, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=630.02s)]
*  if they do something like, and some of the violations are low level, like shoplifting [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=634.04s)]
*  and stuff like that, if they get caught under this administration and this directive and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=639.3s)]
*  this bill, they can get sent home immediately. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=644.5s)]
*  There's one last component that they really have to get under control. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=647.58s)]
*  So you get those notices appeared. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=650.34s)]
*  And sometimes those court dates are three years out because they just don't have the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=651.66s)]
*  amount of judges. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=654.48s)]
*  You got to get immigration judges confirmed. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=655.74s)]
*  You need a slew of them to litigate these cases, present the evidence. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=658.18s)]
*  And if these people don't qualify for asylum, then they need a final deportation notice [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  to go back to wherever the country that they originated from. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=667.78s)]
*  But if you just have people just sitting in limbo, then that's going to slow down the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=669.86s)]
*  process. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=673.4599999999999s)]
*  You got to get the immigration judges to litigate. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=674.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, the first thing is there's no new ones. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=676.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=678.3s)]
*  No new cases starting yesterday. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=679.3s)]
*  So just about nobody's coming through. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQm7Haj63y8&t=680.6999999999999s)]
