# 'APOCALYPSE': Fire chief warns LA wildfire is 'worst case scenario'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c)
*  Let's bring in Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustin. Chief, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=0.0s)]
*  We keep seeing zero percent contained. We hear about low water pressure in Pacific Palisades. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=5.12s)]
*  Where does help coming where's help coming from and what would it look like? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=10.96s)]
*  Yeah, good morning and thanks for having me. I'm here at the iconic Rose Bowl where just a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=15.92s)]
*  week ago we were celebrating the parade and the Rose Bowl game and this really is a worst case [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  scenario. You know with as you mentioned 50, 60, 70 mile an hour wind gusts, a wind driven fire. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=26.16s)]
*  We've lost a significant amount of homes and I would estimate we're going to need tomorrow [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=33.92s)]
*  morning daytime but we're going to be in the 1500 to 2000 acres burned with zero percent containment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=39.92s)]
*  Yeah, Chief have you ever in your life seen anything like this? I mean the winds are coming [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  out up to 99 miles per hour and just pretty much everything in its path is going to burn [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=53.52s)]
*  because you can't stop it and you're running out of water and you don't have a lot of manpower. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=60.96s)]
*  I mean all hands on deck but you need more. We do and we we made a request for 50 strike teams [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=65.84s)]
*  from all over the state which would give us another 250 fire engines. When I was driving [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=72.64s)]
*  to the command post it really looked like an apocalypse. You couldn't see there was spot fires [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=77.68s)]
*  everywhere. There was trees coming down literally as we were driving and multiple multiple houses [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=83.68s)]
*  on fire. Definitely the worst brush fire and worst incident that Pasadena has seen in its history. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=90.64000000000001s)]
*  Chief can you explain the water pressure issue that you guys we continue to hear about? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  We do and thankfully Pasadena tonight we we have not had significant water pressure issues. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=103.36s)]
*  The crews have been able to get water out of hydrants. The problem is is that this is a wind [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  driven fire and it's we're having spotting multiple miles ahead of a fire and it is we could have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=115.28s)]
*  another 500 firefighters here on this incident and we still wouldn't be able to stop this fire. We [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=122.56s)]
*  really need the winds to die down. We need to get aircraft in the air and be able to start doing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  water drops and then come behind it with fire crews. So chief you can't even start containment [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=134.8s)]
*  until that happens? No and our crews are doing there was some really heroic activities of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=140.24s)]
*  between police and fire tonight with you know multiple residents being saved people being [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=147.28s)]
*  pulled out of burning buildings and things that you you know you hear but it was happening in real [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=153.28s)]
*  time but the fire is spreading so rapidly by the time our crews pull hose lines and start it trying [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=159.36s)]
*  to extinguish a fire it's it's three houses down instead of just the house that they were [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=166.24s)]
*  trying to fight. Yeah and chief I know that you guys were telling people they should evacuate [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=172.72s)]
*  because we knew yesterday the winds were going to be really high at that point it was going to be [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=177.68s)]
*  70 or 80 miles an hour now almost 100 but I know when people have to evacuate out in that area [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=181.76s)]
*  everybody has a go bag and you got supplies you got your prescriptions and stuff like that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=187.84s)]
*  but what's really important is you need a map and you need two evacuation routes and this is the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=192.56s)]
*  reason why because people think okay I'm going to go inland well this time you can't go that way [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=198.64s)]
*  or you can't go north you can't go south you don't know where to go. Right and to your point [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=204.0s)]
*  Pasadena has a lot of one way in one way out just like Malibu we're getting another really big wind [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=210.32s)]
*  gust here and so we really preach having that go bag being self-sufficient for 72 hours have a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=216.56s)]
*  primary and a secondary evacuation route a meeting place for your family because we've been preparing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=223.2s)]
*  for this this event for the past few days as a wind event not not necessarily as a fire event [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=230.4s)]
*  and here we are with just devastating fires on top of the wind event we've had multiple [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=237.52s)]
*  evacuations we're just in the process of expanding our mandatory evacuation zones because we're [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  having a wind shift and with those ember casting of up to two to three miles it really expands the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=250.08s)]
*  the area of Pasadena where we need to evacuate residents. All right chief stay safe thanks so [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=256.48s)]
*  much thank you we'll talk to you again hopefully you get those 50 strike teams quickly. More [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm4sClNS_7c&t=261.12s)]
