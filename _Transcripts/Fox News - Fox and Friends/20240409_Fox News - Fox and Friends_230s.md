# AOC defends 'uncommitted' voters pushing for Gaza cease-fire
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA)
*  Here's AOC. She was on TV last night on late night where she was talking about how those uncommitted votes actually have a purpose. Watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=0.0s)]
*  The upside of the uncommitted movement, which is that these are folks that could have easily given way to cynicism and walked away from this process entirely. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=11.44s)]
*  And what they're doing instead is using the primary to send a message and say, this is important to me, to the president. This is important to me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=22.44s)]
*  I'm going to engage in our democratic process. I am going to show up. I am going to vote. I am going to say what's important to me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=33.2s)]
*  But I also know, and I do believe that many in the uncommitted campaign believe this, I also know and understand the threat of a Donald Trump presidency. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=40.72s)]
*  Yeah, but they want to destroy the country in the process. They hate the country in the process. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=50.44s)]
*  Why are they in this country? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=54.12s)]
*  Why are they in the country? And why does the president want their vote? Why do you want those people that chant death to America to vote for you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=55.48s)]
*  I don't understand. Why is there no answer from the president and the White House press secretary about the people that are in the middle of the street calling for the destruction of the country and Israel? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=62.32s)]
*  Wipe them out. They've made it very clear. This is not semantics or we have to assume what they think. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  We now have video of what they've been saying all summer long. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=77.28s)]
*  To do the right thing can be costly. And to your point, it could cost him votes if he doesn't support this, if he just stands with Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=80.64s)]
*  But that is what the majority of the country wants him to do. This is not Israel's fault. What happened on October 7th? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=87.0s)]
*  There was a ceasefire the day before. Then you have Hamas that comes in and steals these hostages, human beings, babies, women, not to mention the ones that they killed, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  put them in ovens and cut off limbs and all kinds of things that are so horrific. Then they took these hostages. There are 133 that are still being held captive. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=103.2s)]
*  It's been six months now. What do you expect Israel to do? They have to fight back. I would think we would fight back if this happened to us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=112.0s)]
*  Well, we need a president that stands with them. That is there. They're our ally. We are their best ally. Absolutely. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=119.08s)]
*  Used to be. So right now we have our CIA guy, CIA Director Burns over there, and they're proposing, he brought up a proposal, 900 Palestinian prisoners for 40 Israeli hostages. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=124.84s)]
*  At least 100 have life sentences with blood on their hands. So let out murderers to get 40 hostages who were guilty of being in their house when the Palestinian, when Hamas came and captured them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=139.32s)]
*  And AOC, you want to ceasefire? Then demand that those hostages are released. This will all be. And Hamas surrender. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=153.72s)]
*  But ultimately, the Democrats feel that all those people who voted uncommitted or left to blank or whatever come November will still come back to Joe Biden because, as she said at the end, he's better than Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=160.0s)]
*  We don't even have an accurate number of the hostages right now. We don't know who's alive, who's dead. Max 133 alive. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=171.24s)]
*  133. The 134th was found. The body was found. It turns out that person was killed. So it looks like 133. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=178.48s)]
*  But then Bill, who is going to go into rough anyway, says I'm setting a date. I'm doing it as he should. But I hope so. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=185.84s)]
*  I think I read over the weekend Hamas says there are 40 or so hostages. We have no idea where they are and we have no control over them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because they sold them off to all these other little terror cells for negotiation purposes as well, because all of these other ones were involved in October the 7th. So they needed something. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=200.48s)]
*  Iran probably has some. The Houthis have some. They got more than they thought. And the Islamic Jihad grabbed some too. And now they really don't have track of them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJqOd3ynLEA&t=211.23999999999998s)]
