# This system is ‘non-existent,’ Florida sheriff warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk)
*  after taking down a ring of Colombian gangsters for breaking into houses in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=0.0s)]
*  Florida and stealing over $1.7 million worth of jewelry and clothes, all kinds of things. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  A sheriff has had enough with the immigration system under the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Joining us right now is Polk County Sheriff, Grady Judd. Sheriff, how bad is this problem [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  compared to past years? Well, when you think about the Colombians coming here with organized [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=25.84s)]
*  groups through the Mexican border and stealing millions of dollars, these are high-end burglars. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=33.12s)]
*  They have jamming equipment. They have ways to bypass security alarms. They focused in this event [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=40.88s)]
*  seven of our nine cases where we made arrests on Asian Americans that came to this country the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=48.8s)]
*  right way. They had small businesses that were very successful. They patterned them. They followed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=54.8s)]
*  them from work to home. They determined who the owners were, and then they attacked their homes [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=60.64s)]
*  while they were sure that they were at work and stole $1.7 million from nine different [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=68.08s)]
*  business owners. Now, think about that. You live in a gated community. Two of these four guys are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=76.4s)]
*  at large. They may be in a gated community near you right now. Sheriff, we're not going to hear [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=81.52s)]
*  about this at the convention, are we? You said that our immigration system is non-existent in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=88.08s)]
*  that press conference. We're not going to hear the names of the women who have been raped by illegals [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=93.36s)]
*  or the people who have been murdered by illegals. We won't hear about the fact that we know there [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=98.64s)]
*  are people with terror ties that have come across our border that are here illegally. We're not going [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=104.16s)]
*  to hear about the illegal criminals that Kamala Harris lets back out on the street after they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=109.2s)]
*  commit crimes, are we? No, Ainsley. With these four groups here, the policies in New York, NYPD [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=113.92s)]
*  actually arrested these folks. One of them already had an outstanding pickup by the federal government [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  for a cut monitor, but yet they didn't report it to ICE. Then ICE deported another one of these folks [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=128.96s)]
*  when we tell them, hey, we're getting ready to file racketeering charges. You cannot believe if [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=135.92s)]
*  the American people saw from the inside out what we see every day, you would find out this catch and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  release, notices to appear, they don't show up, then they show up in your home in your gated community [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=148.88s)]
*  committing burglaries. It's a non-existent policy. But you know what? If you keep electing the same [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=156.56s)]
*  people at the state and federal level that you always have, you'll get what you've always gotten. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=162.88s)]
*  It doesn't seem to bother anybody until their child dies of a fentanyl overdose or their house [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=169.12s)]
*  is broken into and all of their high-end jury is stolen. But the reality is this is alive and well, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=175.6s)]
*  and it's a porous border allowing every bit of this. So, Sheriff, some people call you America, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=183.2s)]
*  I think I'll join them in saying that as well. Chicago's expecting a large population of illegal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  migrants to come to the city. They also got to deal with the pro-Hamas people, and they say they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=196.64s)]
*  already down cops in the city of Chicago. They got a violent crime problem. Plus, they're saying that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=201.28s)]
*  they're going to depend on some of the locals that are coming out of state. So how does an out-of-state [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  cop, police in an area like this, is out of control? Well, it's very difficult. They put out [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=213.68s)]
*  requests for law enforcement officers, but I certainly wouldn't send any of mine to any of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=220.88s)]
*  those big blue states because I may send them up there to help, and they end up criminally charged. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=226.32s)]
*  You know, in Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland, they seem to think more of the criminals that are coming [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  here illegally across the border to commit crime than they do the law-abiding citizens and the cops [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=239.92s)]
*  that are trying to protect them. Yeah, we know that seems to be the theme, especially with this [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  mayor in Chicago. Sheriff Crady, Judd, thanks so much. Thank you, Sheriff. Thanks, Sheriff. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=249.92s)]
*  Take care, my friends. See y'all soon. And he's why Florida's safe. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhmtpraouk&t=255.27999999999997s)]
