**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg)
*  All right, former President Donald Trump telling a pack crowd on Long Island that he will win [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=0.0s)]
*  Deep Blue New York. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=10.18s)]
*  With terrorists and criminals pouring in and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=12.96s)]
*  for Donald Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=20.0s)]
*  What the hell do you have to lose? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=21.84s)]
*  One New Yorker agrees, the guy is screaming right there, and is throwing his support behind [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=25.64s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Restaurant owner and the father of pop icon Lady Gaga, Joe Germana joins us right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=32.24s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=39.0s)]
*  Hey Joe, good morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=40.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=41.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=42.0s)]
*  Well, look, they're two vastly different people, okay? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=43.0s)]
*  One of them is pure, you know, and he's a patriot, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=47.96s)]
*  And the other, you know, just going to say whatever she needs to say to get elected. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=53.24s)]
*  All right, that's basically what I hear, right? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=57.04s)]
*  And I'm tired of hearing about her neighbor's lawn, to be honest with you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=62.84s)]
*  I heard that too many times. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=63.84s)]
*  They have a lot of tough children. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=64.84s)]
*  At your core, you're a businessman. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=65.84s)]
*  I'm a businessman. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=66.84s)]
*  And so, compare under the Trump administration for your business versus this current administration. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=67.84s)]
*  I was going to have the best year we ever had at Joanne before COVID. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=78.12s)]
*  And when I say best year, it was 25% more than any other year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=87.2s)]
*  But I mean, the real foundation, I'm not voting for people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=88.2s)]
*  I mean, look, Donald, yeah, he's abrasive, okay? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=91.64s)]
*  But you know, he's a patriot and his policies are there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  All right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=99.0s)]
*  They're on target for me anyway. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=100.0s)]
*  All right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=101.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm into low fuel and food prices, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=102.44s)]
*  Low interest rates. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=108.0s)]

*  A good economy, pro police. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=112.08s)]
*  I mean, let the police do their job. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=113.08s)]
*  Law and order, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=115.36s)]
*  Don't let these protesters burn down our cities and the small businesses, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=117.04s)]
*  Keep the jobs here in the United States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=121.76s)]
*  I mean, they're all, I mean, if you stack them up side by side, I don't know what the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=124.64s)]
*  hell she's talking about. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=129.0s)]

*  Opportunity. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  The world is an opportunity zone, okay? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRO_q860Jtg&t=135.04000000000002s)]
