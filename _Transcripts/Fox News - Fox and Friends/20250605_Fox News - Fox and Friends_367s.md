# 'LONG OVERDUE': Trump praised for travel ban affecting 12 countries
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc)
*  So President Trump banning travel from 12 countries and placing restrictions on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=0.0s)]
*  seven others in the wake of national security concerns related to the Boulder [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  terror attack. The strength of the restrictions we're applying depends on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=8.48s)]
*  the severity of the threat posed. The list is subject to revision based on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=14.72s)]
*  whether material improvements are made and likewise new countries can be added [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=20.36s)]
*  as threats emerge around the world. And in a separate proclamation he moved to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=25.6s)]
*  officially block new foreign students from getting visas to attend Harvard [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=30.160000000000004s)]
*  University urging his administration to consider revoking current visas as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=33.92s)]
*  And keep in mind there's over a hundred thousand Chinese students here. Here to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  discuss is Arkansas Senator and Harvard grad Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=42.08s)]
*  Senator first off on the ban of those nations how do you feel about it? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=46.72s)]
*  I commend the president for implementing this badly needed and overdue ban on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=51.04s)]
*  countries where we really can't vet anyone. Countries have a history of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=58.08s)]
*  known violence and terrorism. Take for instance Haiti and Somalia. You have gang [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=62.08s)]
*  violence that is basically controlling all of Haiti. You have Islamic terrorism [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=68.8s)]
*  across Somalia. And what does it even mean to vet someone from those countries? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=72.64s)]
*  There's no governing institutions there that can do background checks. This has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=77.16s)]
*  long been a lie from the left wing about how we're going to do background checks [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=81.24s)]
*  on illegal immigrants or people coming from dangerous countries. It's simply not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=86.68s)]
*  possible. I mean consider what we do for young Americans who want to go in the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=90.28s)]
*  military or the law enforcement. You know they have to say where they've lived. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  You call up the police department. You call the state police. You do background [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=97.88s)]
*  checks. You make sure they're suited for the job. There are no institutions in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=101.32s)]
*  many of these countries where you can do these things. So this is another [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=105.04s)]
*  common sense victory for President Trump and America's safety. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=107.76s)]
*  Senator Congressman Dan Goldman says it's because they're not white. That's why [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  that's why Trump is looking to ban and limit them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=115.68s)]
*  No it's because they're dangerous and they could get us killed. We saw over the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=119.92s)]
*  weekend in Boulder Colorado the danger of having foreign nationals coming to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  this country without being properly vetted. In many countries they can't be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=128.16s)]
*  properly vetted. We shouldn't allow people in from those countries if [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=131.44s)]
*  they're going to pose a risk to Americans. So in your book Seven Things [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=135.12s)]
*  You Can't Say About China you really alerted the country to what the danger is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=138.56s)]
*  Now we find out specifically we have these two Chinese Michigan students [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=142.0s)]
*  are with CCP ties accused of smuggling a dangerous agro-terrorism fungus into the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=146.48s)]
*  U.S. Their explanations are ridiculous. Do you really think that these are two [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=153.28s)]
*  renegade students looking to create havoc or do you think they're curious [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=158.24s)]
*  scientists? Do you think this is CCP inspired? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=163.28s)]
*  Yeah Brian just like the curious scientists at the Wuhan labs that wanted [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=169.28s)]
*  to research bat-based coronaviruses. Look we don't know the full story yet but [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=172.8s)]
*  it's clear from what the FBI and the Department of Justice released is that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  they're up to no good and I think it's a pretty safe default position that any [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=181.28s)]
*  Chinese national who gets an exit visa from China to come to one of America's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=186.24s)]
*  universities is probably linked to the Chinese Communist Party or the People's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=190.96s)]
*  Liberation Army. That's one reason why President Trump has said we're going to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=195.12s)]
*  start severely restricting visas from hostile nations like China. We don't want [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=198.8s)]
*  a lot of Chinese spies running around America's premier research institutes and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  that's why I'm introducing legislation that would prevent funding for these [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  institutions if they are hosting nationals from adversarial foreign countries like China. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=212.56s)]
*  I just don't understand we're allowing 150,000 plus Chinese students to come here. Some major [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=219.04s)]
*  potential threats from China. Mysterious seeds as you just saw. Spycraft. You got [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=224.48s)]
*  surveillance craft across in the U.S. You know about the balloons. You also know they've [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=229.12s)]
*  infiltrated all in the White House communications. That's why they're using [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=233.04s)]
*  the signal app. The land purchases of Chinese companies by military installations, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=238.0s)]
*  cranes in U.S. ports and TikTok by the way as evil as it gets. We have to do with the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=242.64s)]
*  Senate and House want you to do and ban it. But when it comes to land purchases, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=248.16s)]
*  this governor in Arizona pushed back on that and vetoed it. How does that make any sense? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=253.12s)]
*  Well it doesn't make sense to me Brian. You know in Arkansas we restricted the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=261.12s)]
*  purchase of land by Chinese nationals. Again, there's a pretty safe default assumption until [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=264.32s)]
*  proven wrong that Chinese nationals are coming into the United States and buying up land, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=269.28s)]
*  especially sensitive land like land near Air Force bases or other critical infrastructure or [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=273.84s)]
*  vast swaths of our farmland are probably linked to the Chinese Communist Party or the People's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=279.76s)]
*  Liberation Army. So I think it's a common sense step that the Arizona legislature tried to take. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=285.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Democratic governor and a partisan action vetoed that legislation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=290.56s)]
*  Real quick, do you want to see the president take the sanctions bill up and put that those [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=296.16s)]
*  sanctions on Russia? Got over 80 votes in the Senate for it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=300.32s)]
*  Well as he posted yesterday on social media, it would clearly give him more leverage with [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=306.72s)]
*  Vladimir Putin who has shown no indication that he wants a peace deal, that he even wants a ceasefire. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=310.56s)]
*  It's pretty simple. When Ukraine attacks Russia, they're attacking Russia's military bases. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=316.96s)]
*  When Russia attacks Ukraine, they're attacking residential neighborhoods and children's hospitals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=321.44s)]
*  We can all hope that we get peace, but it's clear that Vladimir Putin once again is involved [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  in unprovoked aggression and depraved violence against innocent civilians. I think the sanctions [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  legislation would give the president an even stronger hand. I do too. I think the Ukrainians [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=338.24s)]
*  improved brilliant and resourceful. I cannot believe what they were able to pull off. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=343.28s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton, thanks so much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVEQZF5O_yc&t=347.2s)]
