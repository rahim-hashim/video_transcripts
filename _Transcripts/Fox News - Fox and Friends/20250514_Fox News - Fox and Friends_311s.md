# 'SHAKEN': Biden didn't recognize this A-list star and longtime friend at 2024 event, book claims
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc)
*  Another new book about former President Joe Biden says the former president didn't recognize his longtime friend and movie star George Clooney at the June 2024 fundraiser. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=0.0s)]
*  It also says aides discussed him using a wheelchair if he were re-elected. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=10.0s)]
*  Quote, Biden's physical deterioration, most apparent in his halting walk, had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=15.0s)]
*  So let's bring in Fox News contributor Guy Benson. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=27.0s)]
*  Hey Guy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=29.0s)]
*  Hey Ainsley. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=32.0s)]
*  Good morning. Doesn't this reveal the White House's determination to lie, to conceal, to cover this up? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=33.0s)]
*  Well sure, I mean that's not a huge surprise. We've known this for a long time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=40.0s)]
*  What's getting me and really frustrating me, Ainsley, in a lot of the coverage, not here but many other places, is this whole new level of gaslighting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=44.0s)]
*  Right? The old lies have expired, so we're on to new lies where virtually everyone in the media and everyone in the Democratic Party gets to turn around and say, my goodness, heavens to Betsy, clutching their pearls. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=54.0s)]
*  We were duped. We were lied to by this small group of people with special access and they told us he was fine and that wasn't true and shame on them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=66.0s)]
*  And therefore they cleanse themselves of responsibility and absolve themselves for everything that they did in support of the lie that was clearly a lie at the time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=75.0s)]
*  Like you didn't need access to the Oval Office to understand there was a problem. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=84.0s)]
*  You needed access to a television screen or a phone with the Internet to watch videos of the president doing things like speaking and walking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=89.0s)]
*  Right? This was not a carefully guarded secret. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=98.0s)]
*  It was in the open. Many of us used our powers of observation to call it out at the time. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=102.0s)]
*  We were called the crazy ones and the liars and the merchants of misinformation, the cheap fakers and all of that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=107.0s)]
*  And now we have, after the fact, these books coming out and people using those as excuses or even like venues for them to say, oh, yes, actually, we don't bear responsibility. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=112.0s)]
*  That's like four people over at the White House and they're all dispensable now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=124.0s)]
*  Shame on them, not on us. Let's move on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=128.0s)]
*  They should not get away with that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=130.0s)]
*  And then to not even recognize his friend for 20 years who threw the fundraiser for him, George Clooney, an aide says in the book, quote, you know, George, George Clooney. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=132.0s)]
*  And then he had to be reminded. Oh, oh, yes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=141.0s)]
*  All right, let's move on to this next topic. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=144.0s)]
*  The House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffers, is responding to what David Hogg, David Hogg is the vice chair of the DNC. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=146.0s)]
*  They are trying to oust him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=154.0s)]
*  And it turns out the DNC will vote later this year on whether to remove him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=156.0s)]
*  And then the House Minority Leader was was defending the Democrats. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=160.0s)]
*  So let me read a quote from what David Hogg said first. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=164.0s)]
*  He said, Today, the DNC took its first steps to remove me from my position as vice chair at large. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=167.0s)]
*  While this vote was based on how the DNC conducted its officers elections, which I had nothing to do with, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=172.0s)]
*  it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=178.0s)]
*  Our country's in crisis and too many leaders in the Democratic Party are asleep at the wheel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=184.0s)]
*  Then here's Hakeem Jeffers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=188.0s)]
*  I think what I'm doing that's different from before is I'm challenging the status quo in a direct way and head on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=191.0s)]
*  And that really scares people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=196.0s)]
*  But frankly, I think right now nobody should be comfortable when our country is in a moment of crisis. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=198.0s)]
*  And I think that there is far too much comfortability across the board. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=202.0s)]
*  And we need to make sure that we are electing the best people possible and in our own party. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=206.0s)]
*  The vice chair of the DNC, David Hogg, he said today, quote, too many leaders in the Democratic Party are asleep at the wheel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=211.0s)]
*  You're obviously a leader in the Democratic Party. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=217.0s)]
*  Did he mention me by name? He did not. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=220.0s)]
*  But you are a leader. OK. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=222.0s)]
*  Democrats sleep at the wheel. Does he have a point? And should he stay in his role? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=224.0s)]
*  I think I've been very clear about my perspective on David Hogg. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=227.0s)]
*  And I'm going to defend every single member of the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=230.0s)]
*  House of Representatives and Democratic caucus. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=234.0s)]
*  Guy, your response. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=237.0s)]
*  I mean, as a punt from Jeffries, I do have to say as a non-fan of David Hogg, which is probably not a shock to many people, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=241.0s)]
*  it is a bit delicious that he might lose his post because of a DEI provision within the Democratic Party. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=247.0s)]
*  And he's not diverse enough. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=254.0s)]
*  And they didn't do their procedures properly under that rubric. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=256.0s)]
*  So they might have to do a reelection. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=259.0s)]
*  I understand why he's upset about that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=262.0s)]
*  It does seem like the knives are out for him for other reasons. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=264.0s)]
*  But I'm just sitting here wondering, Ainsley, are the Democrats about to cancel another one of their elections? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=267.0s)]
*  They did one last year, right? The presidential primary. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=273.0s)]
*  They threw millions of votes in the garbage because the lie we were just talking about about the incumbent all fell apart on the debate stage. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=276.0s)]
*  All right, never mind. The primary is gone. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=283.0s)]
*  Are they now going to undo and void and nullify their leadership election of the DNC as well? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=285.0s)]
*  I mean, this is wild to see from the party of democracy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah, they don't let the people talk. They just decide who's going to be in positions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=295.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Guy. Great to see you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5E_-eTvTFc&t=298.0s)]
