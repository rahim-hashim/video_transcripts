# Ukraine's Zelenskyy to sign mineral deal during Trump White House visit
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I)
*  Well, this is news. Ukrainian President Zelensky is expected to meet with our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=0.0s)]
*  President, President Donald Trump on Friday after he reportedly has [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=6.72s)]
*  agreed to terms of a major mineral deal with the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=11.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, I have the chance to sit down for an exclusive sit down with Secretary of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=15.44s)]
*  State Marco Rubio. Yes, we did walk and here's what he told me about all this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=19.32s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, first off, congratulations. 99 votes. I guess everyone is behind you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=24.0s)]
*  How does it feel 30 plus days in? Busy. We've been busy. You know, we're doing a lot of work. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=31.16s)]
*  We're doing the work of diplomacy in the State Department. A lot of, you know, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=36.36s)]
*  this President Trump is not a patient man. He works, moves very quickly. He's been given a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=39.04s)]
*  mandate and he hit the ground running from day one. One thing he said he wanted to do is address [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=43.36s)]
*  the Ukraine-Russia war quickly. It looks like the mineral deal has been done. Can you confirm that? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=47.96s)]
*  Well, I can't confirm it. Obviously, our Secretary of Treasury, Besant, is working on that. He's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=52.64s)]
*  done a great job of putting that together. So my last indication was that it was very close to the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=57.96s)]
*  finish line. We were on the, not even the one-yard line, we were like at the half-yard line, you know, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=62.96s)]
*  like almost like when the Eagles pushed the quarterback across, you know, that tush push thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=66.56s)]
*  So it's close and it's good. Look, it's a good deal. It's an important deal. We still want to end [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=70.16s)]
*  this war. I mean, that's the important thing the President's made very clear. He campaigned on that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=74.44s)]
*  President Zelensky and the President clashed last week. There's no doubt about it. This week [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=77.92s)]
*  is going to be different. It looks like that President Zelensky is going to be here in Washington [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=81.84s)]
*  this week. How much friction is between President Zelensky and President Trump? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  I don't, you know, people, there's a lot of stuff in the media about it, but in the end of the day, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  the President's objective is clear. He wants the war to stop. And to do that, you have to have both [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=93.24s)]
*  sides agree to it, right? Now, we talked to Zelensky. I think what the President was irritated by, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  and rightfully so, was this argument that somehow we haven't talked to Ukraine. After President [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=101.28s)]
*  Trump spoke to Putin, she hadn't spoken to him in four years, he picked up the phone. I was there [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=106.36s)]
*  for both calls. He immediately called Zelensky right away. And then Zelensky met with our Treasury [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=111.92s)]
*  Secretary, and then he met with me and the Vice President, and then he met with Kellogg. And then, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=116.12s)]
*  so he has had engagements, constant engagements. I've talked to the Foreign Minister of Ukraine [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=120.28s)]
*  twice in the last six days. So to say that we're not engaged with him is just not accurate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=124.32s)]
*  What makes you believe that the Russians is sincerely want to have this war to end? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=128.76s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=133.04s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=134.44s)]
*  I think we're going to test it. We told them, do you guys want to end the war, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=135.36s)]
*  do you want to continue? If you want to end the war, we can talk about what it would take to end [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=138.36s)]
*  it from their perspective. If you want to continue on the war, just tell us now. And they agreed to a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  follow-up where we're going to send teams of diplomats to meet with theirs to sort of talk [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  about what it would take to end the war. If what they insist on is unrealistic, then we know they're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=151.28s)]
*  not real about it. But we have to test that proposition. We need to know, and the President [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  wants to know early in his presidency, are the Russians interested in ending this war, or are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  they not? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=163.8s)]
*  Germany had a big election. President Trump congratulated the new presumed leader, although [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=164.08s)]
*  it's going to take months for them to form a government. Its name is Frederick Mertz. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  And he said this, I would never have thought I would be saying this on TV. But after Donald [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  Trump's remark last week, it is clear that the government does not care much about the fate of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Europe. My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that step by [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  step we can really achieve independence from the U.S. He says, NATO in its current form is in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=187.36s)]
*  jeopardy. It's time for the European nations may have to establish an independent European defense [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=192.12s)]
*  capability. Your reaction? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=196.84s)]
*  My reaction is NATO is not in jeopardy. The only thing that puts NATO in jeopardy is the fact that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  we have NATO allies who barely have militaries or whose militaries are not very capable because [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=202.8s)]
*  they've spent 40 years not spending any money on it. We've been NATO. And all President Trump has [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=207.24s)]
*  argued is what every president, every American president has argued for the last 30 years. And [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=212.16s)]
*  that is these are rich countries, especially in Western Europe. They have plenty of money. They [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  should be investing that in the national security and they're not. You have countries spending one [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=221.08s)]
*  and a half percent, one percent of their economy, and we just can't keep subsidizing that. It's not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=224.56s)]
*  fair and it's not sustainable. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  He thinks that the U.S. wants out of Europe, do your own thing. Is he misreading Donald Trump? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=230.44s)]
*  No, we're not saying do your own thing. We're saying do more. It's their continent, right? Why [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  should we not be? Why is it unreasonable for the United States to ask rich European countries to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  invest more money in their own national security? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=246.56s)]
*  What a start you've had. 30 plus days you've been to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=248.84s)]
*  Dominican Republic, Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia and UAE. In the beginning, you got six nations [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=254.0s)]
*  there, Central and South America. There's a message and it seems to have been our border matters. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=259.88s)]
*  Let's establish some relationship because we got to get control of our southern border and you got to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=265.2s)]
*  control yours. What did you walk away with? What was your message? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=270.0s)]
*  Well, we walked away from the following. All those countries you mentioned in Central America are all [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=272.92s)]
*  migratory routes. That is the route that people take to get to the southern border. So our border, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=277.04s)]
*  in many cases, when it comes to mass migration, begins there. So we want countries to cooperate in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=282.0s)]
*  stopping it. In addition, a number of these countries, I add Honduras now to the list, a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  number of these countries have now agreed not just to take back repatriation flights of their own [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=290.72s)]
*  nationals, but to take third country. Meaning people from other countries who basically enter [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=295.36s)]
*  the United States illegally, we can send them to those countries and they have a choice. They can [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=300.16s)]
*  go back to their home country or they can go to these countries. These are powerful tools and that's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=303.92s)]
*  why you're now seeing historically low numbers under President Trump. Do you think it has a lot to do with [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  President Trump? It has to do with the fact that people that were coming here realize that this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=315.92s)]
*  isn't Joe Biden. Under President Trump, you're not just going to be able to come in, claim asylum, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=320.24s)]
*  and stay forever. And so we are literally, in some of these countries, I had a call yesterday, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=324.32s)]
*  one of these countries, they now have people doing U-turns, right? They were on their way here, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  they realized, okay, they're not playing around anymore. President Trump is serious, and they've [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=332.24s)]
*  done a U-turn. They're trying to go back to their country. We're seeing that happen, and that is as [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=336.72s)]
*  a result of President Trump's very clear leadership on migration. Have we allowed, over decades, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  China to make their way into Central and South America? And is Panama an example of that? Yes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=346.16s)]
*  We've just not put enough attention in our own backyard. Is that what you heard when you went [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=350.56s)]
*  there? It is. I mean, a couple things. They're corruption, right? The previous president, two [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=355.36s)]
*  presidents ago, those people are all wrapped up in a web of corruption. In fact, he's standing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=359.44s)]
*  trial in Panama now for that. So they bought their way like they've done in many parts. And [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=364.32s)]
*  you wake up one day and realize they control both of the ports of entry to the Panama Canal. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=368.16s)]
*  They control the cranes. They have a huge presence there. And I'm very happy that after our visit, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=372.72s)]
*  I think the same day I was there, Panama became the first country in Latin America, in the Western [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=377.76s)]
*  Hemisphere, to get out of the Belt and Road Initiative. And I think there'll be more news [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=382.72s)]
*  coming up soon with regards to Panama, all positive for America. You've called China the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=386.64s)]
*  most dangerous near-peer adversary the U.S. has faced. Ever. So we need concrete steps to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=390.56s)]
*  face off with them, who clearly are building up their military to face off with us. Yes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=397.28s)]
*  As sophisticated as possible. What is your plan? And they have told us by 2027 they're taking Taiwan. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=401.44s)]
*  Well, there's... Daily incursions. What could you do about it? How committed are you and the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=407.84s)]
*  president of the United States to defending Taiwan? There's three things we have to do when it [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=411.52s)]
*  comes to... Look, China's going to be a rich and powerful country. No matter what we do, that's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=415.28s)]
*  what we're going to have to deal with that. But we have to deal with the reality. What we cannot [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=418.88s)]
*  have is a world where China is so powerful, we depend on them. And that's right now where we're [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=421.84s)]
*  headed, unfortunately. That's going to change. It's going to change under President Trump. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=425.84s)]
*  Number one is we have to have our own domestic capability. If you don't want to depend on China, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  you better be able to make it for yourself. And we've allowed way too many industries to fall into [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=433.52s)]
*  the hands of the Chinese. Everything from rare earth minerals to pharmaceuticals, we have to have [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=437.84s)]
*  a domestic capacity. And it's one of the ideas behind the tariffs that the president is pursuing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=442.4s)]
*  large. So people say, we'll only put tariffs on China. Well, that's not enough because China [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  has factories in other countries all over the world and they flood us with those products. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=451.2s)]
*  That's... So we have to have our own domestic capacity. Number two is we have to have... We [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=454.88s)]
*  have to be present. In the Indo-Pacific, they're trying to drive us out. We have a strong [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=458.88s)]
*  relationship. We are a Pacific nation. We are. And so we have relationships in the Pacific and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=462.64s)]
*  we're not going to abandon those. Japan, South Korea. You mentioned Taiwan. We have a long [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=466.96s)]
*  standing position on Taiwan that we're not going to abandon. And that is we are against any forced, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=471.84s)]
*  compelled, coercive change in the status of Taiwan. That's been our position since the late 1970s, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  and that continues to be our position. And that's not going to change. And then the third is, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=484.0s)]
*  and it's outside the purview of this department at state, but we have to have military capabilities [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  that allow us to respond to the threat that China's posing. And we need to be concerned. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=492.55999999999995s)]
*  We have our aircraft manufacturing, our ship manufacturers. They are not keeping pace. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=496.64s)]
*  China can build 10 ships before we can build one. That's a very serious vulnerability that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=501.44s)]
*  cannot continue. And obviously I know Pete has a plan for that and the president has a plan for that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=506.32s)]
*  and they're working on it. You know, excellent interview, Brian. Marco Rubio was born for that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=510.56s)]
*  job. He's fantastic. Yeah, he was. Brian, you covered Russia, Ukraine, countries not spending [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=517.12s)]
*  enough on their own national security and relying on us. You talked about the border, the Panama [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=523.2s)]
*  Canal, China and Taiwan, very wide ranging. And I learned a lot from it. Thanks. I mean, Steve, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=527.28s)]
*  you're absolutely right. That's just what he loves. This is what he loves. And when Donald Trump had [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=532.88s)]
*  his first term, Lawrence, you remember he told Marco Rubio, you got central South America, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=536.56s)]
*  you handle Cuba. And he totally trusts him with the Venezuela, the regime change that never quite [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=541.28s)]
*  worked out, but never acknowledged Maduro. Now I do talk to him about him. I don't know if it's [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=545.52s)]
*  going to make the cut about Maduro. Are you acknowledging that Maduro is a legitimate leader, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=550.88s)]
*  even though it's a scam election, by getting our hostages out and letting them take their people [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=554.96s)]
*  back? And he said, no, it's a complicated situation. Put it this way. He knows he works [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=562.0s)]
*  for president Trump, but also president Trump likes that he's in charge. Let me tell you, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=566.64s)]
*  Brian, great job with the interview. I love the pairing of secretary Rubio and Donald Trump. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  I've always said that Marco Rubio may be the best communicator from a communication standpoint, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=577.52s)]
*  reaching people, knowing the message of the party in the Republican party. But to pair the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=582.56s)]
*  communication style of Marco Rubio with the policy agenda of Donald Trump, I think we're going to be [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=588.64s)]
*  able to achieve a lot of peace around the world. And I can't wait to see what's next. And even [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  though he has a hand in what's happening in all these countries, allowing us now to send illegals [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=600.16s)]
*  back to their countries, you asked him, you said, is this because of you? And he said it's because [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=605.04s)]
*  of Donald Trump and his policies. You know, one other thing, you know who looks really bad [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=609.68s)]
*  in all this? The Biden team. Essentially, after three years of war, Donald Trump and company really [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=613.92s)]
*  are wrapping it up in about three weeks. So quickly. Yeah. It's unbelievable. So hats off [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=621.28s)]
*  to Marco Rubio and company over at Foggy Bottom. Steve, you make an interesting point because [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  remember the president said that he was going to get it done on day one. Of course, all the media [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=633.92s)]
*  outlets ran with that headline. But one day versus three weeks in the grand scheme of a war [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=638.4s)]
*  that's been over three years, I think the American people got the message. It'll be incredible if [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=645.04s)]
*  this war ends in the next few weeks. A lot of moving parts. Don't get involved in the play by [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=649.52s)]
*  play list. Look at the result. Meanwhile, we'll have more behind the scenes moments with the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  secretary of state on the job just 40 days. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrnTp1Pkl-I&t=658.3199999999999s)]
