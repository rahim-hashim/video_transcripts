# Vet to wildfire survivors: Get your pets ‘the care they need’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is)
*  Fox News alert right now. Deadly raging wildfires scorching through more than 39,000 acres in Los Angeles as fire crews brace for more strong winds on the way which would threaten their progress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=0.0s)]
*  Our next guest runs a California animal shelter opening its doors to people and animals fleeing their home and that are desperately seeking safety. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=11.0s)]
*  Animal Wellness Foundation founder Dr. Annie Harvelis joins us now. Thanks for joining us Annie. Great to see you and who is that you've got there in your lap. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=21.0s)]
*  This is actually my dog but thank you so much for having me on today. I'm actually at home taking a little bit of a break so I'm here with my emotional support animal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=30.0s)]
*  I'm sure you have a lot of obviously you know devastating sad stories but I bet you also have some pretty thrilling stories. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=43.0s)]
*  The stories that I really like to share are the wonderful volunteers that I've had. After I put on my initial post letting people know that I'm opening up my old animal hospital for anybody who's evacuating from the fires. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=53.0s)]
*  We've had this incredible outpouring of support so many people willing to volunteer willing to donate money donate supplies. People who wanted to transport people and I've been getting a lot of emails from people who need help. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=74.0s)]
*  But I've been connecting them right away with people who are willing to help sometimes even within minutes. And it's just it's a beautiful thing how much everyone is coming together as a community to help out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=91.0s)]
*  Annie I'm sure the answer is both. But it's the situation you're finding often owners who now don't have their home and don't have a place to to keep their pet. Or is it that you're finding now newly stray pets who who were were left behind. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=103.0s)]
*  Surely not intentionally but who somehow survived the fires but but but were left behind. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=120.0s)]
*  There's there's definitely been a shift. I've been doing this since Tuesday when the fires first broke out. And originally it was people evacuating fleet fleeing their animal rescue that was burning down their ranch that was burning down. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=126.0s)]
*  It's it's been a shift. And now we're starting to see some stray animals. We took in a dog that was running down the street had broken leg. We did emergency surgery yesterday. We fixed the leg. The dog's going to be fine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=144.0s)]
*  Now we just have to try to find the owner. We've had our first yesterday we had our first smoke inhalation case. So yeah there's there's a shift. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=159.0s)]
*  We're seeing more animals that are showing up that need veterinary care. And you know the beautiful thing is we have a wonderful support staff at our veterinary hospital in Marina Del Rey. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=169.0s)]
*  And we're going to start seeing a lot more patients there that need help from the fire and we're going to do it all for free. So you know anybody that has a pet that has been evacuated evacuated if they need medical care. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=181.0s)]
*  We've had some patients that come in who they forgot to bring their pets medication. And so they come into us and they say we forgot the pets medication. We we can get the medication for you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=196.0s)]
*  You know I want the people of L.A. to know that you're fully supported. Our hospital in Marina Del Rey will do anything you need. But also a lot of other veterinary hospitals are opening their doors as well to people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=207.0s)]
*  So you know please you know get get your get your pet the care they need after evacuation. Dr. Anne I just love this story and just the capacity of animals to bring everyone together. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=220.0s)]
*  Everyone it's the most bipartisan issue there is pets. We love them and you're doing such a great great thing. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you for having me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnVWeRN3Is&t=231.0s)]
