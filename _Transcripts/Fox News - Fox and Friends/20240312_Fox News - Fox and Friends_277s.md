# White House walks back Biden's 'red line' comment
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho)
*  We can't leave a quarter of the Hamas terror army in place there, there, in Rafah. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=0.0s)]
*  This would be equivalent to saying, you know, after the allies fought back, gone through [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=7.68s)]
*  Normandy, went through Germany, and you'd say, well, we'll leave a quarter of the Nazi [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  army in place, and we won't go into Berlin, the last stronghold. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=18.44s)]
*  Look, it's either Israel or Hamas. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  There is no middle way. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=23.72s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defending his nation's right to defeat an [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=25.68s)]
*  enemy sworn to its destruction. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  Now, Israel's planned offensive on Rafah is raising tensions between President Biden [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  and the Israeli leader. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=35.64s)]
*  Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall wrote, saved a war reporter's mission to make it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=37.04s)]
*  home, which is available today in paperback, and run to the store. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=42.28s)]
*  Get it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=46.04s)]
*  Order it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=47.04s)]
*  It is a fabulous book. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=48.04s)]
*  And Benjamin joins us live in the studio now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=49.04s)]
*  What a pleasure to have you here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  I know you're following what's happening in Gaza very closely. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=52.92s)]
*  As we follow sort of the domestic politics here and then the back and forth between Biden [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=57.08s)]
*  and Netanyahu, how is it playing there on the ground? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=61.28s)]
*  Well, I think one of the concerns right now is that the U.S. may be pulling back in a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=65.16s)]
*  sense. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=68.88s)]
*  And I was in Israel just a few weeks ago, and that is a concern for many people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=69.88s)]
*  They understand that everyone I spoke to understands that the reason the IDF are inside Gaza is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=72.96s)]
*  to get rid of Hamas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=77.64s)]
*  And many of them acknowledge that to get rid of Hamas, you have to go into Rafah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=78.64s)]
*  And so the message from President Biden a few days ago that it would be a red line for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=82.56s)]
*  him if they did is concerning for many of them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=85.86s)]
*  You got to be really careful drawing red lines. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=88.9s)]
*  President Obama did it inside Syria, and that backfired on him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=91.1s)]
*  So people are concerned right now about the continuing U.S. support, but they all acknowledge [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=95.1s)]
*  that if you are going to get rid of Hamas, you have to go into Rafah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=99.02s)]
*  And we expect to see that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=101.98s)]
*  So we're just going to play this out here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=102.98s)]
*  Number two and then one, guys. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  This is the president the other day about this red line that may or may not be there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=105.68s)]
*  It is a red line, but I'm never going to leave Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=110.38s)]
*  The defense of Israel is still critical. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=114.3s)]
*  So there's no red line. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=116.32s)]
*  You cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead as a consequence of going out. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=117.98s)]
*  There's other ways to deal to get to to deal with the with with the trauma caused by Hamas. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  So that was over the weekend. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=131.62s)]
*  And then this was yesterday. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  Clean up an aisle for apparently or something. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=134.34s)]
*  Again, I don't think that it's productive to assign a red line sort of terminology to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=136.66s)]
*  a very complex set of policies self before. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=142.74s)]
*  And I think you've heard him say and I'll reiterate here that he thinks that there are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=145.46s)]
*  other approaches which we have taken and are taking that are more effective in obtaining [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=149.34s)]
*  our goals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=153.62s)]
*  I think the point here is that Israel has a vote in this and Netanyahu has shown no [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=154.62s)]
*  inclination to back away from the fight to destroy Hamas in Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  No, he said very clearly that there is a red line for him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  And that is to make sure October 7th never never happens again. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=167.88s)]
*  That was his red line. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=170.98s)]
*  But there was also some perhaps reports that President Biden would be considering reducing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=171.98s)]
*  military aid and assistance to Israel if they did go in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=176.9s)]
*  But then he pulled back again, he said, but not the iron dome system, nothing that would [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=179.62s)]
*  perhaps endanger Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  So the thoughts are what possibly could that be that they are perhaps talking to Israel [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  about. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=188.02s)]
*  But again, it just worries Israelis at the moment. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=189.02s)]
*  Ben, so you are here in America. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=191.38s)]
*  You're talking about the paperback edition of your book and wondering about how sacrifice [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=193.38s)]
*  and survival then help lead you to the podcast, which I think is really great. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=198.14s)]
*  You know, I'm a podcast enthusiast. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=202.38s)]
*  It's Searching for Heroes with Benjamin Hall. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=204.1s)]
*  And it seems sort of seamless to me that you wrote the book, which is an excellent book, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=206.7s)]
*  and now you get to talk about other heroes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=211.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=213.05999999999997s)]
*  One of the great things about the book is that so many people have been far more open [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=214.05999999999997s)]
*  and honest with me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=217.22s)]
*  For whatever reason, they know you've gone through something really difficult and they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=219.1s)]
*  want to share things that they've gone through with you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=221.54s)]
*  So that's where the podcast comes from. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  And I've sat down with countless incredible people who have gone through really difficult [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=224.94s)]
*  things but have come up on the other side stronger. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'm trying to find out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=230.94s)]
*  That's what I want to understand. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=232.58s)]
*  And I've spoken to doctors and people who work in the resilience sector. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=233.58s)]
*  Why do some people come out of difficult situations feeling stronger and why do other people fall [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=238.54s)]
*  off? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=242.5s)]
*  I speak to a lot of veterans who have had injuries like I have and they lose their identity. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=243.5s)]
*  They lose their family bonds. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=246.34s)]
*  They lose things. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=247.94s)]
*  And so what is that difference? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=248.94s)]
*  And that's what I look at in the podcast. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=249.94s)]
*  And also that's what I lay out in the book is that sense of resilience, how you get through [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=251.7s)]
*  difficult things. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=254.22s)]
*  Great stuff and really important stuff too. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=255.22s)]
*  And maybe sometime real soon we'll talk about book number two. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=257.3s)]
*  And you're looking very well and it's so good to see you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=260.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's great to see you too. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=263.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMWjqBvwVho&t=264.06s)]
