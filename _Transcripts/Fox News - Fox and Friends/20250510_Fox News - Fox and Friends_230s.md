# Biden is trying to say, why is Jill making me do this? Rachel Campos-Duffy jokes
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g)
*  Ex-Obama aides are really upset about Joe Biden being out on the, I don't know, you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=0.0s)]
*  call it the trail again, out on the circuit again? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=10.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=13.16s)]
*  Listen, it's like the future and the past is bad for them right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=14.16s)]
*  It's like there's nowhere to turn. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=18.2s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=19.96s)]
*  Knowing what you know now, do you think you would have beat him? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=22.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's still got seven million fewer votes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=25.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=27.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=28.92s)]
*  But it didn't show up. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=29.92s)]
*  Number one, number one. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=30.92s)]
*  Number two, they're very close in those toss-up states. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't slam dunk. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  I think what he's trying to say, Charlie, is I would have won this race. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=45.800000000000004s)]
*  If I could have stayed in the thing, I would have won this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know, I guess for Joe Biden and Joe, they feel like that message right now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=53.6s)]
*  helps them maybe because they got a book deal coming. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=58.720000000000006s)]
*  But Democrats are just not happy to see the old face of the party kind of taking center [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=61.84s)]
*  stage right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=67.68s)]
*  I think what he's trying to say is, why is Jill making me do this? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=68.68s)]
*  Because they're like running out of money and they need this book deal and they need [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  to serve. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=78.12s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=79.12s)]
*  It's so cruel what they're doing here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=80.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, Dan Pfeiffer from Pod Save America co-host, he says that this is just terrible [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=82.64s)]
*  for the Democrat Party watch. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=90.76s)]
*  I find it very aggravating and infuriating, frankly infuriating when he says that he thinks [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=93.72s)]
*  he would have won. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=98.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=99.44s)]
*  Because I feel like that's so, it's politically insane, right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=100.44s)]
*  It's just, it's like detached from reality. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=103.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=105.72s)]
*  And of course, he's not the only one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=107.4s)]
*  Democrat strategist Anthony Coley had this to say in The Hill. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=109.4s)]
*  He was a former spokesman for AG, Merrick Garland. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=115.0s)]
*  Elections are about the future. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  Every time Joe Biden emerges, we fight another old war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=121.04s)]
*  Every interview he does provides a contrast to Trump that's just not helpful for the Democratic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=125.0s)]
*  brand, which needs trusted messengers and fighters who can reach independence and moderates [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=129.0s)]
*  and inspire the base. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=133.72s)]
*  Joe Biden ain't that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=135.2s)]
*  They really do have this incredible problem where you have these scenes of them crashing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  the gates of an ICE facility. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=143.88s)]
*  That's their future. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  And then the past is still with them, which is Joe Biden, who has to figure out some way [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  to sell a book for $30 million to keep his family afloat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=154.48s)]
*  And the fingers point right back at them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  They covered it up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=162.2s)]
*  And so that's why they wanted to go away. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=163.4s)]
*  It's not like they're like, poor Joe, he's falling apart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  It's like, poor Joe, he's falling apart. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=168.44000000000003s)]
*  And we are liars. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  We lied for a long time. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=173.12s)]
*  Well, and it's interesting in that quote you read, he talks about the Democrats need to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  get their brand out there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  They need a better brand messenger. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=179.84s)]
*  But actually, I think the problem is they don't know what their brand is right now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  So they don't like that Joe Biden's carrying a message. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  But I haven't heard anyone actually come out with the message. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=189.06s)]
*  You've heard the oligarchy thing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=192.24s)]
*  You know, that's the Bernie Sanders brand. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=193.84s)]
*  But if that's the brand that's supposed to reach moderates, they've got a bigger problem [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  than just Joe Biden being out doing interviews in the view right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=200.0s)]
*  And the one person who was left there, all of those ladies are liars as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=202.88s)]
*  They've been propping him up along as well, which is why he chose this place. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=208.8s)]
*  This was a very, he knew he was going to get a soft place. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=213.12s)]
*  But even they couldn't cover for him in this interview. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=219.28s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWIQ9a-m5g&t=220.28s)]
