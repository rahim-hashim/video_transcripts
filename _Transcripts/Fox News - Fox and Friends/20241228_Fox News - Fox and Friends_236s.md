# Kathy Hochul has been a 'failed governor all along,' journalist says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI)
*  Governor Kathy Hochul facing backlash for approving a new climate superfund. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=0.0s)]
*  It includes finding fossil fuel companies $75 billion, potentially raising energy prices [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=6.88s)]
*  across New York. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=13.24s)]
*  Experts warn this could spread to other states as President-elect Trump is doubling down [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  on his plans to drill baby drill. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=19.3s)]
*  Here to react is someone who left New York City over its left-wing policies, Carol Markowitz. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=22.18s)]
*  Carol, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, one of my favorite things about failed politicians is when they decide to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=29.86s)]
*  get out of the business of all the things they're actually responsible for and start [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=34.94s)]
*  fooling with things that they have no business fooling with. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=41.06s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right that that's what's happening here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=45.5s)]
*  Kathy Hochul has a very low approval rating. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=48.94s)]
*  Sixty percent of New Yorkers want somebody else in 2026 when she's up for reelection. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  She has been a failed governor all along, and she's very much say do what I say, not [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=57.58s)]
*  what I do. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=61.9s)]
*  She's constantly traveling on private jets and helicopters. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=62.9s)]
*  But for the rest of us, she'd like us to pay higher fuel prices. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=65.78s)]
*  She's really been a failure all around. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=69.46s)]
*  And this is not unique to her. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=71.58s)]
*  Bill de Blasio, the former failed mayor of New York City, wanted to sue oil companies [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=73.5s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=77.78s)]
*  This is a plot basically to get the left aligned with her to say, I hate oil companies the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=78.78s)]
*  way you do. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=83.92s)]
*  Please vote for me. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=84.92s)]
*  It's the look over there strategy, the shiny object strategy trying to get her voters who [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=86.82s)]
*  she thinks had such contempt for. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=92.86s)]
*  She thinks they're so stupid that they'll fall for this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=94.94s)]
*  Of course, the problem here, and this goes to the heart of why you decided to leave the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=97.33999999999999s)]
*  city, is that all of these things end up punishing, they don't punish de Blasio or Hochul. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=102.1s)]
*  They end up punishing the people she claims to be wanting to help. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=109.56s)]
*  In this particular case, $75 billion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that those costs might get conveyed to the residents of her state? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=117.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=123.34s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=124.34s)]
*  I read all the press releases about this, and they all claim that, no, no, they're not [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=125.34s)]
*  going to get passed along to the consumer, which is something somebody says when they've [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=129.86s)]
*  been in the business of government too long and not in the business of business. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=133.06s)]
*  Fossil fuels are a legal enterprise in New York. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  They cannot ban it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=139.78s)]
*  I mean, they can ban it, but they haven't. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  And so to punish these companies and say, we're going to make you pay for a legal product [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=143.32s)]
*  that you provide that makes the lives of New Yorkers better, it's simply unfair. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=147.68s)]
*  I don't know that it's going to pass in the courts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=151.84s)]
*  I don't know that they're going to get this through. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=153.92s)]
*  But just the very idea that these companies are going to take a multi-billion dollar hit [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  and not pass that cost along to consumers is ridiculous. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=160.76s)]
*  And it's only something a politician who has really been in government too long can believe. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  It really does say all you need to know about Kathy Hochul and her brand of politician. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=169.24s)]
*  Let me ask this, Carol. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=174.8s)]
*  So what, it's been what, three, four years since you moved to Florida? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=175.8s)]
*  Almost three. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  Almost three years since you've moved to Florida. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  How many days during the past three years have you regretted moving out of New York [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  City to Florida? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  I really loved New York. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  I really did. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  I was a New York supremacist, lifelong New Yorker. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  I never wanted to leave. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=195.24s)]
*  So I will tell you the only regret I have is that we didn't do it sooner and that these [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=196.56s)]
*  politicians have really ruined my city and my state that I loved so much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=201.26s)]
*  I hope that New Yorkers vote these people out. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=205.84s)]
*  It looks like they're trying to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=208.22s)]
*  In every election, they kind of move a little bit further to the right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=209.6s)]
*  And I love to see it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=212.12s)]
*  I hoped that New York turns itself around. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=213.44s)]
*  I'm rooting for New York. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=215.52s)]
*  I'm not going back, but I'm rooting for New York from afar. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=216.52s)]
*  Let common sense prevail. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=219.58s)]
*  Kara Markowitz, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m2Ytlx_4ZI&t=221.16s)]
