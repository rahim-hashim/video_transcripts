# Senior voter begs for Trump: 'Can't do it another 4 years'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A)
*  Good morning. Welcome to the Village of Romeo in Michigan, home of the Romeo High Bulldogs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=0.0s)]
*  home of Kid Rock, home of Halloween, one of the number one Halloween spots in America. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=15.4s)]
*  It'll be a big parade here and home of a lot of voters. As you know, Michigan, right in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  the middle of the blue wall. Oh, yes. A lot of deplorables, a lot of smelly Walmart people, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=29.08s)]
*  and a lot of trash in here, a lot of garbage, and a lot of early voters. Two million early [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=35.28s)]
*  votes have already been cast, guys, in the state of Michigan with six days to go. It is the center [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=41.68s)]
*  of the blue wall. Well, that's what they say. Trump only needs one of those states. She would [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  need all three. Maybe it will be Michigan for Trump. We will find out, but we're talking to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=53.8s)]
*  voters this morning. It's been a lot of fun, guys. It has been a lot of fun. And of course, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=58.36s)]
*  the fun was actually provided by Joe Biden because he really stepped in it about 36 hours [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=62.56s)]
*  ago when he was talking a little bit about Donald Trump's supporters. And he said this. Watch folks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  From Puerto Rico, where I'm in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=75.44s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization is seen as [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=82.2s)]
*  unconscionable. Yeah. I mean, it's not typical. It's not unusual for him to say things about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=88.2s)]
*  people that support Trump. I mean, he has got a long history of ripping the so-called MAGA [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  supporters. A lot of Democrats do. Well, yesterday I was kind of running around, super busy, and I [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=99.64s)]
*  turn on Fox News and I see Donald Trump in the vest and I see this image of him in the truck, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  and I just started laughing. I thought, oh my gosh, good for him. Whoever thought of this genius idea, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  you said the campaign saying it was Donald Trump's idea. And then I thought, Pete, those Democrats [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  are probably saying, oh my word, shoot, just like you said, Joe Biden stepped in it and now they're [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  taking advantage of it. All day yesterday. I mean, think about it. Kamala Harris goes to the ellipse [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=126.4s)]
*  to try to allude to January 6th and they've been calling him a fascist and a tyrant. But if someone [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=132.56s)]
*  forgot to invite grandpa, and so he was on a Zoom call in the White House and makes a statement [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=138.8s)]
*  about garbage, and now the news cycle is all about that and in a way that only Donald Trump can. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=145.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris couldn't put the vest on and go into the garbage truck, just like Kamala Harris [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=150.24s)]
*  couldn't put the apron on and go into McDonald's. Donald Trump has a touch and a feel for working [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  class blue collar voters. And you see that here in Michigan and you see it across the country, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  he's able to pull off things she can't. And I do think that resonates, guys. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  It's an excellent point, Pete, because it also goes to the point that the former president is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=168.4s)]
*  having fun. The campaign is almost over. He's laughing. He's making jokes about them right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=172.0s)]
*  He's in the McDonald's. He's in the truck. And he's the humor right now when you see dark, dark, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=179.12s)]
*  dark coming from the other side. It was joy. It was joy on the other side. This is real joy now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=187.28000000000003s)]
*  So there you see him and he walked in and it was a great sound bite because, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  and we played a little while earlier, where he said, I wasn't going to wear this safety vest [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=201.12s)]
*  to this rally, but some people in my staff said, it makes you look thinner. And so I'm going to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  wear it. He said, I might never wear it again. You know, Pete and everybody, you've got to figure [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  that at some point Kamala Harris is going to realize, I have gotten some really bad advice. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  Early on, it was avoid the press. Don't do the Al Smith dinner. Don't do Joe Rogan. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=224.56s)]
*  Instead, what does she do? She did in Michigan, actually where you are, Pete, that supposed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=231.92s)]
*  candid bar shot with Gretchen Whitmer, where they knew that there were microphones right there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, I had no idea. There's an authenticity problem with her when it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=246.64s)]
*  comes to the TV stuff. Donald Trump is a TV producer, a TV star. He's really good at it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=254.4s)]
*  Oh, Steve, you're no doubt. And here's the thing. They have a candidate problem, Steve. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=261.2s)]
*  They have, this is not someone who anyone on the Democrat side voted for. She didn't win a primary. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=265.12s)]
*  She didn't earn any votes. She was bestowed by Biden in a spiteful way who knew her political [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=270.0s)]
*  skills. They knew her limitations. So as a result, they curated it. They pushed along the honeymoon [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=275.2s)]
*  and they've counted on the news media. Think of what happened with the comments from Joe Biden. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  They're trying to make it look like he said it about the statements and not about the supporters. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=285.28s)]
*  The apostrophe. It's just like the interview with CBS, the apostrophe, just like the interview [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  with CBS where she gave a terrible answer on Israel. And what did they do? They replaced it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  with an entirely different answer. So they've been counting on a complicit press because their [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  candidate is not good at her job. Probably couldn't, I don't think she could win a spot [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=301.84s)]
*  on the Romeo city council. And that's a problem. That's a problem. How many people are going to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=306.0s)]
*  dress up like that for Halloween tonight? And where do you get those safety vests? Are they [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=312.24s)]
*  sold out at home? I'm going to hit the street here in about half an hour. You have one. I have one. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=316.24s)]
*  You should wear it to a party tonight. Also, when you walk your dog, you should wear some type of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=321.28s)]
*  reflecting material at night. So just a safety note. Also, she did a local interview with an [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=325.04s)]
*  ABC reporter who asked her really direct questions. And most of it was about this. That was a national [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=330.24s)]
*  reporter. That was national reporter. Well, she did it. I think she was caught by surprise. She [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=335.76s)]
*  could not know it wasn't Mary Bruce. It was somebody else. But she got totally by surprise. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  She can't shake this story. No one's talking about the ellipse speech, but here's a little of what [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=345.84s)]
*  she might have missed if she wasn't doing what Trump does. Trump watches her on the stump all the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=350.48s)]
*  time. But Trump last night was with this guy and that Brett Favre watch. How do you like my garbage [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=354.24s)]
*  truck? This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden. And I have to begin by saying 250 million [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=361.6s)]
*  Americans are not garbage. I can assure you we're not garbage. I see everyday Americans [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  that make this country great. I want to thank all of our incredible sanitation workers all across [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=380.16s)]
*  America. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=386.0s)]
*  Because they work hard. They really do work hard. And they do an incredible job and they don't get [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=394.8s)]
*  the credit they deserve like our police, like our firefighters. My response to Joe and Kamala is [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=400.88s)]
*  very simple. You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. That's true. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=407.36s)]
*  And it's just so effective because even if you Pete and Lawrence and Ainsley and Brian, even if [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=416.64s)]
*  you didn't know the story about the garbage truck and the garbage earlier, you'd see him give that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=423.04s)]
*  speech in Green Bay yesterday and then be like, why is he dressed like kind of Bob the Builder? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  And then you'd realize, oh, wait a minute. He's talking a little bit about the message. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=434.4s)]
*  It goes to the larger point though, Pete. Joe Biden was supposed to be the unifying person. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=439.12s)]
*  He was supposed to unite the country as he says, restore the soul. And ever since he's been elected, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=444.96s)]
*  he's this is not the first comment. I mean, the MAGA voters, the MAGA Republicans, like what does [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=451.12s)]
*  that even mean? He's been demonizing the Trump base, the Trump supporters for a while now. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  Oh, a threat to democracy. And here's the thing, Lawrence, you know this better than anybody [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  and everyone on the couch, because you've been out at diners like I have. What you feel in these [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=468.4s)]
*  atmospheres is love. What you feel, same thing that you feel at Trump rallies. This and you're [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=472.8s)]
*  connected by we love God, we love our country, we support those who serve us. We work hard for a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=478.24s)]
*  living. Just the real basic, we all we want is a secure border and a dollar that goes somewhere. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  And our kids to not be having boys going into girls bathrooms. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  It's really basic common sense, but which by the way is an issue in this town. And there's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=495.52s)]
*  I met some school board members who are running to change it. So it's basic stuff that should [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=500.4s)]
*  unite us. And as in return, what do we get? We get called deplorable or smelly Walmart people, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=505.2s)]
*  or you name the issue. In this case, it's garbage. And I think it'll have more of a motivating effect [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=511.44s)]
*  that people think and Donald Trump knows how to leverage it. Well, and Pete, you just went [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=516.4s)]
*  through some of the things that democrats have referred to republicans as through history, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=520.0s)]
*  recent history. Fox News Digital put together a montage of things like that. I thought I was [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=526.16s)]
*  editing this. Oh, yeah, easily did it. So take a look at this. It's French. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=532.72s)]
*  You could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. The racist, sexist, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=538.72s)]
*  homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=545.76s)]
*  People have been beaten down so they feel betrayed by government. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=550.64s)]
*  So it's not surprising that they get better. They claim to guns or religion or [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=557.28s)]
*  antipathy towards people who aren't white men. And it would explain their frustrations. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=564.88s)]
*  White Republican suburban women are now going to vote Republican. Why? It's almost like roaches [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=571.12s)]
*  voting for raid, right? It's they're voting against their own self interest. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=578.0s)]
*  You voted for Trump. You voted for the person who the Klan supported. You voted for the person [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=585.84s)]
*  who Nazis support. You voted for the person who the alt right supports. I don't hate the guy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=593.52s)]
*  I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=600.4s)]
*  I have no respect for you. Class resentment is a lot what and anti intellectualism and elitism [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=605.52s)]
*  is what is driving many of these these anti establishment, which are Trump voters, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=613.6s)]
*  are anti established. Absolutely. So they do all of this, Pete. And then they ask, why can't we [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=620.64s)]
*  never get polling right with Donald Trump and his supporters? Like, why does he always under [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=626.48s)]
*  performing the polling? It's because you spend half of the time going after them. And so when they [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=631.2s)]
*  caught when you call them to ask them who they're going to vote for, you think they're going to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  give you a true answer? I'm going to hang up. Yep. And why are we losing young men? Why are we losing [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=640.48s)]
*  young black men, young Hispanic men, different constituencies, no one wants to be condescended [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  to and they know other people who have lost out because of policies that have affected their [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=652.16s)]
*  community's jobs that have been lost. That matters. And it's one thing to make a decision. It's [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=657.36s)]
*  another thing to be told you're being shamed for making that decision. And that only pushes people [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=662.56s)]
*  in another direction. So you know, what's so interesting is that when they first started [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=668.16s)]
*  vilifying made a MAGA tried to make MAGA a bad word. I think Trump was befuddled by it. He said, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  make America great again is a bad word. That's an accurate. And they said, do you understand? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=678.0s)]
*  It's not just me. It's there's people. Well, I'm not I'm not all Trump supporters, just MAGA [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=682.64s)]
*  supporters and people who vote for Trump say, what are you talking about? That's all of us. If you [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=687.68s)]
*  vote for Trump, I guess, technically, that's his slogan. You're insulting us. But then they moved [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=692.64s)]
*  on from it for him to go back to it. Last night is a nightmare. Notice they don't say felon about [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=698.16s)]
*  Donald Trump anymore than they used to, because there's 30 million felons out in the country. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=705.28s)]
*  Well, any people want a fresh start and then they want to look at the case. The case is so [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=709.52s)]
*  flimsy that the more they looked at it look like a political move. So they want quiet on it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=714.0s)]
*  Pete, that's why this is so damaging. You know what I love about these diners? It is middle [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=718.64s)]
*  America and it's how we all grew up, you know, going to church on Sundays. You moved your whole [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=722.64s)]
*  family down to Nashville because you wanted them to have that southern, a southern education or [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  southern philosophy, southern way of life. And Jen did agree to it. Long Island's becoming so red [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=732.56s)]
*  too. But that's what, and when I was watching Kamala Harris's rally and I saw the young students who [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=739.92s)]
*  were yelling Jesus is Lord and she said you're at the wrong rally. Like middle America is not like [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  that. And you have these coastal elites. She's from California. Look at Hillary Clinton. She used to [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  be from Arkansas and she abandoned all of that and then became a senator of New York and family [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=759.12s)]
*  lives in New York now. New York and California think very differently than the rest of the United [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=765.68s)]
*  States. Well, Pete, you've got a focus group right there. Why don't you talk to folks? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=771.12s)]
*  Absolutely. We'll talk to some folks. And you're exactly right, Ainsley. For modern Democrats, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=776.24s)]
*  government is king. But for most Americans in middle America, Christ is king. And so it's a [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=781.2s)]
*  very different viewpoint. Ma'am, this election, did you vote early? I did. You did. And what issues [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=787.12s)]
*  are you voting on? What's most important to you? Well, in my case, being a senior and speaking for [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=796.48s)]
*  all the seniors here, I need Trump back because during the Biden administration, I had to take [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=801.52s)]
*  a job at 84 years old to subsidize my social security. And I can't do it another four years. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=808.88s)]
*  We need Trump because he's going to save our social security. He's going to save our Medicare. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=820.8s)]
*  It's not going to be spent on the far left. There are issues. Absolutely. Was it inflation that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=826.96s)]
*  hurt the most? Absolutely. I mean, you know, paying what we're paying for groceries and everything [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=834.32s)]
*  and living on a fixed income, it's been really tough. And like I said, I had to take a part-time [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=839.84s)]
*  job just to subsidize my social security. Well, it's good to see you, ma'am. Thank you very much. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=846.32s)]
*  This is our come around over here. This is our bar crew. Been hanging by the bar all morning long. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=852.08s)]
*  Real thoughts. Did you vote early? Good morning. No, I didn't. I'm waiting until the day of the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=857.44s)]
*  polls because I want to make sure my ballot goes in that box. I've heard that a lot this morning. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=862.0s)]
*  What issues are you voting on? What's most important? The economy and the immigration, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=868.8s)]
*  the economy. I'm a small business owner and we're in big trouble. There's some scary times right [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=873.6s)]
*  now. People can't afford to put food on the table, let alone get their kitchen remodeled [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=879.6s)]
*  or go get their back adjusted from a chiropractor. It's really scary for the middle class. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=884.32s)]
*  And with this administration, Trump is promising to bring all that back. He's proved it in his [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=891.6s)]
*  four years of office that he's done everything for the people, period. We need Trump back. We [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=897.6s)]
*  want Trump back. Go vote for Trump. There we go. Just a real quick survey of the room. And it's [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  been a battle between indoor and outdoor. Here I am indoors. Trump says he's going to bring the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  automobile industry back to Michigan. The Michigan miracle. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=918.72s)]
*  Who thinks that's possible here? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=924.64s)]
*  There's a lot of enthusiasm that if you unleash American manufacturing and the obsession with EV [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=929.36s)]
*  mandates, you can really unleash what Michigan and Detroit has done for years, guys. So a lot of [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=935.6s)]
*  fired up folks. Just out of curiosity, Pete, how many people actually drive electric cars in Michigan? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask this good question. Steve Doocy has a question for how many folks in here drive an EV? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=948.48s)]
*  There's your answer. All right. So how many people, does anybody here support the EV mandate? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=958.48s)]
*  No. So it's very clear that issue is a winner for Trump and a loser for Democrats who worship [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=967.0400000000001s)]
*  at the altar. Keep in mind, he's got the number one electric car maker in the world as his [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=971.76s)]
*  chief confidant and a must. Know what he says? Compete. He doesn't say he's not anti-electric [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=977.04s)]
*  cars. Exactly. Go compete and see what your electric bill is, see what works out and just [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  do what's best for you. But don't go out and put your hand on the scale. Thanks so much, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hvX5uWu9A&t=986.0s)]
