# Zuckerberg admits Biden admin pushed for censorship online
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo)
*  A Fox News alert just moments ago met the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=0.0s)]
*  announcing a commitment to free speech online and a shift away from censoring all of us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=6.92s)]
*  That's why it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the U.S. government [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=14.68s)]
*  has pushed for censorship. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=18.96s)]
*  By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=20.84s)]
*  even further. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=25.52s)]
*  But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I am excited to take [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=27.18s)]
*  it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=31.82s)]
*  The company admitting that they were pressured into it over the last four years under the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=33.26s)]
*  Biden administration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=37.34s)]
*  Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins us now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=38.34s)]
*  Hey, Jonathan, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=41.26s)]
*  Hi, Ainsley. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=42.86s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=43.86s)]
*  What is your reaction to this and why do you think they're doing this now? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=44.86s)]
*  Well, that's the most interesting aspect of this story. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  I just wrote a book, The Indispensable Right, that talks about Facebook met on the social [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=51.66s)]
*  media companies. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=56.36s)]
*  And we all love a redemptive sinner. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=57.76s)]
*  It's just that it would be great if that occurred before you were caught. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=60.36s)]
*  And we have a great deal of information now that does not really support the argument [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=64.2s)]
*  by Zuckerberg that they were unwilling partners forced into this by the Biden [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=70.68s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=74.84s)]
*  They resisted calls from many of us for years to join Elon Musk, reveal, for example, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=76.56s)]
*  the Facebook files, which they resisted. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=83.76s)]
*  They fought at every stage not to be transparent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=86.16s)]
*  And that finally collapsed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=89.84s)]
*  Now, that criticism aside, this is an important moment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=92.04s)]
*  You know, Musk has been out there taking these slings and arrows throughout this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=96.48s)]
*  process as the only social media company that went in all went full in on free [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=102.48s)]
*  speech. Zuckerberg would be a powerful ally. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=110.04s)]
*  It would be a wonderful change. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=112.88s)]
*  You know, Facebook funded a really creepy campaign years ago trying to get young [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=114.64s)]
*  people to embrace what they call content moderation, what some of us call [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=120.16s)]
*  censorship. And it really failed in a spectacular fashion. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=124.2s)]
*  It would be great if Zuckerberg could join Musk and create this powerful alliance [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=128.64s)]
*  for free speech. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=134.76s)]
*  Well, Joel Kaplan, he is Metta's chief global affairs officer. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=136.96s)]
*  He was on with us. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=140.68s)]
*  And this is what he said. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=142.36s)]
*  I'll play a clip and then we'll get your reaction on the other side. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=143.48s)]
*  There's no question that there's an opportunity here with a new president [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=146.92s)]
*  taking office, as I said, who really believes in free expression. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=150.72s)]
*  And that's just going to give us the space to get back to those values that Mark has [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=154.0s)]
*  talked about for a long time. Mark gave a big speech six years ago at Georgetown [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=158.48s)]
*  about free expression, about these values. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=161.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, you know, there's been a lot of political and societal pressure here [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=164.8s)]
*  and around the world that have pushed away from those values. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=169.56s)]
*  We've got a real opportunity to reset, get back to them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=172.52s)]
*  There's a real opportunity here with President Trump coming into office with his [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=175.32s)]
*  commitment to free expression for us to get back to those values and really provide [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=178.96s)]
*  space for people to have the kind of discourse and debate they want to have. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=182.72s)]
*  Will it work, Jonathan? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=186.28s)]
*  Well, when I heard that and this was a great interview on Fox, I was really sent [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  to chill up my spine because it made me wonder what if Trump wasn't elected? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=194.2s)]
*  What if this was the Harris administration? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=198.0s)]
*  I wrote a column earlier that the Biden administration was the most anti-free [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=201.36s)]
*  speech administration since John Adams. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=205.04s)]
*  But Kamala Harris promised to outdo that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=207.56s)]
*  And you really wonder, hearing that interview, what they would have done if, in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=210.84s)]
*  fact, the election came out differently. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=215.84s)]
*  The public spoke very loudly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=217.72s)]
*  And so that's the reason I'm hoping, regardless of the motivation, regardless of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  the fact that it's belated, we need help. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=224.08s)]
*  This is the most this is the largest anti-free speech movement in the history of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=226.96s)]
*  our country. I talk about that in the book. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=231.36s)]
*  It's sweeping over Europe. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=233.52s)]
*  Free speech is collapsing in Europe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  We this is going to be the line of defense for free speech. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=237.6s)]
*  We're it. We stop it here or it doesn't get stopped. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  And look what's happening in Canada. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=244.28s)]
*  The liberal ideals are not working. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=246.12s)]
*  We saw that yesterday. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=248.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  Trudeau is stepping down and now the Conservatives winning by a landslide. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=249.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, Jonathan, for coming on. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=253.72s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=255.56s)]
*  Thanks, Ainsley. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrjU3iRcFo&t=257.48s)]
