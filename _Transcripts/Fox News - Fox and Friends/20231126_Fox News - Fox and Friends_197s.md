# Hamas hostage releases designed to 'maximize anguish' for families, expert warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY)
*  Coming in with a Fox News alert, a temporary ceasefire in Gaza. Now on its third day as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=0.0s)]
*  part of the deal to free more innocent hostages from Hamas terrorists and bring them back [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=7.0s)]
*  to Israel today. 13 were finally freed in yesterday's second round reuniting with their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=12.4s)]
*  loved ones and 13 the day before. But no Americans yet. Retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=17.76s)]
*  Rob Spalding joins us now. General, thank you for joining us. I really want to ask you, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=24.88s)]
*  you know, you're as a member of the Air Force, you understand the surveillance side of things [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=30.84s)]
*  probably a little bit more than myself as a Marine. I really want to ask you about the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=34.8s)]
*  tactical side of this. We have talked about the diplomacy and the hostages a lot. What [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  we haven't talked about is what Israel gave up strategically and tactically on the battlefield [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  in order to let this swap happen. The one thing I found incredibly interesting that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=48.96s)]
*  we haven't talked much about is this idea that Israel halted their aerial surveillance. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=53.24s)]
*  That was a demand from Hamas, which obviously is very important. But my question is, does [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=58.08s)]
*  Hamas even have the ability to know if they're being surveyed, surveilled, you know, with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=62.68s)]
*  some of the assets that Israel may have? Well, I mean, that's a great question. I doubt they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=67.28s)]
*  could tell you that, you know, satellites are observing them from space and that that's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  part of the aerial surveillance. So it's not just aircraft. It's also from space. But, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=77.92s)]
*  you know, I think these hostage returns have been designed to maximize anguish for the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=82.84s)]
*  families and thereby increase the pressure on Israel to pause this. And as long as it's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=90.16s)]
*  paused, Hamas is able to rebuild infrastructure and put themselves in position to make it [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=95.92s)]
*  even more deadly for IDF troops. You know, you've worked in the White House for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=102.72s)]
*  sure, the Trump administration. You understand the tensions that can be in the administration [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=106.36s)]
*  trying to do something like this so sensitive. I think we've talked a lot about Biden putting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=110.72s)]
*  pressure probably on Israel to get hostages back, to be a part of the ceasefire. What [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=115.76s)]
*  does that atmosphere look like in the White House? What kind of pressure is the White [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=121.2s)]
*  House feeling right now? Well, I mean, think about it. What we've done, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=124.48s)]
*  you know, not just from the from the government perspective, but now it's in our institution. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=129.16s)]
*  So if you go back all the way to the end of the Cold War, you know, some of the leaders [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=134.28s)]
*  from Eastern European countries that were liberated from the Soviet Union came to United [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=138.16s)]
*  States. They went to Voice of America. They went to Radio for Europe. They said, thank you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=143.08s)]
*  for speaking the truth. Today, our institutions are entirely the opposite. Our university systems [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=147.52s)]
*  are supporting Hamas. Our social media is supporting Hamas. And so as long as this drags on, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=153.12s)]
*  you know, all of this pressure is not just coming in terms of, hey, let's return the let's return [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=159.68s)]
*  the hostages, but let's support Hamas because, you know, they're, you know, they're they're under, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=164.72s)]
*  you know, so much pressure and we need to, you know, be think of them. Even chat GPT is supportive [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=171.36s)]
*  of Hamas. So I think our AI is being trained this way. This is a big problem. It's an ideological [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=178.24s)]
*  fight, much more so than just a fight with Hamas. And we need to get after it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=184.0s)]
*  General, thank you for leading troops in your career and serving our country. Thank you for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=189.04s)]
*  coming on today, sharing some of your expertise with us. We appreciate you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oBknMwmDPY&t=193.12s)]
