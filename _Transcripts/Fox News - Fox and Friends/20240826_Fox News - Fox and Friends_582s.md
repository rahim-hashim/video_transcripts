# Trump, Harris campaigns spar over hot mics at debate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0)
*  Here we go. We start with President Biden leaving his California vacation for another [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=0.0s)]
*  one in Delaware. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=7.36s)]
*  Trump both hit the campaign trail in several key battleground states. And Peter Doocy is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=12.4s)]
*  at the White House with the latest. Hey Peter. Good morning. And if you saw this photo, you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=18.04s)]
*  would assume the President Biden is here walking out of the Oval Office and through the Rose [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=22.88s)]
*  Garden for a private moment with his partner, the Vice President, especially since the caption [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=26.66s)]
*  says we're working for you. But the President is not here. He left his California vacation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=31.82s)]
*  for a Delaware vacation. Vice President Harris is in town, but we don't expect to see much [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=37.22s)]
*  of her till Wednesday and Thursday. She will be in Georgia both those days, her only battleground [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  of the week. Trump plans to visit Virginia and Michigan today, Wisconsin and Michigan [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  Thursday, then Pennsylvania Friday. Their first in-person meeting is supposed to be [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=52.26s)]
*  September 10th for an ABC debate. The Harris campaign is now telling Politico that unlike [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=56.62s)]
*  last time for Trump v Biden, they would prefer the mics to be hot the entire time, no muting. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=60.82s)]
*  An advisor is quoted as saying they think Trump wants the mics muted, but there might [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=67.17999999999999s)]
*  not be a debate at all. After an ABC interview of Tom Cotton yesterday, that Trump did not [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=71.74s)]
*  questioning now on truth social why he should participate in an ABC debate at all. Back [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=77.14s)]
*  to you. Peter, I just got a text message from your mother. Do you have a cold? No, I think [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=83.82s)]
*  I just had something in my throat. I'm good. All right. Mom, thank you. All right. Just [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=90.82s)]
*  one other quick question for you. You talked a little bit about the potential debate on [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=95.9s)]
*  September the 10th. They might leave the mics hot. Kamala Harris, in the meantime, heard [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=99.22s)]
*  one of her press people was on with yesterday with Howie on Media Buzz and said she definitely [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=105.3s)]
*  will do an interview before the end of this week and that she has done 80 interviews so [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  far this year. Does that little 10 seconds that you talked to her a couple of days ago, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=117.46s)]
*  does that count as one of the 80? If it does, we should talk to promos and hype it as an [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=123.22s)]
*  exclusive. No, but it's if you're the Harris team, it's smart because they pushed it off, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=128.98s)]
*  pushed it off to the last three day weekend when people are not paying attention before [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=134.54s)]
*  the election. And so if there is an issue, if she makes a mistake, it's going to get [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=140.02s)]
*  a lot less scrutiny right away than if they do it after the first week of the NFL football, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=145.26s)]
*  like on that Sunday night. Well, Peter, her campaign is saying that she's changed her [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=152.26s)]
*  mind on some of these issues like fracking. She's no longer against fracking or she's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  not going to take away our private health insurance companies. Who was saying that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=161.22s)]
*  Is it just anonymous sources or did you get names of people in the campaign? Like, how [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=165.1s)]
*  do we know she really feels this way? Because we haven't heard from her. She has not said [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=168.94s)]
*  that out loud. I have emailed as things have come up, many different people that are working [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  in Wilmington and they will tell us that on background, which basically just means on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=179.34s)]
*  behalf of the campaign, they will tell us that her position has changed. But we have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=183.46s)]
*  heard the words come out of her mouth and depending on who she does the interview with, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=188.74s)]
*  we might not because the way that a lot of these interviews go and based on what the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  convention program was, chances are it could be a lot about Trump and not a lot about how [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=198.22000000000003s)]
*  different her 2019 statements are to 2024. Well, yeah, it's coming up without her even [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  on the Sunday shows, which you would think be friendly environments. So I can't imagine [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  outside Oprah or Rachel Maddow, how that would not come up. I mean, Lester Holt and these [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=214.94000000000003s)]
*  guys, Jake Tapper, they seem to be want to ask. They're asking those questions hypothetically [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=219.78s)]
*  because he won't appear on their shows either. The reason I think that is because for the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=225.46s)]
*  last four years, I keep like a running list of questions for Joe Biden and I have watched [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=229.46s)]
*  interview after interview that he has done sit downs and pretty much none of them get [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=235.3s)]
*  answered. Yeah. And do we asked or answered? Indeed. And do we have any idea who the person [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  might be who gets the interview? Not yet. Okay. All right. Thank you so much, Peter. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=244.3s)]
*  Glad you're healthy. Yes. It's been 36 days since she jumped into the campaign and has [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=250.06s)]
*  not had a sit down interview. People do have questions about her policy because we heard [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=255.74s)]
*  her at the DNC. She just bashed Donald Trump and they all talked about abortion, the abortion [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  issue, but never talked about what her policies are going to be. If you go on her website, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=264.5s)]
*  her policies are not listed. Tom Cotton sat down on one of the Sunday shows and he says [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=268.5s)]
*  we all deserve to see her in an interview. Listen. When she campaigned for president [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=273.02000000000004s)]
*  in her own right, she did in fact promise things like decriminalizing illegal immigration [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=279.5s)]
*  and taking away. That's his position. She's clearly changed on and she said she has changed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yes. She has not. She has not said that she's not. You pointed out Senator Sanders [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=289.1s)]
*  repeatedly things that her campaign has said. Anonymous AIDS speaking on background to reporters [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=295.1s)]
*  has said, well, she no longer believes these things. Okay. Maybe she has changed her position [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=302.1s)]
*  on things like taking away your health insurance and confiscating your gun. If she has changed [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=306.66s)]
*  her position, she owes it to the American people to come out and say her own words, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=311.26000000000005s)]
*  when she changed and why she changed. That's one reason why she needs to address the American [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=316.98s)]
*  people and speak to these questions. Yeah. One of the many reasons, right? And I laughed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=322.5s)]
*  too because this guy, another one of these pollsters said, I don't think you should talk [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=327.1s)]
*  to press at all because she's doing good the way she is right now. She should be talking [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=331.76s)]
*  to the people. She doesn't talk to the people. She talked to them, doesn't hear any of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=337.28s)]
*  questions. She's not listening to the people. She goes and gives a speech in front of a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=341.32s)]
*  supportive crowd. Teleprompter. Right. Through a teleprompter. By the way, I'm not too sure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=344.28s)]
*  This is her momentum is done. Trump had it in July. She had it in August, but now it's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=348.76s)]
*  flat footed tie. And in places like, I don't know if you've seen the CNN, New York Times [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=354.18s)]
*  Ball in Georgia, Trump's up six. So there's a push and there'll be a bump from this. But [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=357.72s)]
*  after this, I think people are really going to have a discerning look at what exactly [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=363.72s)]
*  she stands for because you can't even dispute what she stands for because you don't know [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=367.36s)]
*  what Kamala Harris you're fighting. Are you fighting the vice president? Are you fighting [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  the senator? Are you fighting this new person who's running on Donald Trump's issues like [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=377.6s)]
*  strong on the border, fighting crime, a strong defense, red, white and blue? Excuse me. It's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=383.68s)]
*  like David Plouffe came in there and said, the reason why Trump is popular is because [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  of these things. So let's give him to Harris. And I think the most egregious example was [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  the tips, but I didn't know that was the tip of the iceberg of the of the theft of the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=398.04s)]
*  Republican Party. Well, both sides know that the debate aside from this interview that's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  supposedly going to happen in the next five days, the debate could change the trajectory [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=409.52s)]
*  of the race because after the this interview, then there's going to be one debate that we [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=413.84s)]
*  know of, although Donald Trump is suggesting maybe he might not do it after whatever he [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  saw on ABC. So ultimately, if that changes the trajectory, the less she says, the better. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=422.32s)]
*  So I get what the pollster is saying. But at the same time, Tom Cotton is right. All [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=430.4s)]
*  we know, the only words we have heard her that have come out of her mouth were things [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=435.36s)]
*  that she said about her policy in 2019. And for Peter Ducey to just say that he's heard [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  from people close to her in the campaign, but it's all on background. That is how they [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=445.76s)]
*  are programming the press. They're saying, OK, on background, this is she's changed her [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  position. But we need to hear her say, I changed my position. How are we supposed to believe [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden ran on being a moderate. He was going to unite our country. Our country has [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=463.12s)]
*  never been this divided since I can remember. It didn't work. He lied to the American people. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=466.24s)]
*  He ended up voting in such a progressive manner. And how do we know she's not going to do that? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=472.0s)]
*  That's the way she stood throughout the political her entire political career. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=476.72s)]
*  Here's the hope. They keep booking people like Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, JD Vance on [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=480.92s)]
*  the other networks where they get their point out. These hosts have nothing to stand on. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=485.08000000000004s)]
*  Jonathan Karl is a pretty adept guy, but he has no follow up because he knows Tom Cotton's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=488.92s)]
*  one hundred and ten percent right. You can sit there and say, why did Donald Trump didn't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=492.88s)]
*  say this or that the whole time? But at one point, when you invite other people on, you're [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=496.2s)]
*  going to hear it. And there's independents and undecides that watch those networks. And [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=500.6s)]
*  when his surrogates go out there, you know, the governor, Bergman and others, they like [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=504.6s)]
*  Marco Rubio when he comes back. I guess he's on vacation now. When you book these guys [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=509.72s)]
*  you get the other side. So that's the hope for. Meanwhile, also I'd say this front page [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=514.52s)]
*  in The New York Times. The first gentleman is a sex symbol. Please. The second gentleman, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=519.96s)]
*  second gentleman, he wants to be the first gentleman. OK, he says he's a sex symbol. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=527.52s)]
*  When when he when Doug, what's his last name? Emhoff. Emhoff is a sex symbol. I think where [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=531.88s)]
*  I mean, this that goes beyond reproach. And this is a New York Times. There's a third [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvQH_Kjw-0&t=537.4399999999999s)]
