# Father Mike Schmitz: Concept of God is again a ‘viable option’ in culture
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk)
*  America's decline in Christianity appears to be slowing down for the first time in nearly 20 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=0.0s)]
*  Pew Research Center finding that 62 percent of Americans identified as Christian last year. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=8.0s)]
*  That's a number that has remained stable since 2019. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=14.0s)]
*  Father Mike Schmitz is the Young Adult Ministry Director for the Duluth Minnesota Diocese, and he joins us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=19.0s)]
*  Good morning, Father. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=25.0s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=26.0s)]
*  So this is so interesting. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=27.0s)]
*  It appears that, you know, the number of people who were saying they were Christian or faith-filled or religious was declining. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=29.0s)]
*  It's now stabilized. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=38.0s)]
*  Here's what I dug into the numbers of what I found. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=40.0s)]
*  And we'll put up some of these, a poll right here so you can see some of it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=43.0s)]
*  You know, 86 percent still believe in the existence of the soul, 83 percent in God, universal spirit. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=46.0s)]
*  I'm fascinated by all this, especially because I think we're more faith-oriented than other countries and nations, especially in Europe. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=52.0s)]
*  But I'm interested in the male part of this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=60.0s)]
*  It appears that when you dig into the numbers, it's young men that are driving that stability. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=63.0s)]
*  In other words, their numbers are going up, which is helping to stop this lowering of numbers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=68.0s)]
*  So talk to me because you're on campus. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=75.0s)]
*  What's happening to young men? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=78.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think it's fascinating and I can completely see it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=80.0s)]
*  I think that there's something I think there's something that in the human heart that the human soul in spirit that that longs for something more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=84.0s)]
*  And so when there isn't anything more offered, anything more than just, hey, here is financial success. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=92.0s)]
*  Here's worldly success. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=97.0s)]
*  Here is just success on a playing field, the sports field. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=98.0s)]
*  If nothing more is offered, then nothing more will be reached for. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=102.0s)]
*  But I think that what I've seen is I've seen former people and in many ways our culture has allowed the concept of God to once again be presented as a viable option and not only as a viable option, but as something that actually is worth that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=106.0s)]
*  God himself is worth reaching for, is worth aspiring towards and that a life of holiness is possible. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=123.0s)]
*  And then in that context, when you get to be able to declare and proclaim Jesus Christ, I think the response of so many young men is yes, that that is the model that I want to follow. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=129.0s)]
*  That's that's the kind of man I want to be. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=141.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so much of what's offered to them, whether it's through technology, it's just it's so it's so non fulfilling that I can see why they would be drawn drawn to that and it being sort of countercultural as well. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=143.0s)]
*  Let's talk about Lent because on Wednesday is the start of Lent. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=157.0s)]
*  So what would you say to anyone who's watching our show right now who's like, you know what? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=161.0s)]
*  This time this Lent, I'm going to have a more meaningful Lent. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=165.0s)]
*  I'm going to, you know, really use these 40 days to grow and walk closer to Jesus. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=169.0s)]
*  What would you recommend they think about over the next couple of days before it starts on Ash Wednesday this week? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=174.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love that question. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=180.0s)]
*  So I think a lot of times have you, Rachel, you know, the term asceticism, a phrase or term. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=182.0s)]
*  So I like ascetical practices, asceticism is things we typically associate with Lent. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=187.0s)]
*  So that's, you know, fasting, prayer, almost giving those kind of things. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=192.0s)]
*  But I was digging in deeply to the word asceticism. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=196.0s)]
*  Asceticism comes from a Greek word, asesis, which means training. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=200.0s)]
*  And I think, OK, wait, what if I didn't have that that sense of, OK, this Lent, you know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=205.0s)]
*  I'm going to be a little bit holier, a little maybe a little nicer. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=210.0s)]
*  I'm going to, you know, restrict my food or whatever the thing is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=213.0s)]
*  What if my mentality was this this Lent? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=217.0s)]
*  I'm going to train like I'm training for something. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=220.0s)]
*  And I have a, you know, you know, the difference between like working out and training, working out is good. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=223.0s)]
*  I'm exercising. Training is I have a goal and I want to be able to finish a marathon. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=227.0s)]
*  My goal is I want to do a triathlon. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=232.0s)]
*  My goal is whatever the thing is. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=234.0s)]
*  I think sometimes you walk into Lent without a goal, without a vision. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=235.0s)]
*  Right. And the vision that the church gives us is, OK, at the end of this Lent, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=239.0s)]
*  how can you and I look a little bit more like Christ? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=243.0s)]
*  And so as I enter into Ash Wednesday and go throughout Lent is OK, what's my training going to be? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=246.0s)]
*  And it could be the sense that I really see that I'm really distracted. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=251.0s)]
*  Like I'm when I'm with people, I'm not really with people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=255.0s)]
*  OK, so what could my training be? My training might be, OK, I'm going to get rid of some distractions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=258.0s)]
*  So maybe social media stuff, but also could be something like, OK, when I'm with someone, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=263.0s)]
*  I am going to resolve to look them in the eye. I'm going to listen to them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=268.0s)]
*  I'm going to be where my feet are, you know, kind of that kind of situation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=271.0s)]
*  I can realize that, oh, my heart isn't actually like Jesus. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=274.0s)]
*  Well, how does my heart become like Christ's? Well, do I spend any time with him? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=277.0s)]
*  So this 15 minutes a day that I'm praying isn't just because, you know, it's good to pray, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=281.0s)]
*  but it's because if I pray, my heart will become like his. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=286.0s)]
*  If I spend time with him, then I'll start to look like him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=290.0s)]
*  So training this lent, I think could be a good lens to look at. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=293.0s)]
*  I think it's a really, really good way to look at it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=296.0s)]
*  It's sort of like a Jesus boot camp, if you will. Yeah, I like that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=299.0s)]
*  I like it. Well, we're on the verge of lent. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=303.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. And I hope that we all learn from all your wise lessons. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=307.0s)]
*  Thanks so much, Father. Thanks, Rachel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=311.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dmIlIGNCk&t=320.0s)]
