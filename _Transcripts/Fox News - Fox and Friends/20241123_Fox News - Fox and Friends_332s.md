# ‘Traumatizing’: Georgia mother speaks out after arrest over 10-year-old walking alone
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk)
*  A mother of four was arrested and could face a year in jail after her then 10 year old [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=0.0s)]
*  son was walking alone in their small town in Georgia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=10.4s)]
*  You're under arrest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=14.36s)]
*  For what? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=16.36s)]
*  For the incident we talked about earlier today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=17.36s)]
*  What am I under arrest for? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=19.44s)]
*  For reckless endangerment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=20.78s)]
*  And how was I recklessly endangering my child? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=22.62s)]
*  We're not talking about it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=24.62s)]
*  Call mommy and tell them they're taking you to jail because you decided to walk down the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=26.42s)]
*  street. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=30.62s)]
*  That's not his fault. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=31.62s)]
*  Brittany Patterson and her lawyer David DeLugas joins us now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=34.14s)]
*  Wow, Brittany, David, I'm so glad to have you on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=38.58s)]
*  Brittany, I can't tell you how outraged I am looking at that video of you being arrested. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=41.94s)]
*  By the way, this is the same government, I know this is a state government, but our country [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=47.86s)]
*  to walk across our border alone and your child was going to the grocery store in a little [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=53.7s)]
*  town. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=58.580000000000005s)]
*  Just before we talk about what happened, how traumatizing has this been for your family? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=60.38s)]
*  It's definitely been a little traumatizing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=66.76s)]
*  My kids have never seen anything like that or been exposed to anything like that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  So really their first encounter with police or law enforcement to see them taking their [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=75.78s)]
*  mother out of their home in handcuffs I think was pretty traumatizing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=81.66s)]
*  So your son was 10 years old. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=85.14s)]
*  You didn't give him permission to go, but had he asked you if he could walk to that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=87.06s)]
*  store, would you have allowed him to go? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=91.1s)]
*  I probably would have, yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=94.82s)]
*  And so why do you think law enforcement is pursuing this? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  I should let people know. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  Law enforcement says they'll drop the charges if you agree to put a GPS tracker on your [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=101.82s)]
*  son's phone, on your phone so you can track your son. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  Why is law enforcement pursuing this? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=110.54s)]
*  What is going on in this town? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=112.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  I can't begin to understand what's going on in their minds. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  So that's a mystery to me as well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=120.4s)]
*  But I do want to clarify that they never officially in writing or verbally have offered to drop [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  any charges. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  They said, you know, possibly maybe if I signed the safety plan, but that was never anything [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  official in writing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=136.3s)]
*  David, you're the lawyer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=137.9s)]
*  What are the next steps for this family? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=141.46s)]
*  And is the message to parents, at least in this community, that unless you're watching [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=143.46s)]
*  your kids 100% of the time, you're a bad, negligent parent? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=147.46s)]
*  Thank you for having us on. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=152.5s)]
*  The answer is parents everywhere need to be concerned because somebody with a uniform, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=155.7s)]
*  a badge, and a gun can go get in a restaurant at any time for anything. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=161.14s)]
*  And here, the statute she was charged with was declared unconstitutional by the Georgia [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=165.06s)]
*  Department of Justice in 1997. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=170.54s)]
*  So that's problematic. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=173.54s)]
*  This deputy also told her, yes, it's illegal for someone 10 to walk and that it's clearly [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  not. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=181.06s)]
*  By the way, he was 11 within a few days. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=182.06s)]
*  And the irony here, too, is the next day was Halloween, where kids walk, often without [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=185.54s)]
*  their parents, door to door in the dark and knock on the doors of strangers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  And he was there all of the day, just walking down the street, nine-tenths of a mile. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  So the safety plan, it does not make him more safe. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=202.1s)]
*  And also, by the way, he wasn't unsafe to begin with. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=206.9s)]
*  So for those viewers who are thinking, well, just sign the safety plan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=211.06s)]
*  No other parent in the state is required to put a GPS device on their child's phone, who [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=215.06s)]
*  then later made, by the way, delete the app, the battery runs out, they forget to bring it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  So if you want to put a GPS tracker on your kid's phone, that's fine. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=226.54s)]
*  But for the government to tell you, the state or the county to tell you to do it is a whole [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  other thing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=233.98s)]
*  You know, Brittany, this has sparked such a larger conversation about free-range childhood [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=234.98s)]
*  versus this bubble-wrapped helicopter childhood. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=240.38s)]
*  So just give me for a second your thoughts on that, because I think that's the conversation [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  a lot of other parents are having, besides the government interference, which we can [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=249.62s)]
*  all agree on. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's an important conversation, because the reality is that as parents, we [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=255.1s)]
*  should have that autonomy, whether we want to wrap our kids in bubble wrap or whether [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=260.74s)]
*  we want to give our kids a little more freedom and autonomy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=264.94s)]
*  It should be our decision as parents and not the decision of some government authority [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=268.32s)]
*  who doesn't even know our kids or know our family. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=273.94s)]
*  So I do think this conversation is very important because I am starting to realize that this [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=276.5s)]
*  has been happening for a long time and it's much more prevalent than I definitely than [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=282.94s)]
*  I realize and then I think most people realize. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=288.58s)]
*  So as parents, I think we should all be concerned about that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=291.7s)]
*  Well, God bless you, Brittany. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=295.02s)]
*  I'm really sorry your family had to go through this, that your children had to see you getting [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=296.98s)]
*  arrested. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=300.18s)]
*  It's just it's just unbelievable. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=301.86s)]
*  By the way, Fox News reached out to the Fanning County Sheriff's Office for comment. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=303.02s)]
*  They said they do not comment on pending cases. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=307.26s)]
*  Brittany Patterson, David DeLugas, thanks for bringing this to our attention. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=311.38s)]
*  A lot of parents are paying attention. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=314.82s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=316.38s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=317.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=318.46s)]
*  God bless you and happy Thanksgiving. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=319.46s)]
*  Awful. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXxgyl7Jsk&t=320.46s)]
