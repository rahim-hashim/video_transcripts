# Secret Service agents are not properly trained to protect candidates, whistleblowers claim
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns)
*  So we begin with a shocking omission from Secret Service whistleblowers who claim agents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=0.0s)]
*  are woefully unprepared to provide security for candidates. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=5.64s)]
*  So one whistleblower says the training has not improved even since the assassination [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=9.56s)]
*  attempt on former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=13.76s)]
*  Brooke Singman is here with all the details for us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=16.32s)]
*  Hey Brooke. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Hey guys, yeah, so whistleblowers are telling Missouri Senator Josh Hawley that Secret Service [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  personnel are not properly trained to protect candidates. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=22.86s)]
*  So these whistleblowers said that Homeland Security agents, not Secret Service agents, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=26.58s)]
*  were assigned to work on those protective details at former President Trump's Butler, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=31.5s)]
*  Pennsylvania rally. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=35.78s)]
*  So they say that the agents were only given a single two-hour online training to prepare. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=36.78s)]
*  The training video was pre-recorded and some said the videos were riddled with tech failures. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=42.54s)]
*  One whistleblower told Senator Hawley, quote, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=47.9s)]
*  that everyone needed to log in individually. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=56.54s)]
*  Once it got rolling, the Secret Service instructor couldn't figure out how to get the audio [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=59.22s)]
*  working on the pre-recorded videos. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=63.18s)]
*  They restarted the videos approximately six times and those whistleblowers say the content [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=65.5s)]
*  ultimately was not helpful. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=70.58s)]
*  I'm told that actually agents, Homeland Security agents, were pulled off of child exploitation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=73.9s)]
*  cases, child endangerment cases, the stuff they normally do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=79.1s)]
*  They don't normally do protective detail work at all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=82.7s)]
*  They were pulled off those cases, said here, you're going to go guard the former president [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=85.02s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=88.34s)]
*  Watch this webinar. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  Oops, it doesn't really work. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  Go out into the field anyway. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  Jesse, this is a nightmare and we still have no answers. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  The only reason we know this stuff is because of whistleblowers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  So Wilden, those whistleblowers say that the webinars have still not been updated since [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=100.3s)]
*  the assassination attempt on former President Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  Guys. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=107.66s)]
*  All right, Brooke, thank you very much. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=108.66s)]
*  So yesterday, Congressman Clay Higgins, did you hear what he had to say, Republican from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=110.3s)]
*  Louisiana? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=115.42s)]
*  You know, we've all heard that it was a Secret Service sniper who killed the shooter, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=116.42s)]
*  Well, apparently the first person to shoot was a local SWAT contractor, operator. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  Apparently as soon as the shots started, this guy who was on the ground, a local SWAT guy, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=129.78s)]
*  on the ground, he realizes where the guy is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=136.88s)]
*  He starts running toward him, shoots the guy and disables his gun. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=139.64s)]
*  So he was able to squeeze the shooter, squeezed off like eight shots. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  And then this guy disabled his gun. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=149.54s)]
*  He essentially shot his gun and then the Secret Service SWAT guy killed him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=151.4s)]
*  We didn't know that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=156.78s)]
*  Important context. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=158.4s)]
*  After listening to Brooke's report, there should be no excuse for this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=159.4s)]
*  They have to fix these problems within the Secret Service. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=162.38s)]
*  These candidates, I'm sure both of them are getting so many threats. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=164.84s)]
*  Well, the problem is they need to go back to the original origin, which is to keep the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=167.72s)]
*  president safe. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=171.04s)]
*  None of all these initiatives and all that, you need people that can actually do the job. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=172.04s)]
*  There's no reason why you should be taking agents from Homeland Security that aren't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=176.12s)]
*  prepared for protection details to do this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=181.12s)]
*  We saw agents that day that did not know how to host their weapons. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  That is not cool. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=187.24s)]
*  Well, maybe the webinar on what to do when there's a shooter on a roof, maybe they weren't [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=188.24s)]
*  able to get the audio up on that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=193.8s)]
*  I was surprised. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=195.72s)]
*  Do they normally do this training over Zoom or over? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=196.72s)]
*  No. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=199.0s)]
*  Don't you, aren't you supposed to go to the site? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's agents, usually it's Secret Service guys. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=204.4s)]
*  These were from a whole different department. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=205.4s)]
*  People couldn't get on Zoom too. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=206.4s)]
*  A lot of people couldn't, frustrated, they couldn't hear anything. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=207.4s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JMJSbhWns&t=209.48000000000002s)]
