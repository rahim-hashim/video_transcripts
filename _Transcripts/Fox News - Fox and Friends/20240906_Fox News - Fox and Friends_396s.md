# Audio revealed of sheriff's office confronting alleged school shooter's dad
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU)
*  And our top story is a Fox News alert at 830 this morning. The teenager accused of murdering two teachers and two students at his Georgia High School is expected to make his first appearance before a judge. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes after his father is arrested and charged in connection with the shooting rampage. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=13.4s)]
*  Brooke Singman has this story. Brooke. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=18.72s)]
*  Yeah guys, the father of the suspected school shooter has been arrested and he's facing charges of his own. This after telling investigators he purchased the gun used in the deadly shooting as a Christmas present for his son in 2023, which was months after the team was flagged for allegedly making an online threat to shoot up his middle school. Georgia officers also spoke to the father when investigating that 2023 threat. Listen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=21.32s)]
*  I'm asking this. Do you have weapons in the house? I do. Are they accessible to him? They are. I mean there's nothing loaded, but they are down. We actually we do a lot of shooting. We do a lot of deer hunting. He shot his first deer this year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=44.68s)]
*  The dad is now charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children. Now these are the most severe charges ever filed against the parent of an alleged school shooter. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=61.56s)]
*  These charges stem from Mr Gray knowingly allowing his son Colt to possess a weapon. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=75.68s)]
*  This is a very difficult time as we know for students and parents and so many I know of students and parents here in this county and around this state are afraid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=84.16s)]
*  And public records show that the suspect's mother has a criminal record dating back to 2007, including charges in connection with aggravated battery criminal trespassing and possessing methamphetamine and fentanyl. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=95.44s)]
*  Four people were killed in the shooting this week, two students and two teachers and nine others were injured. The Georgia Bureau of Investigations announcing that police have made multiple arrests in connection with additional threats made against schools across the state. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=108.32s)]
*  Guys, they are. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=122.16s)]
*  So thank you very much. It's amazing because the mom as question bill as a father's behavior and that's why he's been charged. Mom, obviously a huge drug problem. According to the neighbor. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=123.88s)]
*  She said Lauren Vickers there were nights when the mom would lock him out and his sister out of the house and they would be bang on the back door just screaming mom mom mom and crying. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=133.72s)]
*  It was absolutely devastating. No clean clothes. I'm not exaggerating. It was constant abuse. It was sad. And so this was a time bomb of two children. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  The grandfather said he was just a good kid, but he lived in an environment that was hostile. His dad beat up on him. I mean, I'm not talking about physical but screaming and hollering. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=153.56s)]
*  And he did the same thing to my daughter. And then the aunt said he was begging for help from everybody around him. The adults around him failed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=162.28s)]
*  Surely. And and so the father has been charged in connection with this essentially for supplying the weapon. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=170.28s)]
*  The New York Post has got an exclusive. They say that apparently for Christmas at 2023 that that man bought his son an AR 15. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Here's the thing. After after the cops come to your house and talk to you about your son making perhaps online threats. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=189.28s)]
*  I know they dismissed him. I think a gun is probably not a good thing to buy somebody for Christmas. Nonetheless, we've gotten our hands on a little bit of the sound where the sheriff goes to the house and talks to the father after online threats were made about a school shooting on the Discord app, which is used by a lot of gamers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=198.28s)]
*  This was in May before that Christmas when he allegedly bought his son the gun. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=219.16s)]
*  That's right. So this is after the FBI tipped him off. Sheriff goes in. They had this conversation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do and how to use them and not use them. So it's kind of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=230.0s)]
*  It's kind of a little bit of a shock. So in whatever y'all telling him, please instill in him that what if this is whatever where this is coming from. There's no joke. No, like it's no joke. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=239.6s)]
*  Well, we wouldn't be here. No, I know. I know. And I'm telling you right now. We talk about it quite a bit. All school shootings, things that happen. Yeah. All here. You getting picked on at school. He is. He's getting picked on school and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=251.72s)]
*  Is everything okay? That's why I keep going up there. You know, because you just never, you never really know. And I don't want anything to happen to him. So [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=265.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  He went on to say he's trying to get his son off video games and get out of the house. He said, I want to get him into the outdoors. He's I was so proud of him after he shot his dear yet blood all over him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=274.68s)]
*  But I was so proud of him. It was just a great day. So you could see some traditional struggles that a parent would have with the kid being picked on at school with very few friends. That's a problematic mom with a drug problem in and out of jail. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  And dad wanting to get him out of the house. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a big deal. It's a big deal down south. When you shoot your first year, they put blood on your face. And as dad said, I have a picture on my phone of that day. It's something that dad celebrate with their sons because most people use these guns to go hunting or to protect their families in case someone broke into their house. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  Something that we need to be reminded of. We need to remember these four victims and the 14 year old young boy Mason, a chaplain spoke to the media and said, I was outside of the school and I was trying to comfort his mom because his mom got a message from Mason saying, mom, I'm in the bathroom. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=313.64s)]
*  And so she shows up at the school and she can't find her son. And so she talked to the chaplain and he said, you know, if you he talked to the detectives and the lieutenants and he said, how many times did we do the sweep? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=329.96s)]
*  Do you know that the school is empty for sure? And it turns out that her son apparently was found in the bathroom and he was no longer breathing. And the chaplain said he loved life. He didn't have any issues with anyone. He did have a condition. He was autistic, but that didn't stop his glow. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=339.52s)]
*  And I think the message she would like to have out there is what a great son she had. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=355.4s)]
*  One thing this school apparently had just started doing that week this past week was had essentially a panic button, a button you could press to alert everybody. Hey, there's a problem. They think that that probably saved lives. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=359.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting that the father is being charged in this. We've seen that. We saw that a few months ago in Michigan. Reportedly. But, but, you know, is this the new norm? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=374.44s)]
*  I absolutely love it. This is got it's got to stop. Also a bit later, we'll talk about how JD Vance was tarred with a headline from the Associated Press, which they since corrected, but just goes to show you the media never stops. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKJ1YNXskU&t=382.88s)]
