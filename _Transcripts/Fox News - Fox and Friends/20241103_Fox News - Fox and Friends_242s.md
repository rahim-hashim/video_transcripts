# Former GOP gov says Democrats are 'making a big mistake' on this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q)
*  So one of those major races, they could decide the Senate balance of power, Maryland, where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  a Republican has not won a Senate seat in 44 years, but there's never been a Republican, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  I don't think, in my lifetime, like Governor Larry Hogan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=9.6s)]
*  Our next guest is going to change that, and he is going against Angela, also Brooks, who [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=12.32s)]
*  has a slight lead perhaps in some of the polls, but there hasn't been extensive amount of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=16.56s)]
*  polling. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=20.2s)]
*  Governor, Republican, successful in Maryland. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=21.2s)]
*  Why do you think you could be successful and win like you did the governor's mansion? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=24.84s)]
*  Why do you think you can do it in the Senate? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=28.48s)]
*  Well, Brian, I think we're going to be the biggest surprise upset in the country on Tuesday [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=32.68s)]
*  night and we are out there working hard. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=36.4s)]
*  Look, the voters of Maryland know me and they know after eight years that I'm going to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  a guy that stands up to try to represent all the people of our state, that I'm sort of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  a strong independent leader that is going to do the best job I can representing everyone. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  And we have to put together a winning coalition of not just Republicans and independents, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  but also a pretty big chunk of Democrats. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=58.4s)]
*  And that's what I did two times as governor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=60.12s)]
*  I'm only the second Republican governor reelected in 248 years, so it's hard to do in our state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=62.8s)]
*  But as you point out, we haven't had a Republican senator since 1980, but it's a toss-up race [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=69.04s)]
*  right now and we're feeling really strong. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=74.6s)]
*  So Governor, you consider yourself a conservative, but your state isn't. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=77.0s)]
*  How do you decide when to vote then? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=81.44s)]
*  How to vote then? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=83.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I stand up and try to push the things I can get done. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=84.0s)]
*  I'm the only governor in America to get a Democratic legislature to cut taxes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=88.84s)]
*  And we did it eight years in a row by $4.7 billion. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=92.56s)]
*  We took our economy from 49th out of 50 states to number six, the biggest economic turnaround [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=95.12s)]
*  in America. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=99.96s)]
*  And it turns out, Democrats like that too. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=100.96s)]
*  And I'm back in the blue and getting tough on violent criminals. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm for securing the border. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=108.12s)]
*  And those are things that even Democrats in my state agree with. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=109.88s)]
*  I know you and the president have, the former president, have clashed in the past. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=112.52s)]
*  Where do you agree? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=117.44s)]
*  Well, you know, he did a great job on the economy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=120.44s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=123.24s)]
*  And I think the number one issue in this campaign right now in our state, just like it is in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=124.56s)]
*  the rest of the country, is people are concerned about affordability and inflation, the cost [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=130.74s)]
*  of nearly everything, the cost of housing, the cost of groceries, cost of energy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=134.76s)]
*  And I think, you know, we do agree on a lot of economic policy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  So I just noticed in terms of the stakes, it couldn't be higher. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=143.68s)]
*  Because Republicans, if they get the majority, no one's talking about getting rid of the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=147.16000000000003s)]
*  filibuster. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=149.36s)]
*  No one's going to add two states. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=150.36s)]
*  No one's getting rid of the Electoral College. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=151.36s)]
*  But Democrats are on the record. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=153.44s)]
*  They want to do all three. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=154.96s)]
*  In fact, Senator Ron Wyden, is there any moving on that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=156.4s)]
*  Do you emphasize that on the stump? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=161.8s)]
*  People aren't really talking about that much on the stump, but that's what the Democrats [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=164.12s)]
*  are threatening to do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=167.0s)]
*  And, you know, I think it's really important. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=168.12s)]
*  I'm a guy who believes we need less partisanship rather than more and jamming things through [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=169.68s)]
*  on one vote as opposed to keeping the filibuster where you have to find bipartisan cooperation [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=175.6s)]
*  and reach across the aisle to get things done. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=180.88s)]
*  You know, I'm going to protect the filibuster. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=183.16s)]
*  And I think Democrats are making a big mistake on that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=184.88s)]
*  We shouldn't be able to jam things through on a partisan vote. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=187.92s)]
*  And you consider yourself the model of maybe what Joe Manchin was able to do in the Senate. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=190.44s)]
*  You consider that your template? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=195.88s)]
*  Well, Joe Manchin's a very good friend. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=197.88s)]
*  He and I were working together on a group called No Labels and with the Problem Solvers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=200.88s)]
*  Caucus. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=204.68s)]
*  And Joe actually came out and endorsed me, which I'm proud to have as endorsement in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=205.36s)]
*  our, you know, we're in more than two to one Democratic state and have my next door neighbor, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=208.68s)]
*  Democratic senator, get on board. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  I think it was a big help for our campaign. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=215.28s)]
*  Yeah, he's a great person. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=217.12s)]
*  Governor, best of luck. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=218.44s)]
*  You're trying to buck the odds, but you have the profile to do it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think a lot of Democrats seem very nervous about it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  Governor. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  They're getting nervous. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKy_AC_Uz9Q&t=226.32000000000002s)]
