# Harris scores endorsement for major Latino civil rights organization
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg)
*  Today in Nevada, Kamala Harris continues her battleground blitz as a new poll across swing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=0.0s)]
*  states, including the Silver State, show her neck and neck with Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=10.02s)]
*  But even though Trump has gained ground with Latino voters, he still lags behind Harris [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=14.24s)]
*  as she secures an endorsement from the nation's largest Latino civil rights organization. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=19.32s)]
*  So what does Trump need to do to win over that key electorate in their state? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=25.26s)]
*  Hispanic business owner and Republican candidate for Nevada Assembly, Rafael Arroyo joins us [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=29.98s)]
*  now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=35.660000000000004s)]
*  Rafael, great to have you here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  What does Donald Trump need to do? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=38.92s)]
*  I mean, they're gaining ground. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=40.94s)]
*  It's very clear. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  I've been talking to Latinos across the country and more and more are moving right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  But what does he need to do to overtake Harris, in your view? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  I think he just needs to focus on the policies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what people care about, Latino voters, but all voters in general, is the economy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=53.98s)]
*  They care about inflation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  They care about rising housing costs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=61.0s)]
*  And we've seen in the last four years, you know, that Harris and, well, Biden-Harris [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=62.98s)]
*  administration has really done nothing about it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=67.14s)]
*  So he needs to just focus on the policies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've been saying the same thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=71.38s)]
*  Hispanic Americans see themselves as the working class. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=74.86s)]
*  And that's a big block to be part of. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=78.38s)]
*  And if they continue to speak to Hispanic Americans as the working class about working [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=79.9s)]
*  class issues, I think that's going to work. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=84.54s)]
*  So tell us about this endorsement that Harris got, Kamala Harris got in Nevada. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=87.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, it is a large organization. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=93.26s)]
*  They've never endorsed someone before. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=96.78s)]
*  But to be honest, no one's going to be changing their vote because of this endorsement. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=99.0s)]
*  Like I said, they're going to care about the issues. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=103.54s)]
*  And you know, as a small business owner, I'm the one that has to make payroll every two [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  weeks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=109.7s)]
*  I know where I was four years ago. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=110.7s)]
*  It's way harder than it is, you know, it's way harder right now than it was four years [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=112.3s)]
*  ago. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=116.18s)]
*  And that's what people care about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=117.18s)]
*  They're not going to really care about this endorsement. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=118.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is LULAC, correct? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=119.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=121.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=122.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think Hispanics are paying too much attention to LULAC at all. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=123.38s)]
*  I want you to take a look at this poll. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=127.98s)]
*  This is, or these numbers, this is the number of Hispanics who will be voting in the coming [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=130.38s)]
*  election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=135.58s)]
*  There are 36.2 million eligible Hispanic voters for 2024. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=136.58s)]
*  It's the highest amount ever. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=141.74s)]
*  Latinos are expected to or projected to make up about 14.7% of eligible voters nationally. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  22% of eligible Nevada voters are Latino. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=151.38000000000002s)]
*  That is a huge block. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=155.22000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, the economy is a top issue. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=158.18s)]
*  And also, ironically, the border and illegal immigration is a big topic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=162.98s)]
*  But there are some social issues that Hispanics care about, and there are some very deep contrasts [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=168.26s)]
*  as well, correct? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, you know, I'm out here, I'm running for office for a state assembly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  So I'm out here knocking doors. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=180.26s)]
*  And you know, a couple days ago, I was at a Hispanic voter's door. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=181.94s)]
*  He was from Cuba. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  And he's really concerned about the rhetoric that he's hearing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=186.6s)]
*  He's like, I left this stuff. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=188.94s)]
*  You know, it's the same—you know, he's like, please, let the people know that they [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=190.94000000000003s)]
*  don't ever come through on these promises, you know. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=197.02s)]
*  And I think it's really important for people to look at countries that have tried these [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=200.02s)]
*  types of policies, and even the states and cities that have tried these types of policies, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=202.68s)]
*  to realize this stuff is not working. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  The policies that the president is pushing, President Trump, you know, are going to be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=209.38000000000002s)]
*  the ones that are going to work. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=214.82000000000002s)]
*  Just looking at Venezuela, really easy to vote your way into socialism. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=215.82000000000002s)]
*  It's often bloody to get out of it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=220.18s)]
*  So great having you on, Rafael. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=222.86s)]
*  Thanks for joining us this morning, and good luck on your race. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=225.02s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=228.34s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyMLwxXGSYg&t=229.34s)]
