# BREAKING: China slaps 34% retaliatory tariffs on US
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q)
*  Right now the Dow futures down sharply as global markets take a big hit in response to President Trump's tariffs announcements and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Just moments ago China announced plans to implement 34% [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=7.62s)]
*  retaliate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=12.120000000000001s)]

*  Retaliatory. Thank you tariffs on US goods starting April 10th [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  So senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich is watching all this she's a little seasick and she joins us now Jackie [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=20.88s)]
*  Tell us the latest and you have your own landscaper issues. It sounds like I do I do [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=27.720000000000002s)]
*  You know Brian this market reaction was a shock to everyone really except for President Trump who likened it to a scheduled [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=34.6s)]
*  medical procedure to treat a sick patient I [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=42.88s)]
*  Think it's going very well. It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=47.64s)]
*  It's a big thing I said this would exactly be the way it is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=54.04s)]
*  we have six or seven trillion dollars coming into our country and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=58.32s)]
*  We've never seen anything like it the markets are gonna boom the stock is gonna boom the country is gonna boom [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=63.84s)]
*  And his administration is echoing that line even as the impacts keep coming this morning China announcing retaliatory [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=70.68s)]
*  Tariffs of 34% effective April 10th that by the way is exactly the kind of countermeasure that track Treasury Secretary [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=78.52s)]
*  Said would prompt escalation from the US repeatedly warning against it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=87.24s)]
*  The president's aides maintain the strategy will work and the fallout will be short despite recession warnings from some economists [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=92.8s)]
*  This will be a short time of uncertainty and then we'll move back to the prosperity [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  That this president has envisioned that he is so bold and so willing to fight for and I couldn't be more proud and stand [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=105.84s)]
*  Next to him the new golden age of prosperity will move in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=112.24s)]
*  Now there are some signs that the president's prescription might work [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=116.48s)]
*  General Motors announcing plans to boost production of light-duty trucks in the US announcing that it is hiring several hundred temporary [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=120.24s)]
*  Workers as the auto industry also grapples with sector specific tariffs [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=127.24s)]
*  Renaissance of American manufacturing coming because Donald Trump is bringing him back [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=131.64s)]
*  He's driving them back six trillion dollars. He said today. He's got committed to America. It's unbelievable [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  And other countries are also responding Mexico and Canada both hastening negotiations with the US toward a new USMCA trade deal [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  Eric Trump posting to X [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=153.04s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with Donald Trump [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=154.76s)]
*  The first to negotiate will win the last will absolutely lose. I've seen this movie my entire life [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=160.04s)]
*  meantime Democrats are sounding off about the inflationary impacts of this plan in the house planning to force a vote [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=166.68s)]
*  To try to kill the tariffs entirely guys [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=174.76s)]
*  All right. Thank you so much Brian [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=177.8s)]
*  So this just came across guys so China officially has retaliated [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  You know when you put the fentanyl penalty along with the tariffs out issued yesterday [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  We have tariff China over 50% they have just responded. They don't want to be bullied air quotes [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=189.56s)]
*  They were the 34% tariffs. They also listed 11 American companies of so-called unreliable entities [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=194.84s)]
*  And they're gonna get a halt chicken imports, too [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=202.36s)]
*  Listen we we get a lot more from them than they get from us [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=205.24s)]
*  Yeah, and drone companies which a lot of it's gonna hurt the defense companies [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=209.08s)]
*  A lot of it's gonna hurt the defense industry too because a lot of the parts that we use sadly and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=213.8s)]
*  Astoundingly that our pentagon uses are from parts and materials that we get from china [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=219.54s)]
*  So this is a big wake-up call [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=224.68s)]
*  The other big story is pharmaceuticals are going to be targeted as early as today. Why remember? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=226.36s)]
*  We don't make any drugs here, but yet we use them all so how do you bring manufacturing back? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, if you're in ireland, there's no reason to come here. It's at zero percent [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=235.8s)]
*  But now we're going to start bringing it back as tariffs hit what lastly about china [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=239.4s)]
*  It looks like we're going to tariff third parties that buy venezuelan [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Oil guess who buys venezuelan oil china so they could be hit in in the oil pocket, too [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=248.44s)]
*  Well brian, I mean, I think the the statement that they produce and they're being bullied is comical. They steal products [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  They use slave labor [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=263.32s)]
*  They spy on everything that we do especially if you're a company there [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=265.4s)]
*  You have to turn over all your data to them as well and they use that to build up [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=269.88s)]
*  They're they're funding some of my in of some of our enemies as well [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  So if it's in anything anybody getting bullied, this is united states. We finally got covid as well [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=279.56s)]
*  Good point. Ainsley [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=286.12s)]
*  So what we have now is a president that is taking it seriously and taking it to china [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=287.08s)]
*  Yeah, and bill bill agman who is the billionaire hedge fund guy [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=292.52s)]
*  He said my advice to foreign leaders is that if you have not already reached out to president donald trump [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  You need to do so immediately trump is at his core a deal maker who sees the world as a series of transactions [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=302.84s)]
*  Based on his track record to date with foreign governments law firms and universities. He is a tough but fair negotiator [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=310.44s)]
*  He loves to make deals and he loves to get things done promptly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes promptly [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=321.64s)]
*  I expect trump will reward the early deal makers with fairer deals [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  Than those that wait to sit down at the negotiation table, which sounds just like what eric trump said [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=326.52s)]
*  And and donald trump said every country has called us. That's the beauty of what we do [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=332.12s)]
*  We put ourselves in the driver's seat [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=337.16s)]
*  So I think if you're one of the first few countries that's calling him trying to make a deal [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=338.92s)]
*  That's the one that's going to get all those countries are going to get the headlines [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=342.92s)]
*  And going to say they're working with the united states [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=346.52s)]
*  So I think it would be smart if they were doing this. It looks like they might be behind the scenes [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=348.68s)]
*  So a couple of things, uh, you know yesterday ainsley and I we we know, uh a shirt manufacturer [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=355.16s)]
*  And textiles and he said the one thing that I was showing ainsley the text messages that people should realize [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=361.08s)]
*  Is that we don't really have textile mills that make shirts because it's not a matter of just plugging it in turning on a machine [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=366.68s)]
*  You actually need skilled people to do it. So if you're going to tariff [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=373.32s)]
*  25 let's say coming from vietnam right away [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=377.56s)]
*  They almost become insolvent, especially if you took on debt after the pandemic to keep your company alive [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=380.6s)]
*  So there's so many different elements to it. You could sincerely want to bring your business back [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=386.68s)]
*  But america right now says i'm sorry [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  All we have is vacant warehouses where factories used to be or we were never good at it [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=394.04s)]
*  Ethan lane the senior vice president of government affairs exporters said, uh doesn't love tariffs but understands what trump's doing [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=399.8s)]
*  Nobody who imports or exports likes tariffs us included right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=407.48s)]
*  This is not a tool that we would pick if we had other options [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=411.56s)]
*  But the president makes a very good point that for a very long time [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=414.92s)]
*  We've had the the raw end of a lot of these trade deals, you know in the case of the beef industry [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  we've been used as [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  Uh, you know trade bait or or a bargaining chip in some of these international relationships and it's led to some really lopsided relationships [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  And our hope here is that the president can use this tool to square up the deck and get us a little bit of a better deal [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=432.38s)]
*  With some of these trading partners so that we're not balancing the backs of these different trade balances on on us farmers and ranchers [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=438.94s)]
*  So, you know, we're hopeful this happens quickly and that we can get back to some some low tariff trading with our with our neighbors and our partners [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=445.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think he highlights a point aza that I think [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=452.38s)]
*  You know shouldn't have to be highlighted is they don't want tariffs [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=457.26s)]
*  This is not something that the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=460.22s)]
*  These communities want but they're saying they're getting screwed over and why are we? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=462.54s)]
*  accepting products with no tariff on it and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=468.06s)]
*  The other countries are putting tariffs on our beef and I think that's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=472.06s)]
*  Going to come that's what it's going to come down to all these mom and pops all these local businesses with this the steel [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=475.98s)]
*  The farmers all the other producers they're saying that it needs to be some [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=482.94s)]
*  Some give and take here. Yeah, it needs to be free and fair and that's what that's what donald trump says [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHp4Oo9t6Q&t=487.41999999999996s)]
