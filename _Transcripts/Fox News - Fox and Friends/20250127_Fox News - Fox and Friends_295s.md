# BREAKING: Trump reinstates service members discharged over COVID vaccine
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M)
*  Hi, straight to a Fox News alert. President Donald Trump delivering on yet another campaign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=0.0s)]
*  promise officially reinstating thousands of U.S. service members discharged for not getting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=6.28s)]
*  the COVID vaccine and they get full back pay. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=11.48s)]
*  Madeleine Rivera is in Washington to call the details for us. Hey, Maddie. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=14.68s)]
*  Hi guys. Good morning. The White House says this redress is long overdue, calling them [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=17.88s)]
*  dismissal of military members who refused a COVID vaccine wrongful. Like you mentioned, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=22.36s)]
*  President Biden, this new executive order given exclusively to our Peter Ducey this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=27.28s)]
*  morning directs Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reinstate all members of the military who [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=30.76s)]
*  were discharged for rejecting the COVID vaccine and they will receive full pay and benefits. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=35.88s)]
*  President Trump mentioned this pledge just a week ago in his inauguration speech. The [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=42.22s)]
*  COVID vaccine was required for U.S. military service members for 15 months from August [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=46.36s)]
*  2021 to January 2023. At the time, former Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=51.2s)]
*  the mandate to get the vaccines a readiness issue. 8,400 service members were discharged [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=57.08s)]
*  for not getting the COVID vaccine. In January 2023, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=63.12s)]
*  rescinded the mandate. It was the first time in U.S. history the military reversed a vaccine [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=68.52s)]
*  mandate, but only dozens of those who were discharged chose to return to the military. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=73.8s)]
*  Republicans have argued the mandate hurt the military's recruiting and retention capabilities. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=78.92s)]
*  Last year, Austin touted the military's retention rates and stated nearly all active and reserve [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=83.6s)]
*  components of the military met their recruiting targets for the 2024 fiscal year. But the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=88.52s)]
*  military had acknowledged it had a recruiting crisis just the year before and the mandate [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  was a political headache for the Biden administration, with some troops suing, calling the order [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  illegal. Later this hour, Florida Congressman Brian Mass will be joining Fox and Friends [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  and he will have reaction to this new executive order from President Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much, Maddie. I'm sure Brian Mass is going to be delighted. Donald Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=113.28s)]
*  ran on this. This is just another thing. I don't know if they've got in the West Wing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=118.6s)]
*  somewhere a great big chalkboard or something like that, like last time, where they checked [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=122.6s)]
*  stuff off. Here's something else he promised and one week into his administration, checked [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=127.04s)]
*  that off. The argument was these are military men and women. They're some of our strongest [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=132.44s)]
*  individuals in our country and many of them had natural immunity. So the argument for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=136.54s)]
*  Trump was these were our military. They're willing to sacrifice their lives to fight [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=141.42s)]
*  for our country and we're going to kick out eight thousand of them because they won't [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  get a vaccine. Eight thousand go out. We get this too. Remember the exemption? We're not [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=148.92s)]
*  under the religious exemption on the vaccine. Only the last time when they said when they [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=153.44s)]
*  lifted and said you can come back now without a vaccine, only forty three went back. But [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=157.06s)]
*  now that they say you can go back with full pay, full rank and back pay, I think that's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=161.14s)]
*  excellent. The other thing Lawrence is that people keep the president Biden never talked [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=167.78s)]
*  about recruiting. Austin never talked about recruiting. But until I read the story and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=171.42s)]
*  realized people on the outside go I'm not signing up for that. How many people said [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=176.14s)]
*  I'm not going to even go into recruiting office? I'm not I'm not taking the shot. Brian, it's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=179.78s)]
*  like you read my mind. Just from a logical standpoint, why would you get rid of servicemen [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  and women when we're at a deficit right now when it comes to recruitment? It's like we [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=189.98s)]
*  don't have the room to be getting rid of service member. We should be getting more. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=195.42s)]
*  And it just seems to me that they were such into the Fauci nonsense and some of the stuff [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  that was coming from the FDA and some of the other organizations. There are certain people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  that had national immunity. There are certain people, especially when you're talking about [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=211.66s)]
*  young people that were healthy as well. Talking about service member, I think they could have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=214.38s)]
*  been OK. Some women want to get pregnant. They didn't feel comfortable getting it. And [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=218.66s)]
*  I think that the bottom line is most of the people who decided not to get a vaccine are [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=222.34s)]
*  Republicans and they like Donald Trump. I think it was a political move. Our government [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=225.74s)]
*  was forcing us to put something in our body that some people weren't comfortable with. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=229.54s)]
*  And the main difference is the mandate. Trump said, yeah, I got you a Warp Speed. I got [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  you that. But I wouldn't have mandated the whole country to take it. It resulted in so [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=236.84s)]
*  much resentment. So this only came out five minutes ago. That's when the embargo was lifted. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=240.78s)]
*  It will be interesting to see. Keep in mind, some people have have been out of work or [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=247.26s)]
*  out of that line of work for four or five years. So given the fact that they are going to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  return to their rank with back pay at their normal pace, we don't know if they're going to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  go back wherever they were posted when they were severed from the military. We don't know a lot [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=262.14s)]
*  of this. They should get the money. Absolutely. We just know the headline. They just made [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=266.42s)]
*  thousands of dollars and Donald Trump kept a campaign promise. He said this in the in his [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=270.3s)]
*  speech, the inaugural speech. We were watching it and we everyone that I was watching with said, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=274.7s)]
*  Whoa, that's amazing. Because he said back pay. He promised it back pay. I'm Steve [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IongOogsv3M&t=280.42s)]
