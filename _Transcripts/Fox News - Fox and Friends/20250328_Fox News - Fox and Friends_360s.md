# BREAKING: Trump admin revokes 300+ student visas: 'Lunatics'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8)
*  So you've got all these people coming to the country, taking away scholarships, different [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=0.0s)]
*  activities for Americans, but they're going on these college campuses and they're protesting. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=3.92s)]
*  We see linkages to MAS. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=9.24s)]
*  We see linkages to other foreign governments as well. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=11.28s)]
*  Marco Rubio has made the commitment that he's going to revoke their visa. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  He said that he's already voked 300-plus visas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=19.2s)]
*  Here's the Secretary of State. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=23.76s)]
*  It might be more than 300 at this point. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=24.76s)]
*  We do it every day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=28.46s)]
*  Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=29.62s)]
*  You're saying it could be more than 300. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=31.94s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=33.94s)]
*  I mean, at some point I hope we run out because we've gotten rid of all of them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=34.94s)]
*  But we're looking every day for these lunatics. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=38.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  And so everyone thinks Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  But when Mahmoud Khalil was tossed, the whole, the word came out to these Palestinian organizations [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  linked to a MAS or not, that the Americans are not going to tolerate the campus unrest, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=50.66s)]
*  the takeover of buildings. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=55.78s)]
*  We saw it almost every Ivy League institution outside Princeton. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=57.34s)]
*  Well, I didn't really see much there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=60.7s)]
*  Now not only is the campus is going to lose, the college is going to lose money, but they're [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=62.86000000000001s)]
*  going to lose people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=67.42s)]
*  Now yesterday we found out that we had one person self-deport from Colombia after Khalil [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=68.7s)]
*  was tossed out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=77.26s)]
*  And she sat down in Canada with Al Jazeera to talk about what she thought, why she left. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  Oh, what a great home for her. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=84.9s)]
*  What did she say, Rachel? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=86.86s)]
*  She said the moment Mahmoud got arrested, it sent shockwaves across Colombia's community. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=88.14s)]
*  He is a green card holder. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  That's when I realized I have no rights in this system at all. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  It was only a matter of time before they caught hold of me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=102.5s)]
*  Rachel, this has inspired some disagreement between us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=103.5s)]
*  We normally agree on 90% of these issues, but you're worried about free speech. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=105.96s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=110.22s)]
*  So first of all, I would never be a student in say, Mexico City and go and protest their [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=111.22s)]
*  government. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=115.7s)]
*  I'm just not interested. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=116.7s)]
*  I think that's just rude and you're not being a good guest. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=117.7s)]
*  So I'm with that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=120.06s)]
*  I also don't believe in violence. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=121.06s)]
*  You know, I'm a peacenik. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=122.54s)]
*  I don't think we should have violence and I don't believe in terrorists. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=123.54s)]
*  I don't want anyone here who has ties to Hamas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  That said, I am concerned about free speech. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=131.38s)]
*  I am a free speech absolutist. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=134.34s)]
*  And so I wonder what is the criteria here? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=136.84s)]
*  Should you be able, should we be deporting people who say criticize America and American [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  policies? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=145.5s)]
*  What's the line? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=146.5s)]
*  Or is it only if you criticize Israeli government policy? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=147.5s)]
*  So there are a lot of really good people right now who are very concerned about the chilling [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=151.98s)]
*  effect this could have, not just on these green card holders and these people on visas, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  but what's the message to American citizens about free speech? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=164.77999999999997s)]
*  So that wouldn't worry about American citizens. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's not American citizens. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=170.98s)]
*  These are people on student visas in green card holders. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  I'm just saying the chilling effect. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=175.34s)]
*  If you're seeing people, are they connected to Hamas or are they just criticizing Israeli [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=176.86s)]
*  policy? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=181.78s)]
*  The lawyer I talked to this week, who's representing nine families, says there's direct linkages [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=182.78s)]
*  to Hamas that they posted this group October 6th, get ready for October 7th. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=187.26s)]
*  So there's no doubt about it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  There's organizations here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  There's also, the hostages were saying that the Hamas hostage holders were bragging to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=194.54s)]
*  them about their access to American students. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=199.82s)]
*  The students in America and that they were going to win the power of basically the publicity [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=203.42s)]
*  and the marketing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  They also tossed out somebody in Tufts University, caught this PhD student. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  They also got throughout yesterday at Harvard. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=214.76s)]
*  They threw out a Kassina Petrova, who's a Russian research associate, also with anti-American [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=217.73999999999998s)]
*  activity. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=224.54s)]
*  You're over here, you protest in this country and our allies, goodbye. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=225.54s)]
*  I would just say this, Rachel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  I see your point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=230.06s)]
*  I see how it could be chilling. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=231.22s)]
*  But I want chills to run down the spines of not only terrorists, but people that are residents [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=233.62s)]
*  here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=237.9s)]
*  You're visited here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=238.9s)]
*  You don't have the right, be on your best behavior here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=239.9s)]
*  And what we're dealing with is people that don't love the country, people that have radical [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=243.22s)]
*  ties and I think they're trying to use our laws against us at the time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=247.34s)]
*  So I think what the secretary is, the state is saying, look, I want to find visa violations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=251.82s)]
*  Many of these people have ties to foreign governments. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=256.46000000000004s)]
*  They're trying to have the sense, they're trying to get us to be at each other's necks [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=259.5s)]
*  as well. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=266.46s)]
*  And so you have to send a message to the people that are visitors, don't come in my house [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=267.58s)]
*  and spray paint on my wall. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=272.66s)]
*  And look, we have to deal with the American citizens that are degenerates, we have to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=275.9s)]
*  deal with them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=282.26s)]
*  That is a part of our society. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=283.26s)]
*  We don't have to deal with the visitors that are here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=284.94s)]
*  And I think that's what the secretary of state is doing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=287.66s)]
*  When I was a child in a military brat growing up, I lived overseas almost exclusively. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=290.26000000000005s)]
*  And when we went to the, I attended Department of Defense schools and we had to take a class [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=298.38000000000005s)]
*  called host nation class, where we learned about the host nation and we learned how to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=303.1s)]
*  be a guest, a proper guest in people's country. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=307.42s)]
*  That is my primary concern with this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=311.06s)]
*  And the other concern I have is the thing you touched on, but which needs more attention [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=314.06s)]
*  to, which is the fact that our universities are prioritizing foreign students because [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  they pay full rate tuition. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=322.18s)]
*  And a lot of these slots belong to American kids. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=326.1s)]
*  How many valedictorians aren't getting into these elite schools? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=329.26s)]
*  Because if they're white, exactly, if they're white males, this is something America is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=333.38s)]
*  for Americans. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  And we need to prioritize that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  So I think there's a lot to be said. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=340.78s)]
*  But let's also be careful because we don't want to leave the impression on the world [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=342.54s)]
*  that we are not for free speech. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=348.1s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=349.82s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_pXpNcAs8&t=350.82s)]
