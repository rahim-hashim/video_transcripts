# Kamala Harris called out for 'sexist, misogynist' campaign
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE)
*  Kamala Harris and Tim Walz head out on a bus tour across the state of Georgia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=0.0s)]
*  And despite the latest polling showing that Trump is in the lead by a lot, look at that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=5.8s)]
*  in the state of Georgia, Harris' campaign co-chair says that they think they still have [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=10.08s)]
*  a path to victory in the Peach State. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=13.92s)]
*  We really think that we have a chance to win to Georgia and they're going to compete there [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=17.2s)]
*  in a very hard way. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=20.12s)]
*  And we're going to make Donald Trump defend every ounce of ground in America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=21.12s)]
*  So here to react is Fox News contributor and host of Here's the Deal on Fox Nation, Kellyanne [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=25.04s)]
*  Conway. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=29.64s)]
*  Hey, Kellyanne. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=30.64s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=31.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=32.64s)]
*  I know there are seven important swing states and Donald Trump has to win Georgia and North [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=33.64s)]
*  Carolina. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=37.84s)]
*  The votes can be a combo of the other states if he wins these two. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=39.08s)]
*  Kamala's campaign is saying that they think they have a chance in Georgia and we know [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Kemp and Trump, they're united now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=46.64s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=49.08s)]
*  Do they have a chance? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=50.08s)]
*  Likely not, but we take every vote and every swing state seriously. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=53.44s)]
*  On the our side, this is 16 electoral votes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=57.36s)]
*  President Trump won the state by five points in 2016 and that was followed by two governor's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=60.86s)]
*  races 2018 and 2022, where Brian Kemp, the sitting governor, beat Stacey Abrams despite [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=67.12s)]
*  her very successful effort to register hundreds of thousands of new voters. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=73.52s)]
*  And I think that that helped in 2020 even when she wasn't on the ballot. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=77.7s)]
*  Look, this is very simple. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=80.84s)]
*  Governor Kemp was on Hannity last week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=82.72s)]
*  I don't understand why Kamala Harris just took five days off, I guess a little staycation [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=86.36s)]
*  in between the convention and campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=96.12s)]
*  She just took five days off between Thursday and Tuesday and now she's showing up with [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=98.36s)]
*  Tim Walz in Georgia. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=102.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump and Vance have their own separate schedules. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=104.24s)]
*  Vance will be in Erie, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin on his own. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=106.76s)]
*  That's what you want to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=110.4s)]
*  I want to focus on those 21 counties, a few of which are in Georgia. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  Seven swing states, Ainslie, but 21 counties. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=115.4s)]
*  So in Georgia, they now have voter ID for absentee ballots. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  That's required. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  Georgia does a fantastic job of taking the early vote, having it ready to go and then [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  laying it over the day of vote, calculating and telling us voila who the winner is on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=127.56s)]
*  the actual day. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=132.44s)]
*  I think that's incredibly important. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=133.44s)]
*  This is all about knocking on doors, canvassing, making sure that the voter rolls are clean, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=135.36s)]
*  election integrity. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=141.08s)]
*  I think Brian Kemp and his team have done a great job on that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=142.36s)]
*  And then it's, of course, President Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  He's out there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  He's been going to Georgia. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=148.44000000000003s)]
*  He and J.D. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=149.44s)]
*  Vance are in Georgia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=150.44s)]
*  You have to show up and they are doing the work in the swing states. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=151.44s)]
*  They're giving local print, radio and television interviews. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  Those can last full on a week when you're running for president and vice president. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=158.24s)]
*  People appreciate you touching them close to home. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=161.84s)]
*  Yeah, I saw one of his latest ads where she's saying, oh, prices are so high at the grocery [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=164.52s)]
*  store. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=169.0s)]
*  And then she says, we love Bidenomics. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=170.08s)]
*  It's so successful. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=172.12s)]
*  Then she complains about another price. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=173.12s)]
*  But we love Bidenomics. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=174.92s)]
*  She's flip flopping. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=176.48s)]
*  She's changing her policies, we think, according to her campaign and background. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=177.48s)]
*  But we don't really know what her policies are. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=182.98s)]
*  And now Axios is reporting that there's possibly not enough time for her. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=184.6s)]
*  Her campaign is saying there might not be enough time to release these policies. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=189.08s)]
*  And Donald Trump is saying she's trying to change the debate rules even though they've [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=192.34s)]
*  already agreed. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=195.88s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=196.88s)]
*  Do we have that sound bite of Donald Trump? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=200.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=204.68s)]
*  Keep the same rules. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=205.68s)]
*  Now all of a sudden they want to make a change in the rules because she can't answer questions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=206.68s)]
*  Why doesn't she do a couple of question and why doesn't she do something like I'm doing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=210.92s)]
*  right now? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=215.64s)]
*  She can't talk. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=217.0s)]
*  The truth is they're trying to get out of it because she doesn't want to debate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=218.0s)]
*  How do you interpret it, Kellyanne? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=221.76s)]
*  Well, there's no question that they don't trust Kamala Harris enough to speak regularly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=223.84s)]
*  This is amazing to me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=229.04s)]
*  They're so excited about a woman and the sexist and misogynist that her campaign aren't allowing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=230.04s)]
*  the woman to travel alone or speak on her own, ex-hembraniously, to members of the media. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=234.92s)]
*  Have a town hall. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=240.48s)]
*  Don't be afraid to take questions. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=241.48s)]
*  They can make it as friendly as the pep rally that was the Democratic convention if they [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  want to. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=246.1s)]
*  But freak Kamala already. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  Let her out. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=249.18s)]
*  Let us hear from her. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=250.18s)]
*  And Ainsley, it's—you know, let's get past the laughs and the gaffes and get serious [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  her vision are. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=258.16s)]
*  When she—her vision is when she does promise these policies, that's when she gets truly [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=259.16s)]
*  frightening. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=263.44s)]
*  Sixty-five percent estate and death tax, that's going to decimate family businesses up and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=264.44s)]
*  down this country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  Forty-four percent on capital gains. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=271.0s)]
*  And then the unrealized gains being taxed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=274.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is preparing for dates every single day by doing things like he does yesterday, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  facing the cameras, showing everybody the real people impact at the border of the grocery [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=281.0s)]
*  and gas prices. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=286.12s)]
*  And she's just—she's not doing it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=287.56s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  If you're not practicing those muscles, if you don't have that muscle memory for debates, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  you can't just show up and have people stuff your head with that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=293.24s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't just lose that debate two months ago. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=296.76s)]
*  Donald Trump won it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=298.76s)]
*  And he can do that again against Kamala Harris. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  I hear she's prepping a lot really quickly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=302.0s)]
*  Is Donald Trump prepping? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=303.96s)]
*  He preps every day. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=307.08s)]
*  You see him out there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=308.08s)]
*  He faces the music. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=309.08s)]
*  He's talking about policy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=310.08s)]
*  I think the last 10 days have been remarkable for Trump advance. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=311.08s)]
*  They're out there with these themes in the swing states, talking about policy, crime, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=314.28s)]
*  the border, inflation, economy, foreign policy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=319.36s)]
*  That's the way you prepare. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=321.96s)]
*  He doesn't need the lighting and the camera angles. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=322.96s)]
*  He does policy time with lots of people, but he's been doing this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=325.0s)]
*  And the debates are his sweet spot. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=327.4s)]
*  We know his policies. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=328.8s)]
*  We don't know hers. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=329.8s)]
*  All right, the debate, maybe that's when we'll get some answers. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=330.8s)]
*  Thank you so much, Kellyanne. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVa6xp9nAuE&t=332.71999999999997s)]
