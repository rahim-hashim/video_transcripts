# Dean Cain slams LA wildfires as 'perfect storm' of mismanagement and leadership failure
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA)
*  As fire rages across Los Angeles, our next guest grew up in Los Angeles and watched in horror [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday as his video show, The Street He Grew Up On, burned to the ground and his six previous [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  houses all destroyed. Actor Dean Cain joins us from Nevada. Dean, your reaction to these unfolding [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=10.96s)]
*  events, I imagine you got a lot of them. Yeah, you know, it's stunning to see the devastation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=18.16s)]
*  and what took place. But I call this a perfect storm, Brian. It's a perfect storm of mismanagement [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=25.76s)]
*  and failure of leadership, you know, because the Santa Ana winds aren't new. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=31.92s)]
*  Fires in this part of California is not new. We grew up fighting them and knowing what was going [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=35.68s)]
*  on. What is new is these decades of just absolute terrible leadership, failure to prepare, insane [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=39.6s)]
*  regulations, bureaucracy. It's crazy. And it all came to fruition today, things I've been screaming [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  about for years. And it would finally actually, you know, the taxes, the regulations, these dumb [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=53.84s)]
*  policies finally forced me to move to Nevada. I have so many friends and family that are still [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=59.52s)]
*  there. Fortunately, everybody's OK. So many of my friends have lost their houses, lost everything. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=64.72s)]
*  It's absolutely heartbreaking. Sixty five percent. The fire budget is 65 percent of the homeless [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=72.72s)]
*  budget, which is one point three billion dollars. And they cut by 17 million the fire budget again, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=80.48s)]
*  even though they were recommended not to. Karen Bass wanted a bigger cut. And the city legislature [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  said, no, it can't be that big. She wanted a twenty three million dollar cut. And here is this poor [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  excuse for a mayor who chose Ghana despite the threat of these fires. A trip there. Once she [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=99.84s)]
*  lands, instead of embracing it, trying to tackle it, listen to a Sky News reporter try to get answers [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=106.64s)]
*  from the mayor of Los Angeles. You owe citizens an apology for being absent while their homes were [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=112.64s)]
*  burning. Do you regret cutting the fire department budget by millions of dollars, Madam Mayor? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=119.36s)]
*  Have you nothing to say today? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=127.12s)]
*  You back up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=128.72s)]
*  Dean. Absolutely stunning. That is an elected official. The mayor of Los Angeles cannot [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=131.68s)]
*  answer a direct question in the middle of an absolute emergency. It's insane to me. That's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=140.32s)]
*  the kind of failure of leadership that I'm talking about. It's crazy. And, you know, anybody who could [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=147.6s)]
*  leave L.A. like myself kind of has. I see so many people like I had to get out of there. I had to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=152.88s)]
*  get out of there. And this is this is why the this kind of failure of leadership leads to death [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=158.08s)]
*  and destruction. And it's and things just falling apart. That's what took place here. You know, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=164.08s)]
*  I got to say the firefighters, the first responders, unbelievable, heroic, incredible. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=169.52s)]
*  And the people are such great people and they're used to fighting these things. But you can't do [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  it when all your tools are taken from you. And that's what's happened here. It's just absolute [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  mismanagement. I am so embarrassed to see Karen Bass do that to a reporter, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=183.36s)]
*  just absolutely go quiet like she's in second grade. She should resign immediately. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=188.96s)]
*  She's not equipped for the job. She never was equipped for the job. And the guy of self-made [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=193.68s)]
*  billionaire Caruso, who actually worked to save his property and help others, has been nailing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=198.88s)]
*  it left and right. I wish he had won that as he's a Democrat. I wish he had won that election. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=204.32s)]
*  Dean, I know we're going to talk a lot because you've had this direct experience. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=209.44s)]
*  And thanks so much for getting up early for us. Appreciate it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=213.28s)]
*  Yeah, a pleasure, Brian. Anytime. By the way, Pacific Palisades High School, I played on that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=215.76s)]
*  field a dozen times. Just heartbreaking. They got to rebuild it. Back in a moment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Y8dNmQYcA&t=219.12s)]
