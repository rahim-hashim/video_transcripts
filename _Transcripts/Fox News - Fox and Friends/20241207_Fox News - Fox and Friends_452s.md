# 'OVER THE TOP': House speaker slams Dems' character assassination of Trump picks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA)
*  All right, let's bring in Speaker of the House Mike Johnson who joins us now in Fox and Friends. Good morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. Good to be with y'all. So you heard the report [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=3.72s)]
*  It seems like when it comes to the confirmation of Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  There is a very positive momentum Senator John Cornyn came out last night [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=10.68s)]
*  Expressing his public support for Pete and it seems like things are moving forward with Joni Ernst as well [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=14.76s)]
*  How do you feel as we sit this morning about Pete Hegseth getting confirmed as at DoD? I'm optimistic about it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=20.16s)]
*  I think he's on the right track [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=25.96s)]
*  I talked to a number of senators personally on the Hill just over the last couple of days and seems like the momentum moving the right way [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=27.12s)]
*  Look, I like how he's approached it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=33.2s)]
*  We've all made mistakes in our lives, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=34.96s)]
*  But we believe in redemption and what Pete brings to the table is a love for the military a great [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=36.56s)]
*  Education background a great experience set. I think he's well suited for the job and he will shake up the status quo [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  Which is why this pick is so important. That's what President Trump [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=48.32s)]
*  That's the common denominator people who would shake it up [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=51.08s)]
*  And I think that's precisely why he's getting the pushback that he has I mean the let's face it the me and by the way [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=53.28s)]
*  I love what you said about redemption [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=58.68s)]
*  We've talked about this journey that Pete has been on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=59.84s)]
*  And and his mother talked about it here those of us who sat on the couch have also seen that it's a sincere thing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=62.68s)]
*  He's a family man. He comes here on the weekends. We see it. We know him so well [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=68.76s)]
*  We know who he is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Nobody who have made his made those reports has ever come to us and asked us about it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=75.2s)]
*  But it's so interesting isn't it speaker Johnson that the media and so many of the people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=79.62s)]
*  Who are clutching their pearls over Pete's past or the same people who want to put pornography in our school who are? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  Responsible for basically the degeneration of our culture [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=91.14s)]
*  It's always a double standard with the other side and he's a threat to them because he will shake up the status quo [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=94.1s)]
*  I got here a little bit early this morning [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=99.9s)]
*  I was in the makeup room hair and makeup right these ladies professionals extraordinary staff you have here at Fox News [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=101.86s)]
*  They're back there and they were telling me how much they miss Pete we love him so much. He's so professional [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  He's so great. They showed me there. They're their social media posts where they're defending them [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=112.5s)]
*  These are people have been in work with him for what eight years. He's been a Fox [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=116.74s)]
*  They're his biggest fan. So talk to the people who actually know Pete who worked with us [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=119.86s)]
*  I talked to him a few days ago [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=124.22s)]
*  He was in good spirits and I hope he gets this done. It'll be a good thing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  My oldest son is a freshman at the Naval Academy. This is a live-fire exercise for me [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=128.62s)]
*  We got to fix the DOD and he's the right guy to do it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=132.78s)]
*  You know nobody in Washington spends more of his time than you do recruiting people to run for public office [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  And I would think that things like this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=141.1s)]
*  The treatment of Donald Trump the treatment of Brett Gavina. Make your job a whole lot harder [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=144.38s)]
*  Getting good people who are willing to expose themselves [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=150.06s)]
*  That's exactly right if you want a higher caliber of folks serving in in government and taking on government service [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  This is not a good luck because who wants to subject themselves from this and then the constant [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=159.77999999999997s)]
*  You know barrage on social media and all the things that come with it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=164.24s)]
*  But patriots like Pete are the ones that we need he's willing to take the fire to stand and serve his country, mr [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=167.4s)]
*  Speaker we've seen this process play out almost like dominoes falling you saw it with Matt Gates [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=173.16s)]
*  It moves to Pete Hegseth their talks now that Tulsi Gabbard will be on the hill this week [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=178.24s)]
*  Why should we have any expectation the same treatment won't now be moved to Tulsi Gabbard and perhaps after Tulsi Gabbard Robert F [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=183.24s)]
*  Kennedy jr. Does the president not have a right to his confirmation selections? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  It certainly seems that when Democrats make their selections [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  Republicans go ahead and confirm the Democrats like Joe Biden selections [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  This is a really important tradition and principle that the president a new president gets to choose his or her team [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=200.96s)]
*  And and he has the right to choose the people that he wants to fulfill [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=206.68s)]
*  This mandate that he's been given by the American people and so it's not right for them to go through and and and and do what? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  They're doing this character assassination [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=217.28s)]
*  I think is over the top and it does have a deterring effect of better people getting involved in the system [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=218.88s)]
*  You've got it does you bet it does there's a there's a you talked about all the different cabinet members who are disruptors [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump ran on indicated [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=231.02s)]
*  We kind of pretty much knew that if he won he was gonna put somebody like Robert Kennedy jr. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=233.62s)]
*  And one of the other developments that's been fascinating has been this new agency doge [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  That will be run by Vivek Ram Swami and Elon Musk to look at all the government spending and cut it and what's been interesting [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=244.42s)]
*  Is I actually thought that was even just for PR sake was kind of a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=251.66s)]
*  Bipartisan thing but like the Democrats are actually going we don't really like this agency [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=256.74s)]
*  What is it and it's and they've been calling it a fake agency? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=262.5s)]
*  And and so I want you to listen to what Hakeem Jeffries House minority leader said about it [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=265.84s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on the other side [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=271.42s)]
*  It's unclear to me what exactly the objective is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=274.18s)]
*  related to this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=278.3s)]
*  so-called doge [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=280.06s)]
*  initiative from our perspective [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=282.14000000000004s)]
*  we want a federal government that is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=284.94s)]
*  effective and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  efficient and equitable and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=290.66s)]
*  To the extent the other side of the aisle shares that objective which is what is right for the American people [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=293.94s)]
*  Then we'll see if there's common ground as possible [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=300.78s)]
*  Speaker look up on the wall behind you there. There's some of the government spending the wasteful government spending [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=303.62s)]
*  You know seven billion. We have empty government buildings on this one three million dollars [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=309.9s)]
*  Just think about that three million dollars on girls centered climate action in Brazil [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=314.46s)]
*  Why wouldn't they want to even just from a PR state even if they didn't want to cut their programs just say yeah [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  We're not for that. Yeah, exactly. Look Doge is exciting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=327.46s)]
*  We had Elon of a bake on the hill as you know a couple days ago [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=331.09999999999997s)]
*  And it was it was an amazing time [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=334.62s)]
*  We we brought together I brought together the the Senate and House Republican leaders [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  First the chairs of the committees of jurisdiction the people who do the budgeting and the sort of the infrastructure of government [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=341.46s)]
*  We had a very productive discussion [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  Everybody was really excited about that and then I brought them into the big congressional auditorium and we had I mean almost all the House [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  Republicans and many many of the senators and it was a great dialogue brainstorming session [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  We're putting the groundwork in place to make real transformational change to government [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=361.66s)]
*  We have to make government more efficient and effective it needs to be more focused in what it does [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=366.14s)]
*  Are the Democrats as excited that doesn't look like they're excited. Well, that's how keem's talking points [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=370.66s)]
*  But meanwhile Democrats are joining the team. I mean you heard several Senate [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=376.58s)]
*  Democrats and House Democrats [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=382.14s)]
*  Even on the day that they were on the hill Thursday Friday [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=384.14s)]

*  We all ought to aspire to have a government that is more responsive to the people [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=392.44s)]
*  So we're really really excited about the potential here. We believe we can cut it down even Bernie Sanders [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=396.4s)]
*  Bernie signaled that he was open to this senator Fetterman and Jared Moskowitz in the house and more [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=402.9s)]
*  Look I'm gonna talk to all my Democrat colleagues if you really care about this join us we could do this together [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5napzQQ2DYA&t=409.18s)]
