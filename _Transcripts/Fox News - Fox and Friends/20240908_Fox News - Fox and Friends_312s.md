# The more Kamala Harris speaks, the worse it gets for her campaign: Huckabee
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4)
*  This morning we're just two days away from what will likely be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=0.0s)]
*  The only face-off between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris when they take the debate stage this Tuesday [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=3.64s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about taking on Trump at a presidential debate. He's Trump's surrogate now former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=8.94s)]
*  Thank you for being with us governor. First of all, let's just talk about how weird that is one debate [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=16.44s)]
*  I asked the producers to just just give me some history going back to 2020 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=20.78s)]
*  I mean going back to 2000 always three debates always there was two in 2020 because Trump got COVID [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  And so they cancelled one but that's shocking that there's only gonna be one debate at least for now one debate [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=33.26s)]
*  Well, and the reason for that is because Kamala Harris doesn't want a debate. She doesn't want this one [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=40.6s)]
*  She tried every way in the world to weasel out of it by asking for rules to be changed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=44.9s)]
*  Just so she would have an excuse [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=49.4s)]
*  The fact is the one good thing in all of this is that it's an early debate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=51.28s)]
*  And that's important because some of the debates in the past have happened after half the people had already voted in early voting [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=55.38s)]
*  And so therefore a lot of those folks may have listened to the debate and said oh boy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=62.32s)]
*  Did I ever make a mistake? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=66.86s)]
*  So this time at least the debate is gonna happen prior to people going out to vote. That's a plus [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=68.42s)]
*  Reality is Donald Trump would debate every week if Kamala Harris would want to it's not him that's holding it back [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=75.14s)]
*  It's Kamala Harris and her people they know she can't manage that stage very well with someone like Donald Trump managing that stage [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=81.34s)]
*  It's kind of it's it's the big question of what it's gonna be like on Tuesday [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=88.66000000000001s)]
*  You've been there as we mentioned you've debated Donald Trump and I've said this morning governor [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  Like I think it's not the easiest calculation for Trump either because when you're debating a woman you can come off as a jerk [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  If you're too aggressive, but he has to be aggressive in prosecuting his case and exposing her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  She I think I don't know what she's gonna do because she's got to be substantive at some point in a debate you would think [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=106.92s)]
*  How do you see this plan out on Tuesday? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=113.6s)]
*  Well, I think the smart play for Trump is to do what he did with Biden let Biden talk let Kamala talk the more [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=116.38s)]
*  She talks the worse it gets for her. She does not know how to speak extemporaneously and make sense [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=122.5s)]
*  So all of us have seen her word salad issues. I think if Trump can go in and instead of really [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=127.36s)]
*  Attacking her ask her questions ask her you've been all over the board on fracking. Where are you now? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  You've been all over the board on the border itself [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=139.78s)]
*  You were the borders are explain to us what you did on the border and how well did it work? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  Just go after her with lots of questions because the moderators aren't likely to ask those hard questions of her [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  So Donald Trump can do it and then he doesn't have to be mean about it and let her then talk and if she does that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump walks away with the huge prize and having been on the stage with him one of the things I can tell you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't go in there with this level of being predictable, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=166.84s)]
*  There's a reason that he's running for president right now and I'm talking to you. So there you go [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=171.5s)]
*  Well, you're also you're on Fox friends, but you were also in Israel this week and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=177.5s)]
*  There are there's a lot going on in Israel. There's protests. I believe in Israel asking for a hostage deal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=183.46s)]
*  Anyway [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  Want to ask you what was your takeaway being on the ground this week in Israel? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=191.1s)]
*  My takeaway is and I was there when the six hostages were murdered by being shot in the back of the head [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  Here's the takeaway. There are a lot of stupid people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=202.05999999999997s)]
*  Both in America and around the world who think that Hamas ought to be respected [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=205.5s)]
*  There are a lot of dumb people who think that you can make a deal with Hamas. You can't Israel has put several [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=210.98s)]
*  Offers of a ceasefire on the table Hamas has walked away from every one of them. They don't want to ceasefire [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=216.72s)]
*  They want to let this drag out as long as they can look [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=221.52s)]
*  I understand the frustration of the Israelis many of them just want it to end and there's a hundred and twenty thousand families [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=224.6s)]
*  Displaced they don't have a place to be right now [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=231.44s)]
*  They can't work [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  They can't live in their homes because of rockets coming in from the north and from the south and from the hoodies and from the threat [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=234.48s)]
*  of Iran [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=240.88s)]
*  They want it to be over but they can't have it over until Hamas is destroyed and that there is a real pushback and why this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=241.96s)]
*  Administration doesn't put the screws on Iran stop. The money flow is something that I'll never be able to fully understand [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=249.96s)]
*  Well governor you I don't know when you go back from Israel [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=257.08s)]
*  So I don't know if you're watching Fox and Friends for the last couple of mornings [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=260.2s)]
*  But you know while you were in Israel [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=262.56s)]

*  How pretty it is and and to some extent undiscovered but I had a wedding in Fayetteville last weekend [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=269.08000000000004s)]

*  I think that would be a good reason to show up [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=287.04s)]
*  Well, we wish her more luck than the Razorbacks encountered yesterday when they went west Oklahoma [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5c_97m3-w4&t=289.68s)]
