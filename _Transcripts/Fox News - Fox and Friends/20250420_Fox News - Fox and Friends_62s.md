*  President Trump and Vince Vaughn having a little fun during a recent White House visit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House staff creating this fake movie poster is a humorous nod to the actor's iconic [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=5.0s)]
*  2005 film, Wedding Crashers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=10.36s)]

*  Yes, yes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=25.16s)]
*  It is one of those movies. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=25.68s)]
*  And it applies to everything. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=26.2s)]
*  It does. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=27.2s)]
*  And it's just one of those movies that it doesn't matter if you watched it when it came out or if you watched it yesterday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=27.84s)]

*  Yes, it's such a good point. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=39.24s)]
*  And that comedy, I miss Vince. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=40.36s)]
*  I feel like he hasn't, we haven't had a good comedy in a while. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=41.44s)]
*  But to your point, it always holds up so funny. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And now here he is, man crashing the White House. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=48.28s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  And this also shows that there's that joviality of the White House. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=51.0s)]
*  We've been talking about how a lot of serious things emanate, but the joy is there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIz7tKJIi0M&t=53.68s)]
