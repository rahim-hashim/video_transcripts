# ‘BACK TO BASICS’: Red-state governor pens critical law for prenatal education in school
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw)
*  Idaho Governor Brad Little signing a law [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=0.0s)]
*  requiring students in fifth grade and up [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=3.24s)]
*  to learn how babies develop in the womb. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=5.4s)]
*  Idaho is now the third state [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  to implement this type of curriculum [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=10.14s)]
*  following North Dakota and Tennessee. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=11.72s)]
*  Here to discuss is live action founder [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=14.52s)]
*  and president, Lila Rose. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=16.44s)]
*  Lila, this is so wonderful. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  We've been bombarded over the years with schools, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  you know, teaching kids how to put on condoms [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  and like you're getting back to basics saying, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=26.46s)]
*  hey, this is what a baby is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=28.6s)]
*  Explain your thoughts on it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=31.44s)]
*  Yes, so we're thrilled over here at Live Action [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=34.92s)]
*  about this new baby Olivia law [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=36.92s)]
*  that has been passed in Idaho. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=39.32s)]
*  Big shout out, obviously, to Governor Little [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=40.74s)]
*  and also to Senator Tammy Nichols [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=42.84s)]
*  who made this law possible. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=44.88s)]
*  But here's the deal. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  The Planned Parenthood has had this choke hold [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=48.08s)]
*  on schools and curriculum in our schools [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  for really decades now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=53.38s)]
*  And they're this big abortion chain [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=54.8s)]
*  who is lying about the development of the baby in the womb, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=56.52s)]
*  about the value of life. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=59.56s)]
*  And so what this really is a science-based, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=60.64s)]
*  lifelike content that shows the development of the baby [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  from the moment of fertilization until birth [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=67.68s)]
*  with all the amazing markers, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=69.7s)]
*  about the heart beating at just three and a half weeks, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=71.44s)]
*  about the nervous system developing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=74.0s)]
*  I mean, it's really incredible [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=76.56s)]
*  to look at the development of a baby. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=77.92s)]
*  And this is what students deserve. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=79.64s)]
*  So I'm thrilled that this is now going to be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=81.14s)]
*  the opportunity for students to see this in Idaho. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=84.2s)]
*  And we're looking at 19 states, I hear, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=87.16s)]
*  are considering similar legislation this year. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=89.28s)]
*  So this is a new movement in this country [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=91.6s)]
*  to celebrate life and embrace the scientific truth [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=93.36s)]
*  of the value of human life. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is the right way to teach sex education, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=97.2s)]
*  by the way, in school. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=99.72s)]
*  And you guys pioneered this with Baby Olivia. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=101.0s)]
*  If those who are watching have not been onto [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=103.08s)]
*  Lila Rose's website and seen the Baby Olivia video, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=105.88s)]
*  it's beautiful. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=109.32s)]
*  And it's what women are now seeing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=110.8s)]
*  when they go get their 4D ultrasounds, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=112.52s)]
*  which we know has been a real, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=114.2s)]
*  just sort of game changer in terms of the pro-life movement, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  because once people know it's really a human, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=120.88s)]
*  they can dispense with all the lies told by the left [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=123.8s)]
*  in the abortion lobby and afford it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=127.16s)]
*  the respect that it deserves. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=129.72s)]
*  I wanna move to a second topic, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=131.82s)]
*  which is the Colorado State Lawmaker. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=133.42s)]
*  So there was a bill for state funded abortion, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=136.0s)]
*  and this Colorado Lawmaker said this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=140.28s)]
*  We don't have the video, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=143.52s)]
*  but I'm gonna give you the quote of what she said. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=144.36s)]
*  She said, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=146.04s)]
*  "'A birth is more expensive than an abortion.' [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=146.86s)]
*  So the savings comes in Medicaid births [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=150.08s)]
*  that will not occur. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=152.8s)]
*  The savings from averted births outweigh the cost [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=154.44s)]
*  of covering reproductive health care for all Coloradans.' [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=157.36s)]
*  And you can imagine, Lila, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=161.0s)]
*  that that's all the more her case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=162.82s)]
*  If you have a child like mine who has Down syndrome [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=165.54s)]
*  or has some medical issues, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=168.4s)]
*  this is eugenics, isn't it? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  This is a sick eugenic policy, Rachel, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  that it's really shocking to look at [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  because it's basically saying it's immoral, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=178.08s)]
*  first of all, to kill babies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=179.96s)]
*  I mean, that's wrong, but this is saying, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  hey, children are not worth it, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=183.52s)]
*  so let's support ending the lives of children, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=184.9s)]
*  ending pregnancies in Colorado, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=187.24s)]
*  instead of helping mothers and families [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=188.84s)]
*  with their children, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=191.12s)]
*  which should be the focus of public policy [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=191.96s)]
*  that's pro-family, not anti-family. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=193.8s)]
*  And listen, we're facing a zero, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=195.96s)]
*  we're facing a population crisis. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  Zero percent growth in population. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=200.4s)]
*  And so it's absolutely crazy that instead of focusing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  on supporting families, build their families, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  they're focusing on helping families destroy their families, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  which is gonna lead to extinction in this country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  We can't replace ourselves with a population. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=215.52s)]
*  The population collapses. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=217.08s)]
*  That's actually going to lead to tremendous [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=218.46s)]
*  social and economic problems. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=220.24s)]
*  So it's not only this horrible pro-abortion policy, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=221.56s)]
*  it's extremely short-sighted to try to, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  it's ultimately gonna destroy the future [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=227.56s)]
*  of Coloradans and of Americans. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=229.12s)]
*  So again, this is what happens [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=230.72s)]
*  when the pro-abortion brain rot sets in, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  where you see children as threats and not blessings, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=234.6s)]
*  their burdens not blessings, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  when the reality is our whole future depends [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=238.36s)]
*  on welcoming new lives into the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=240.72s)]
*  Yeah, no question about it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=243.36s)]
*  Sometimes I'm grateful when these lawmakers, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=246.24s)]
*  these pro-abortion lawmakers actually say the truth, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=249.36s)]
*  because we know that Planned Parenthood started [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=253.32s)]
*  on this entire idea of eugenics, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=255.32s)]
*  of blacks and Hispanics, Catholics, disabled. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=257.76s)]
*  And sometimes, and she's not the only one, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=261.08s)]
*  AOC has been on record saying this type of stuff, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=263.68s)]
*  and so has Congressman Porter out of California [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  in an interview saying the way to deal with inflation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=270.84s)]
*  is abortion. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=274.0s)]
*  And so sometimes they say what they really think, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=274.84s)]
*  and it's also useful for us to hear that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=277.2s)]
*  Lila, you're always on top of it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=279.56s)]
*  Again, I encourage everyone to share [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=281.36s)]
*  with your own children, your family, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=283.56s)]
*  the Baby Olivia video, it's really beautiful. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=285.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=288.2s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=289.32s)]
*  And we're excited to defund Planned Parenthood right now, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  because this is the group pushing all this nonsense [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=292.48s)]
*  in schools, pushing abortion, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=294.88s)]
*  pushing the trans agenda towards young children, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  and it's time to defund them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZQCjG4dVFw&t=299.44s)]
