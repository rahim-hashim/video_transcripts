# Michigan graduate rips commencement protesters: These people hate America
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y)
*  happened at Michigan was right in front of our next guest at yesterday's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  graduation at the University of Michigan. Benny Schafsky joins us now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  So Benny, tell us about what's going on in Michigan and how, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  tell us also what you think the greater sense of the university is, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=10.68s)]
*  the students towards everything taking place. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=13.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I apologize for my rough voice. It was, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=16.0s)]
*  comes from yelling at these protesters during my graduation ceremony that was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=19.44s)]
*  interrupted. So I apologize for that, but thank you for having me on this morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=22.52s)]
*  I wanted to clarify your prior report. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=27.12s)]
*  The protesters were not removed from the disruption from the event rather, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=29.48s)]
*  and they remained for the entire duration of the event causing a massive [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=33.6s)]
*  disruption. It was not a brief disruption. In fact, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=37.0s)]
*  I was seated about five rows in front of them for the vast majority of the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=40.0s)]
*  commencement ceremony. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=44.32s)]
*  They began disrupting when the secretary of the Navy decided to speak. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=45.24s)]
*  I got up on stage and then a banner overhead flu that said free Palestine, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  divest from Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=53.88s)]
*  These protesters about a hundred in number decided that they wanted to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  interrupt the commencement ceremony for 8,000 graduates and their families. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=60.0s)]
*  I've been a lifelong Michigan fan. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=64.28s)]
*  I've been a supporter of the university for my entire four years and really it's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  my dream school. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=69.64s)]
*  And to have this happen to me in the most important day of my four years is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=70.4s)]
*  really troubling. And I'm just really speechless with what happened. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=74.72s)]
*  Benny, I'm just, I'm, I'm looking at you. And all of a sudden you look familiar. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Were you also part of a viral video this week where you confronted a pro [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian processor at the university of Michigan? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=89.2s)]
*  I was, I was there have been, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  there's been a large encampment on our campus for about two weeks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  It continues to grow in size and the university administration has done [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=97.56s)]
*  nothing to remove it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  They've had banners displayed that say long live the Intifada calling for a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=102.04s)]
*  violent genocide against my people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  They want to systematically eliminated. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=108.72s)]
*  And frankly, I'm not willing to stand for that on my campus. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=110.92s)]
*  So I took it upon myself to remove these genocidal posters that are displayed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=113.92s)]
*  against school policy on university buildings. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=118.44s)]
*  I removed one of these from a school building and the anti-Israel agitator [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=121.4s)]
*  decided to confront me and try to figure out why I was doing this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=125.68s)]
*  Don't think it went terribly well for her considering how viral the video is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=129.68s)]
*  gone, but I think it shows that these people just hate America. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=132.88s)]
*  They want to destroy our values and they don't believe in the free speech of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  everybody. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=139.6s)]
*  Yeah, Benny, I think, you know, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  these kinds of protests disrupting something like a graduation have the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=141.32s)]
*  counter impact on everybody else there. They look at that and they go, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=144.32s)]
*  you're, you're, you're ruining it. This is why we can't have nice things. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=147.28s)]
*  You can go protest somewhere else. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  So the university allowed them to stay the entire graduation. I mean, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=153.12s)]
*  were they making noise the whole time? I mean, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=157.04s)]
*  that would be disruptive throughout. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=161.64s)]
*  The university made it clear at the beginning several weeks before the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=162.28s)]
*  commencement started that no flags, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=165.36s)]
*  no banners would be permitted inside the stadium for this exact reason. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  Yet a hundred of these individuals got up with their Palestinian flags, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  with their anti-Israel banners and gathered in a large group and started [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=174.8s)]
*  chanting from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=179.24s)]
*  Long live the Intifada calling for these violent uprisings against the Jewish [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  people. And yet the university did not enforce their protocol. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  I spoke to university officials at the event. I spoke to police and they confirm [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  that they were violating these rules, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=194.2s)]
*  yet they did not take the action that was necessary to remove them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=195.76s)]
*  The only way that I was able to listen to have the remaining half of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=199.32s)]
*  commencement was by having an usher move me and my friends. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=202.04s)]
*  But that didn't help the other people that were seated around the protesters. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=205.2s)]
*  And I just don't understand why the university and president Santa Ono isn't [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  taking the action necessary to remove these anti-American, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  anti-Israel individuals from the commencement and the broader university. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=215.84s)]
*  You know, Benny, I know it was a big day for you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=219.96s)]
*  It was also a big day for your parents. Were they there as well? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  Your parents were there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  As you guys have sort of processed what happened yesterday, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=227.24s)]
*  and by the way, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=229.68s)]
*  I'm a parent who went to a graduation ceremony like this at a big university. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=229.96s)]
*  And I would just be so angry as a parent. I paid, I paid for that event. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  I paid to be there after so many years of paying and supporting my [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  daughter. I would be furious. Tell me what your parents' reaction is. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  And also if they have any regrets, I mean, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=248.4s)]
*  I attended a summer at the university of Michigan. It's famously liberal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=250.2s)]
*  And so are there any regrets that they have about really [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=254.72s)]
*  in some way, whether they acknowledged it when they did it or not, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=259.76s)]
*  we're all supporting, you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=263.84s)]
*  you're supporting with your financial dollars and institution that did exactly [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  what you described, did nothing, in fact enabled people who have no respect [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=269.4s)]
*  for just being civil. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=274.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=276.52s)]
*  My family has been supporters of the university of Michigan for my entire life. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=278.48s)]
*  My parents went to the university of Michigan. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=281.92s)]
*  My grandparents went to the university of Michigan. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=283.48s)]
*  We love the university of Michigan and it's become a university that we, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=285.76s)]
*  frankly, we no longer recognize. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=289.08s)]
*  This was our fear for months that this was going to happen and yet it happened [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=291.08s)]
*  and nobody did anything about it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=294.68s)]
*  So I think we're questioning our support for the university moving forward. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=296.08s)]
*  Well, Vinny, we all have to, we all have to, that's the hard part. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=299.88s)]
*  We all love our alma mater and we have those connections, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=302.68s)]
*  but if it's turned into a little Marxist camp where they're allowing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=304.96s)]
*  revolutionaries to do whatever they want, it's time to reconsider. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=307.48s)]
*  But Benny, all of that aside, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=311.12s)]
*  you deserve a graduation in peace to be congratulated for an accomplishment. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=313.32s)]
*  We're proud of you too. We're proud of you too. Congratulations. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=317.76s)]
*  I wish you had lost your voice from partying instead of yelling at protesters, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=322.0s)]
*  but we're proud of you and we hope that somehow, you know, can I just say this? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  A lot of these kids that are graduating also, you know, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  didn't get a graduation for high school and have a lot of other things disrupted [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=334.04s)]
*  because of COVID and that tyranny. So Benny, congratulations. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=337.2s)]
*  Sorry that happened. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=341.8s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-oie_0B4-Y&t=342.8s)]
