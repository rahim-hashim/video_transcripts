# Israel thwarts alleged Netanyahu assassination plot linked to Iran
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4)
*  Fox News alert an assassination plot against Israeli Prime Minister Ben Menyahu as well as Defense Secretaries foiled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=0.0s)]
*  Foiled I'm sorry earlier this morning an Israeli man allegedly recruited by the Iran was charged with this incident [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=6.88s)]
*  Meanwhile fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies after a series of sabotage attacks in Lebanon [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Mike Tobin is live in Tel Aviv Mike my wife and I were talking about this situation [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=19.96s)]
*  what [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=25.68s)]
*  Presumably the Israelis did with these [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=27.04s)]
*  beepers and the walkie talkies and everything and my wife said you know if you saw it in a movie you wouldn't believe it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=30.0s)]
*  But believe it because it happened [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=37.04s)]
*  It certainly is remarkable and it shook things up out here and it was very dramatic [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=40.72s)]
*  I will going all the way down to establishing apparently a bogus company [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Just for the production of these exploding pagers and you had to have people in the sales network [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=48.2s)]
*  People have people making shrimp rack shrink-wrap just to make it look believable [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=53.56s)]
*  But as far as the conflict goes Hezbollah has been promising retaliation [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=57.92s)]
*  And we've seen some rocket fire come over the northern border some drone fire as well [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=62.28s)]
*  Resulting in some injuries on the Israeli side [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=67.16s)]
*  But it seems that Israel has been much more aggressive in terms of being offensive this morning [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=69.98s)]
*  Israel struck at several targets in southern Lebanon including what the IDF is describing as a weapon storage facility [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=74.76s)]
*  And that follows that two-day flurry of violent espionage with sabotage electronics [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=81.94000000000001s)]
*  Pagers walkie talkies and solar equipment all exploding the Lebanese health minister just a short time ago said in the explosions yesterday some 25 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=86.22s)]
*  People were killed six hundred eight injured so that brings the total from the electronic sabotage to thirty seven dead more than three thousand injured [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  It's very impressive [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=104.14000000000001s)]
*  But the the the groundwork to develop the assets the sources you know the recruited agents that can get you to that point [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=105.66s)]
*  Is is amazing now we've been watching their their redeployment of forces from down south up north [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=114.06s)]
*  And I think they've been laying the groundwork here for a major offensive [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  I don't think they see any other option at this stage of the game [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=125.1s)]
*  Another dramatic development treason and Israeli businessman has been indicted and accused of working with Iran [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=129.9s)]
*  In an assassination plot against top Israeli officials 73 old Mahdi Mamen had been living in Turkey [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=135.2s)]
*  That's where he allegedly came in contact with Iranian businessmen in April of 2024 [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=141.12s)]
*  He was offered various tasks by Iranian operatives including photographing crowded locations [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=145.84s)]
*  Ultimately assassination plots for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Defense Minister Yoav Galant and Shin Bet intelligence chief Ronan bar [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=151.0s)]
*  Mamans lawyer said he made an error in judgment and he's cooperating with Israeli authorities guys back to you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz6JEgpcC_4&t=158.56s)]
