# Major protests erupt in West Bank
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8)
*  This is a Fox News alert right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=0.0s)]
*  Fires are burning in the West Bank as [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=2.52s)]
*  more major protests are now erupting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=4.84s)]
*  in that area. Alright, let's go [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=6.72s)]
*  out to Jonathan Hunt, who's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=8.52s)]
*  live in Ramallah, Jonathan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=9.8s)]
*  Good morning again to you guys. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=13.4s)]
*  Hundreds of impassioned protesters [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=15.32s)]
*  on their way here now following [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=16.76s)]
*  Friday prayers we were among them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=18.76s)]
*  Early are in the center of Ramallah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=20.6s)]
*  They are now moving here to the edge [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=22.76s)]
*  of Ramallah and as I step out of the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=25.0s)]
*  front here we can show you that the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=27.56s)]
*  initial protests have set fires [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=30.16s)]
*  down in front of us there. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Those are tires, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=33.6s)]
*  which is one thing they frequently [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=34.6s)]
*  do just to send the smoke up. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=36.48s)]
*  It obscures the view if you like from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=38.6s)]
*  what you look a little further to the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=40.96s)]
*  right there those buildings directly [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=43.36s)]
*  in front of us. That is the IDF [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  headquarters here are right behind that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=47.68s)]
*  In fact, is one of the Jewish settlements [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=49.96s)]
*  that it sits on the edge of Ramallah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=52.56s)]
*  Now what we expect the protests [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=55.32s)]
*  protesters to do and as I say, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=57.32s)]
*  there are hundreds of them on their way [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=59.44s)]
*  here to come down near to where you are [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=61.8s)]
*  looking at that those fires burning and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=64.56s)]
*  then traditionally what they do is gather [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=66.92s)]
*  right in front of us here and they begin [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=69.2s)]
*  throwing stones up towards any soldiers [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  they see coming from that base or outside [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=74.08s)]
*  the base now passions always run high [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=76.76s)]
*  here after Friday prayers, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=79.2s)]
*  but in the wake of what has happened [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=80.64s)]
*  since October 7th and the Israeli [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=83.28s)]
*  reaction in Gaza, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=85.48s)]
*  Palestinians that we have spoken to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=86.76s)]
*  here are frankly furious and even if [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  you put to them the barbarity, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=91.12s)]
*  their horrific nature of the attacks [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=93.16s)]
*  on October 7th by Hamas, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=95.36s)]
*  they say yes, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=97.12s)]
*  civilians perhaps shouldn't have been killed, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=98.04s)]
*  but they believe a lot of Palestinians [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  here in the West Bank believe that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=102.76s)]
*  overall Hamas is fight is justified. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=105.2s)]
*  And in fact, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=107.44s)]
*  we've been speaking to politically [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=108.48s)]
*  connected people here who say that they [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=110.48s)]
*  a lot of Palestinians are running out [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  of options with the more moderate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=115.12s)]
*  Palestinian Authority that governs here [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=117.08s)]
*  in Ramallah and the rest of the West Bank. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=118.92s)]
*  And if there was an election held now, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=121.56s)]
*  they actually believe that Hamas would win it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  Just imagine how frightening a prospect [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=126.56s)]
*  that is for anyone in Israel. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=128.4s)]
*  We're also being told by people who [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  know the situation on the ground here [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=132.24s)]
*  that Islamic Jihad is gaining strength too. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=134.36s)]
*  That's further to the northern part [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=136.68s)]
*  of the West Bank around cities like Janine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=138.6s)]
*  But clearly this is a tinderbox [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  in the West Bank right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=143.96s)]
*  Just last night, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=145.12s)]
*  nine Palestinians were killed in clashes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=146.12s)]
*  with the IDF that brings depending [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=148.6s)]
*  on which figures you go by anywhere [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=150.8s)]
*  from 100 to about 140 Palestinians killed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=152.68s)]
*  here in the West Bank since October 7th. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=156.44s)]
*  And we're waiting now for what is likely [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=158.72s)]
*  to be another passionate, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=160.12s)]
*  possibly violent protest here guys. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=161.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=164.24s)]
*  It's only two o'clock in the afternoon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's see what happens next. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you very much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsEQBPeAmP8&t=168.12s)]
