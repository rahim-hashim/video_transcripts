# Trump addresses Comey's '86 47' message: 'He knew exactly what it meant'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE)
*  All right, okay this story it's sparking a wave of anger James Comey our former FBI director [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=0.0s)]
*  Posted on Instagram something that many aren't many are interpreting as a call for violence on the president [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=6.36s)]
*  Look at this the caption reads cool shell formation on my beach walk and it says [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=12.16s)]
*  8647 so this is what the former director is saying in response to this it literally makes no sense [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=20.12s)]
*  But here it is I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assume [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=25.54s)]
*  Were a political message. I didn't realize some folks associated those numbers with violence. It's never occurred to me [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=33.58s)]
*  But I opposed violence of any kind so I took the post down [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=40.78s)]
*  So what political message is you think it represented just in case you don't know most people do in the dictionary it? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=44.3s)]
*  86 a slang for to throw out to get rid of and to refuse service to a lot of restaurants use this when I was a waitress [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=50.38s)]
*  They would put 86 green beans on the chalkboard so knew we were out of it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  But when it comes to law enforcement 86 means death that's my 86 time [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=61.46s)]
*  He's dead so we thought the head of the FBI has to know what 86 can be used [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=66.22s)]
*  Why would you post that number one who cares what James Comey thinks all he spends his time on the beach? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=70.66s)]
*  I'm wondering did he do that rock for me? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=75.06s)]
*  To just walk down and thought you'd share it so this cause this cause Don Jr. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  Stumbled on at first and said are you calling for the assassination of my dad? Yeah, so here's the president asked [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=82.7s)]
*  Responding to it. He knew exactly what that meant a child knows what that meant if you're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=88.94s)]
*  the FBI director, and you don't know what that meant that meant [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=94.58s)]
*  assassination and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=99.42s)]
*  It says it loud and clear [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  Now he wasn't very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  He did it for a reason and he was hit so hard [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  Because people like me and they like what's happening with our country our country has become respected again and all this and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=114.62s)]
*  He's calling for the assassination of the president obviously he apologized and said he doesn't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=120.9s)]
*  Violence, but look he's a very what do you want to see happen? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  What do you want to see happen? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to take a position on it because that's gonna be up to Pam and all of the great people [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=130.06s)]
*  But I will say this I think it's a terrible thing and when you add his history to that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  If he had a clean history he doesn't he's a dirty cop [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  He's a dirty cop and if he had a clean history I could I could understand if there was a leniency [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=145.22s)]
*  But I'm gonna let them make that decision [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=153.22s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard was asked do you believe that Comey should be in jail? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=156.18s)]
*  She said I do any other person with a position of the truth that has people who take them very seriously with a guy of that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=159.14s)]
*  Stature his experience and with propaganda media has built up him the up-to-date [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=165.5s)]
*  She's very concerned so Secret Service is now dispatched to investigate and Don jr. Said just James Comey casually calling for my dad to be murdered [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=170.02s)]
*  This is who the dumb media worships demented [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=177.94s)]
*  We've already had two attempted assassination attempts on the on the president [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=181.42s)]
*  Why would you encourage that why would you put that out there and playing stupid? It's not gonna get you anywhere [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=185.42s)]
*  I look forward to the investigation. I'm Steve juicy [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sqJKn8-QYE&t=190.01999999999998s)]
