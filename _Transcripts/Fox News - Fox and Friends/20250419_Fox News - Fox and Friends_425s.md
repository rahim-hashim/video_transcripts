# Perino: Harris did ‘generational damage’ to the Democratic Party
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y)
*  All right, well Democrats floating AOC as a possible contender for the 2028 election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  But Kamala Harris is looking to get back into the game [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=5.92s)]
*  Believe it or not the former vice president is planning to headline a DNC fundraiser with tickets starting at [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=9.84s)]
*  $25,000 meanwhile a DNC official is fakey facing backlash over plans to spend big to replace certain House Democrats [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=17.0s)]
*  He is an officer of the Democratic National Committee. I think am I look it up and talk to lights [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=25.04s)]
*  He has a fiduciary duty and so he's had a fiduciary duty to the Democratic Party and he's gonna raise 20 million dollars in primary [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=30.96s)]
*  Democrats does he really think the problem that we're facing in United States [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=38.88s)]
*  Today is because of we got 65 year old Democrats in office as big but why don't you take on the Republican? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=43.68s)]
*  That's your job. Well, it's the most insane thing up honestly [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=50.6s)]
*  Just do a slight rant here the most insane thing I ever heard is the bike chair the Democratic National Committee [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  It's been a 20 billion dollars run against other Democrats [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=60.52s)]
*  Well America's newsroom co-anchor and co-host of the five Dana Perino joins us now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=64.16s)]
*  So Dana we sort of heard you you were commenting while he was talking. What are your thoughts on this? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  I have a problem of doing that. I'm like, yeah, well, I think so James Carville is right [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean here you have this very young progressive guy that they gave an official position to at the DNC and his state [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=77.18s)]
*  Admission that he's very proud of is saying I am going to take out all the moderate Democrats and all the older people who have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=83.34s)]
*  Established themselves so that we could put progressives in so that we can lose even worse next time [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=89.98s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense and then Kamala Harris. I sort of if I were a donor I'd say how dare you ma'am [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=94.72s)]
*  I think you should give me back all the money that I gave to you guys because of the cover-up [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=100.5s)]
*  You guys told us to give you money because Joe Biden was going to be the best president [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=106.38s)]
*  He was the one who's going to protect the country from this existential threat that was President Trump and they did [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=111.9s)]
*  Generational damage to the Democratic Party and I don't think she can ever recover from that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=116.58s)]
*  She might be able to try to run for governor [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=121.6s)]
*  They are so much worried about running against Trump now. He's not going to be on the ballot next time [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=123.62s)]
*  So they have to they got to find somebody new [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=129.42s)]
*  I actually don't think it's going to be any of the people that we were just talking about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=131.42s)]
*  I think it will be somebody different something that Doug Sosnick calls an outside politician [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=135.62s)]
*  Someone who's not senator van Hollen [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  It goes to El Salvador someone who stays into the Senate and does all it will be somebody who has to actually do things [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  Out in the country. So either some of them from the private sector, but more likely a governor [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=148.9s)]
*  It's not AOC in your book. It is not AOC, but I admire her at least she's out there trying [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=152.1s)]
*  I mean Bernie Sanders is their biggest draw right now. He's older than Biden. So in four years, what are they thinking? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=157.34s)]
*  That's going to be I do admire her [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  She's got a special something [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=165.7s)]
*  But it's not something that I think is going to unite the country and she's not going to be president [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=167.1s)]
*  But she can raise a lot of money socialism is not uniting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=171.66s)]
*  It's forced unity. Yes [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=176.1s)]
*  About the difference between AOC who you know says like fight fight the party and bring the new progressives and David Hogg who was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=179.78s)]
*  Called a contemptible little twerp by David Carl. They're like you could argue from the outside [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=186.74s)]
*  She grew a carver for once [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=190.78s)]
*  I actually think that they have a similar problem. So Bernie and AOC are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=193.7s)]
*  pushing forward this progressive move [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=199.14s)]
*  Which the country just decided decisively said we're not interested in so there's all the energy in the party is over there [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=201.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, you have senator van Hollen who is trying to like [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=208.9s)]
*  Gain in stature in the absolute wrong way and Cory Booker willing to follow it into footsteps [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=212.78s)]
*  So you are out with a new book I am I wish someone had told me and I love this because this is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  One in a series of books you've done where you know, there's so many bad influences that kids get today and you always [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  Bring the good influence a lot of green by the way. I know I've gone green [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=233.33999999999997s)]
*  Environmental this book is a good companion to the previous one that one was called everything will be okay [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=241.94s)]
*  Life lessons for young women from a former young woman [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=246.62s)]
*  And it was very much targeted to young women ever young [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  This is not this is something that is for men women and it's also not just for the graduate [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  Although I think it's perfect for graduates [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=257.66s)]
*  It's for those mentees that I had ten years ago who are now becoming parents taking on the executive roles [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=259.5s)]
*  Managing people and thinking beyond themselves like what's bigger and brighter? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=266.62s)]
*  Outside of work. So give me one thing. I wish somebody had told me [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  From me. Yeah, I [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=276.06s)]
*  Wish somebody had told me to stop worrying so much in my 20s. Your 20s are so important [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=278.38s)]
*  That's when you have to work really hard so that you can have a better work-life balance in the future [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=284.38s)]
*  But I was so worried about how it was all going to turn out and when I look back everything that I planned [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=287.7s)]
*  Didn't happen anyway because God's in charge. So if I had stopped worrying in my 20s, I would have enjoyed them more [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=294.14s)]
*  I still would have worked hard [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=300.7s)]
*  But why was I worrying all the time and I wish someone had told me actually people did tell me you wish you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  I wish I had listened [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=306.94s)]
*  And there's so many contributors I mean you like you and that yeah, you got advice of jerks Bentley, Brett [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=311.42s)]

*  Continue to mentor and I don't have children [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=323.62s)]
*  So so for the young mothers that I are still in my little world [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=325.82s)]
*  They would ask me questions like I don't have all the answers so I asked Martha McCallum and Lydia who I asked people about career [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=329.58s)]
*  transitions like what's it like to try to go from being a lawyer to go into journalism or [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=337.14s)]
*  From print into broadcast for dirks Bentley [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=341.7s)]
*  I asked him a lot about what is it like to deal with rejection and how do you overcome that and keep trying and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=344.58s)]
*  It's interesting because people can get crushed by a no and you don't have to be so I realized I don't have all the answers [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnYlBUoiP9Y&t=350.78s)]
