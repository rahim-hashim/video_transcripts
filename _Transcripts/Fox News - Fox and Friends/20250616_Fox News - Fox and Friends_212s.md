# Judge to issue major ruling in Trump, Harvard legal battle
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c)
*  So today an Obama-appointed judge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=0.0s)]
*  is set to rule on President Trump's ban on visas [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=2.24s)]
*  for foreign Harvard students. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=4.76s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio pointing to national security [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=6.08s)]
*  concerns after Harvard refused to provide [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=9.64s)]
*  details on illegal activity by foreign students [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=11.72s)]
*  or their ties to foreign governments. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=14.88s)]
*  Joining us now is Fox News legal analyst Greg Gerrard. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=17.0s)]
*  So this goes back to the power of the executive. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=20.28s)]
*  And what they're really asking is to vet these students. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=23.2s)]
*  Can a judge rule against this? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=27.04s)]
*  Well, I think this judge will, not necessarily [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=30.96s)]
*  based on the law, Lawrence. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  You know, the government, not universities, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  control immigration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=39.52s)]
*  And Congress delegated that power to the president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  Specifically, under the Immigration Act, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=44.24s)]
*  he can suspend entry of foreign students [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=46.88s)]
*  if it is, quote unquote, detrimental [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=50.0s)]
*  to the interests of the US. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=52.8s)]
*  So at Harvard, their own report, their own study, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=54.96s)]
*  incriminates them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=59.0s)]
*  It describes in clear detail the detriment, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=60.12s)]
*  virulent anti-Semitism targeting Jewish students [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=64.0s)]
*  and allegedly foreign students were involved. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=67.64s)]
*  So the administration logically shut down [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=70.12s)]
*  that program on the basis of safety and national security. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=73.52s)]
*  But, you know, as I say, this judge, an Obama appointee [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=77.76s)]
*  who consistently rules against the Trump administration, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=81.92s)]
*  intends to ignore all of that and issue an injunction. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=86.36s)]
*  I do think, though, in the end, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=90.24s)]
*  if the case goes to the Supreme Court, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=92.32s)]
*  they'll side with the president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=94.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=96.12s)]
*  Because they did so seven years ago [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=96.96s)]
*  in a very similar case upholding his authority, Lawrence. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=99.28s)]
*  So I guess the big question is, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=103.2s)]
*  and honestly, it can be a question for many of the cases, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=105.0s)]
*  is there a way to skip this legal delay? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Because that's what it is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=112.84s)]
*  They realize they're gonna be overturned at the high court, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=113.68s)]
*  but they want to delay the president's agenda. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Is there a way to skip all of this nonsense [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=119.0s)]
*  and go straight to the Supreme Court [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  for not just this case, but all of these other cases? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=123.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=128.64s)]
*  You know, if they lose on the injunction, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  as we think they will, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=132.6s)]
*  the Trump administration can file an emergency petition [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=133.84s)]
*  before the Supreme Court, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=138.12s)]
*  although I suspect SCOTUS would rather [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=139.48s)]
*  intermediary appellate circuit court weigh in on this first. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=142.92s)]
*  That's what happened, as I say, seven years ago. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=147.72s)]
*  But I think the point here is if universities do nothing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=151.28s)]
*  to stop the anti-Semitism on campus, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=154.76s)]
*  and if they refuse to protect students from harassment [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  as it occurred at Harvard and elsewhere, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=161.88s)]
*  if they fail to comply with federal oversight, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, look, Lawrence, they lose certain benefits, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=167.6s)]
*  whether it's federal funding or visas for foreign students, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  because coming to the US to study, that's a privilege. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  It's not a right, it's not a guarantee. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=177.48s)]
*  And you know, Harvard could have avoided all of this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=179.56s)]
*  if it simply turned over the data to DHS that was requested, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=182.6s)]
*  but they refused and decided to sue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, here we are. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they care more about their ideology [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  than the safety of their students on campus. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=195.04s)]
*  Really sad. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=198.48s)]
*  Thanks, Greg. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=200.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwLMsFWS_c&t=201.28s)]
