# Ex-Ukrainian general makes grim declaration: 'WWIII has begun'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc)
*  Fox News alert now the former commander in chief of the Ukrainian Army making the grim declaration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=0.0s)]
*  World War three has officially begun as the country faces pressure from North Korea and Iran [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=5.0s)]
*  Now Russia retaliating with new ballistic missiles after Biden gave Ukraine the green light to fire long range attack missiles into Russia [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=10.0s)]
*  And the UK did gave their green light with their storm shadows [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=18.0s)]
*  So let's bring retired four-star General Jack Keane [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=22.0s)]
*  So you see the response from Putin an experimental intermediate range missile [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=25.0s)]
*  Why do you think Putin fired back like this? What's he worried about? General? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all Putin is really a master of psychological warfare and in the Soviet Union and Russian playbooks [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=36.0s)]
*  It always has been a a major part of their conducting you know kinetic warfare [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=43.0s)]
*  And and he's he's really quite good at it. I mean look at it. He's forced the Biden administration [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=50.0s)]
*  Never to give the Ukrainians what they wanted when they wanted it and it protracted the war [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=55.0s)]
*  So Putin keeps coming and that's what this is all about. He wants to stop the use of attackums [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=60.0s)]
*  Into Russia because they he knows full well it already has that can have some pretty significant impact [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=67.0s)]
*  And and certainly that's where he is and and that's what he's trying to get inside of Biden's head here in the Europeans head [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=76.0s)]
*  I think he cares less about Zelensky because he knows that Biden controls the switch here and that's the reality of it [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=83.0s)]
*  So in my mind is is an experimental missile. I doubt they have any arsenal of it because it is experimental [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=92.0s)]
*  They don't have much of it and and he's trying to use this as much leverage as he can [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=99.0s)]
*  To change the behavior of the United States and and also Zelensky [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=103.0s)]
*  He says the missile goes 2.5 miles per second. The world's current air defense cannot stop it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=107.0s)]
*  According to what we have. So that's the message he sent. So these two could the former military commander in Ukraine writes this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=113.0s)]
*  Soldiers from North Korea are standing in front of Ukraine. Let's be honest [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=121.0s)]
*  The Iranian Shahidi missiles are killing civilians drones. It is obvious that Ukraine already has too many enemies [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=124.0s)]
*  When I say this is a world war you feel like this is a world war beginning [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=131.0s)]
*  Well, I have some empathy for so lose me by the way for our audience [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=137.0s)]
*  You know, he used to be the chief of staff of all the forces in Ukraine [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=142.0s)]
*  He's hot. He's highly respected. But you know, you're sitting where he is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=146.0s)]
*  You can understand his feelings about this. I mean, he's fighting Russia and now another nation state has come into the war [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=150.0s)]
*  To assist in the overthrow of Ukraine and to truth be known all the escalation is talk is all been about the United States [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=157.0s)]
*  Giving you the green light to Ukraine to use a tackums and moving in mines [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=166.0s)]
*  The real escalation is there's another nation fighting on the ground inside of Ukraine attempting to inside of Russia [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=172.0s)]
*  Attempting to push the Ukrainian forces out of it. That's significant. He looks in the Middle East and he sees Russia's ally [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=182.0s)]
*  Also who started a war there Iran and Iran is a tangible provider of assistance [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=188.0s)]
*  So from his perspective that indeed may be the case from our perspective [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=195.0s)]
*  No, but I do believe we are in a pre war era. I've said that many times China Russia Iran North Korea are serious [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=200.0s)]
*  Seriously cooperating together and they clearly want to change the United States leadership in the world with like-minded democracies [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=208.0s)]
*  That's why they've been so aggressive and so sort of these last three three or four years and German intelligence actually [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=217.0s)]
*  Publicized recently I was amazed that they put this in a public domain and I was gratified that they do and I suspect [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=224.0s)]
*  Our intelligence agencies feel much the same but I have no knowledge of that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=232.0s)]
*  The reality is is they said that Russia fully intends after the Ukraine is finished with to expand into Europe and and all the European nations know that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=237.0s)]
*  And and certainly I think our country knows that I I know that as well so yes, we're on it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=248.0s)]
*  We're in a pre war era. We're already there's already two wars in our geographical key areas the Middle East and Europe and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=254.0s)]
*  President Xi is threatening war obviously in the Indo-Pacific region the incoming administration given [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=261.0s)]
*  President Trump strong views in the past and what he has done to confront adversaries [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=270.0s)]
*  I believe all of these adversaries are reassessing as a result of the election that took place in the United States [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=275.0s)]
*  And then I think believe when President Trump comes forward and his team and they can begin with policy formulation [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=283.0s)]
*  That will be another moment for them to see if they have to change the path the very aggressive path that they're on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=289.0s)]
*  Right. They actually have that intent. I think you think the Russians have that intent even if they don't have the army right now to do it [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=298.0s)]
*  That's their goal. General Jack Keane. Thanks so much. Appreciate it and pick up the Institute study a war get it daily [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=305.0s)]
*  Sometimes twice a day in order to keep up with all the hot spots in the country. Thanks so much. And I have a great weekend [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=311.0s)]
*  Yeah, you and a team to have a wonderful weekend. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian kill me and I'm Ainsley Earhart [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwO03c1oVgc&t=318.0s)]
