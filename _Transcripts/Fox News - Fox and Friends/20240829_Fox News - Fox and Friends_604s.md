# New polling shows voters trust Trump over Harris on key 2024 issue
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM)
*  All right, today's going to be a busy day out on the campaign trail. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=0.0s)]
*  The vice president is going to sit down for her first interview in over a month since [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=3.92s)]
*  she's been at the top of the ticket along with her running mate, Tim Walz. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=8.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, Axios is calling out here saying there are burning questions that the vice [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=12.24s)]
*  president needs to answer on her growing number of policy flip-flops. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=16.34s)]
*  Yeah, she's basically taking the Trump platform. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=19.84s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson joins us live. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=21.88s)]
*  Hey, Lucas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=23.48s)]
*  Well, good morning, guys. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=24.48s)]
*  It's the moment we've all been waiting for. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=25.48s)]
*  Vice President Harris sitting down for her first interview that will be taped alongside [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=27.52s)]
*  her running mate, Tim Walz, after weeks of dodging the press since Biden dropped out [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  of the race. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=36.12s)]
*  Now, a new Reuters Ipsos poll shows Harris leading Trump 45 to 41 nationally. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=37.12s)]
*  She also has a 13-point lead among women and Hispanic voters. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=42.58s)]
*  And this new Fox News poll shows Harris with a slight lead over Donald Trump in Arizona, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Georgia and Nevada, states Trump narrowly lost four years ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=51.6s)]
*  In North Carolina, Trump is up a point in a state he won back in 2020. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  And Axios, as you mentioned, Lawrence, out with what it calls the 10 burning questions [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=60.08s)]
*  Harris needs to answer that are a record. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=63.81999999999999s)]
*  I'll read just five of them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=65.92s)]
*  Price gouging. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=67.72s)]
*  Could you define price gouging for the American public? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=68.72s)]
*  Taxes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=71.2s)]
*  When you say only the wealthy will see their taxes increase, how high should they go? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=72.19999999999999s)]
*  Immigration. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=76.56s)]
*  What changed from you to shift from calling a border wall un-American in 2018 to now saying [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=77.62s)]
*  you'd sign a bill that ensures more of the wall is built? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=83.04s)]
*  Inflation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=86.2s)]
*  What was the inflation rate when you took office? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=87.2s)]
*  That seems pretty straightforward. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=89.56s)]
*  Supreme Court reform. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=91.28s)]
*  Will you ask any Supreme Court justices appointed by Democrats to resign after 18 years? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=92.28s)]
*  Here is a woman who is trying to break the ultimate glass ceiling, and she needs to drag [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=99.4s)]
*  waltz with her? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=106.04s)]
*  I mean, even the Wall Street Journal said she needs a crutch. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=108.12s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=111.98s)]
*  The woman's been in this race for 38 days. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=113.14s)]
*  She should be able to do a solo press interview that's not edited. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=116.42s)]
*  And President Trump is back on the campaign trail today with stops in Michigan and Wisconsin, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=122.74s)]
*  so it's good thing Rachel's on set today, guys. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=127.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=129.98s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=130.98s)]
*  Wisconsin expert. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=131.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=132.98s)]
*  Thank you very much, Lucas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=133.98s)]
*  Thanks, Lucas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=134.98s)]
*  Thanks for booking it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=135.98s)]
*  You know, it's really incredible that media organizations, because we only get one interview, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=136.98s)]
*  have to get their questions answered by proxy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=140.9s)]
*  Everyone is putting up what they would ask the Vice President of the United States because [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  she only has agreed to one interview. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=147.82s)]
*  As JD Vance said yesterday, is she going to show up to the debate wearing a blue suit [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=151.34s)]
*  and a red tie? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  Because there's so much that she has done to run from her record, run from her three [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  and a half years as Vice President, and run to Donald Trump with strong on the border, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=160.22s)]
*  his economic principles, as well as the immigration when it comes to building the wall and repurposing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=164.42s)]
*  the $650 million that's still out there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=169.94s)]
*  And that she talks about law enforcement. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=172.54s)]
*  Just looking at the polls right now, it's not a major bounce for somebody that had the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=175.06s)]
*  momentum of not being Joe Biden, momentum of naming a running mate, momentum of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=179.62s)]
*  DNC. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=183.26s)]
*  All these battleground states are within shouting distance. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=184.66s)]
*  Here you have the Georgia number. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=187.46s)]
*  And that's where Donald Trump is today. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=189.74s)]
*  Well, you know, Fox News came out with these sunbelt state polls and Donald Trump is still [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  I believe in the state of North Carolina within the margin of error. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  So as they do this bus tour through Georgia, apparently the strategy is the Democrats think [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=202.38s)]
*  that Georgia is actually in play and they always win Atlanta. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  So what they're trying to do with this bus tour is they're going to go to Southeast Georgia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=214.32s)]
*  They're the swing polls, right, or rather the sunbelt polls. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=218.26s)]
*  And Kamala Harris just a little ahead of Trump goes to show you how much a difference can [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  make. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=227.12s)]
*  Anyway, as I started to say, they can all the Democrats can always win Atlanta, but [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=228.12s)]
*  they're going to the Southeast because they're trying to lose by a smaller margin. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=232.08s)]
*  And that could be one of the reasons why the Trump campaign and the Trump's largest super [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=238.74s)]
*  pact have spent more money buying TV ads in Georgia in the first two weeks of the Kamala [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  Harris campaign than they spent in the entire year. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=250.88s)]
*  So it does. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  And Brian Kemp told us, among other things, and has said the road to the White House runs [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=255.62s)]
*  through Georgia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=260.28s)]
*  And this year it looks like it does. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=261.28s)]
*  Yeah, it sure does. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=262.8s)]
*  And so of course, they're trying to on the Kamala side, kind of pump their numbers up [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=263.8s)]
*  in rural areas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=268.92s)]
*  Or they're trying to run this like we're we're now for hunting and camo hats and pretend [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=269.92s)]
*  like they're, you know, all down with that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=274.76s)]
*  We'll see if that works. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=277.36s)]
*  Here's Brian Kemp saying Trump is smart to just stay focused on the issues that matter. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=278.36s)]
*  Listen, I think what he's done in the last few days and what the campaign's been doing, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  talking about specific messages like he did with our with our veterans, with the National [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=288.48s)]
*  Guard honoring heroes that we have lost specific things on the economy, his visit to the border. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, those all drought draw direct contrast with the Kamala Harris record. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=301.44s)]
*  The sugar high on this economy is wearing off all the money that Biden and Harris have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=308.64s)]
*  doled out to really buy votes in a lot of different ways and starting to wear out when [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=312.72s)]
*  people go to the grocery store, the gas pump, the rent and other things, the affordability [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=318.0s)]
*  and cost. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=323.34s)]
*  I mean, the joy of buying a happy meal at McDonald's is worn off because people are [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=324.34s)]
*  getting hit in their wallet every single day. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=329.24s)]
*  And that's what this race needs to be about, needs to be about the economy, cost, the 40 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=331.76s)]
*  year high inflation that really Joe Biden and Kamala Harris created. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=336.68s)]
*  They're taking credit now for inflation going down. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=341.2s)]
*  Hell, they created it to start with. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=344.24s)]
*  I have a couple things here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=346.52s)]
*  First thing, I like how two grown men, Donald Trump as well as the governor here, put away [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=348.64s)]
*  their differences and link out for the greater of the country and the greater of the party [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=355.16s)]
*  and say, listen, we may disagree on some things, we may have duked it out, but we both want [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=359.44s)]
*  to win. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=363.36s)]
*  We're going to put it aside. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=364.36s)]
*  That's how grown men handle things. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=365.36s)]
*  You duke it out and then you move forward. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=367.04s)]
*  I do that with Brian sometimes. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=368.04s)]
*  Sometimes he makes me upset. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=369.04s)]
*  And then I just give him a big hug and say, you know, for the good of the show, we move [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  forward. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  Which is good for the country. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  But Brian asked a great question. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  You did a couple great questions with the governor. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  You asked him if Trump would go into Atlanta and try and make some ground there and appeal [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=381.82s)]
*  to black voters, black business owners, as Lawrence talked about. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=388.04s)]
*  You also asked him if he would basically hug it out and campaign alongside Trump. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=391.74s)]
*  He didn't give you an affirmative, but it sounds like he's open to it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=397.82s)]
*  They're going to do it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=399.86s)]
*  I don't think he's going to add to that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=400.86s)]
*  I hope they do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=401.86s)]
*  There's too much at stake and it doesn't make any sense because they both like each other. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=402.86s)]
*  It's all about the 2020 election and I don't think anybody wants to talk about that right [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=406.26s)]
*  now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=411.06s)]
*  So here's the question that should make Trump feel good. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=412.06s)]
*  Who do you trust who's better on the economy? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=415.22s)]
*  Not as much as over Joe Biden, but what Trump's job is to do is to pin the economy, binomics, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=418.96s)]
*  on the vice president, which should not be tough. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=426.53999999999996s)]
*  So a lot of times you have surrogates who want to be president or want to be senator [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=429.32s)]
*  and you've got to force them to adapt the record of your party. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  You're actually asking her to take responsibility for her administration. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=437.28s)]
*  So that shouldn't be that hard unless she's going to say, I'm so glad I'm out from underneath [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=440.64s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=445.88s)]
*  Let me tell you what I wanted to do as opposed to what's been done. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=446.92s)]
*  That number is from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=450.48s)]
*  Those are the swing states. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=455.04s)]
*  And I think that matters. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=456.04s)]
*  Do you want a candidate that's going to be out there campaigning to make sure that you [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=457.04s)]
*  get taxes? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=461.96s)]
*  We still have not heard from Kamala Harris on where she stands on the Trump taxes. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=462.96s)]
*  Actually we did. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=467.92s)]
*  The old Kamala Harris says that she's going to get rid of that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=468.92s)]
*  So when she goes to Georgia, is she going to tell the business community that she's [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=471.32s)]
*  going to raise their taxes or will she campaign like they did the last time and say your vote [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=475.64s)]
*  is going to be depressed even though we had a historic election of more turnout at any [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=480.4s)]
*  other time? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=485.4s)]
*  If we can go back to that graphic that we were going to put out, the manufacturing job [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=486.4s)]
*  losses in swing states, this is so key because we keep hearing diverting opinions on where [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  manufacturing is in this country. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=494.0s)]
*  They have lost 17,400 manufacturing jobs in Michigan as the Biden administration. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=496.36s)]
*  In Wisconsin, they lost 2,000 overall. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=501.4s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, 8,300. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  So Trump was in the process by dropping the corporate tax rate and other reasons for bringing [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=507.48s)]
*  manufacturing back to the country. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=512.16s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden gets out there and says, I brought it back. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=513.88s)]
*  Well, the numbers don't lie. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=516.8s)]
*  You didn't. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=518.52s)]
*  And regarding the numbers with the brand new Fox News poll with those Sunbelt states, those [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=519.52s)]
*  opinions were asked of people after RFK Jr. dropped out of the race. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=524.48s)]
*  And there's that number right there, more by a significant amount, trust Donald Trump [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=530.68s)]
*  when it comes to the economy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=536.48s)]
*  The problem for Donald Trump right now regarding RFK is he drops out and he says, okay, vote [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=538.28s)]
*  for Donald Trump. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=545.0s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr. cannot get off the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan because with third [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  party candidates, they just don't do it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=552.52s)]
*  So even though he's said, vote for Donald Trump, when people go and vote, they get the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=555.12s)]
*  ballot in the mail or they go in person, there Robert Kennedy Jr. is going to be on the ballot. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=559.88s)]
*  There are some states where Biden is still on the ballot and I think there are Republicans [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=564.96s)]
*  who are running those states. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=569.6s)]
*  They ought to play hardball and do the same darn thing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=570.6s)]
*  Republicans need to play hardball and Donald Trump should come out and talk about that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=574.64s)]
*  for sure. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=577.4s)]
*  Here's another... [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=578.4s)]
*  What would they do? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=579.4s)]
*  Have to write it in? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=580.4s)]
*  Would they have to write in Kamala Harris? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=581.4s)]
*  I don't know what state Joe Biden is still on the ballot. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=582.68s)]
*  Let's do some research on the brain room and see about that because I think that's a very [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=586.56s)]
*  interesting question. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=589.68s)]
*  Since she's been officially nominated, I don't know. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=591.68s)]
*  I'm Steve Giussi. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6s1qaT5mM&t=594.12s)]
