# Expert predicts the fate of Trump’s legal cases if he’s elected
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4)
*  We're just nine days away from the election, and former President Trump is still battling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=0.0s)]
*  a full slate of legal challenges on everything from election interference to appealing the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=4.16s)]
*  verdict of the civil fraud trial. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=8.8s)]
*  So what happens to those cases if he's elected president? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=10.96s)]
*  Let's ask former Whitewater deputy independent counsel and Fox News contributor Saul Weisenberg. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=14.4s)]
*  Saul, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=18.8s)]
*  Overarching. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=21.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is elected president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  What happens to all of these cases? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's start with the federal cases. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  He has the authority to ask his attorney general to order his attorney general to fire Jack [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=32.0s)]
*  Smith and to dismiss the federal case in D.C. and the federal case in Florida. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=37.02s)]
*  The problem is he's not going to have his team in place at DOJ right away. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=44.24s)]
*  They're going to be holdovers there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=48.08s)]
*  So what he needs to do is have in waiting a qualified acting attorney general he can [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  appoint and then put those steps into motion, because, you know, the Senate's jealous of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=55.76s)]
*  its prerogatives. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=60.64s)]
*  It typically does not confirm appointments right away. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  So what happens then? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=67.16s)]
*  What happens if Trump has an acting attorney general in there who does fire Jack Smith [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=68.4s)]
*  and move to dismiss these cases? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=73.72s)]
*  Well, it ain't over yet. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=75.6s)]
*  Judge Cannon in Florida, federal judge, we can expect her to agree to DOJ's motion to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=77.68s)]
*  dismiss. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=84.76s)]
*  They can't just say we dismiss, it's in court. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=85.76s)]
*  So she'll have to approve that with an order. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=88.48s)]
*  She'll do it, I think. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=91.72s)]
*  But Judge Chuckin in D.C. is unlikely to do that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=92.76s)]
*  If you recall, when Bill Barr moved to dismiss the indictment against Michael Flynn, rightfully [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  so in my opinion, the judge there, Emmett Sullivan, refused to do it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=101.28s)]
*  And so Flynn had to be pardoned ultimately before Trump left office. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  So it'll be litigated. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=112.24s)]
*  I think ultimately, President Trump will win that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  But it won't be quick and easy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=118.33999999999999s)]
*  It won't go through dismissal, you're saying. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=120.32s)]
*  It'll be litigated. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=121.96s)]
*  Being a sitting president actually wouldn't change the equation in that particular case, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=123.8s)]
*  even if you were able to get Jack Smith replaced. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=127.6s)]
*  That's the federal trials. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=130.24s)]
*  Go to the state side, because there's a couple of those as well, most notably right here [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  in New York. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=134.42s)]
*  Well, obviously, he's got a lot less influence over the state cases. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=137.04s)]
*  He can't just go in and order the state to dismiss the cases. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=142.56s)]
*  However, right now, he's got statutory and constitutional issues being litigated. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=146.64s)]
*  In the New York case, where the verdict was against him, and in the Georgia case, it hasn't [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  gone to trial yet. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  But even assuming that he loses his constitutional and statutory arguments there, it's hard for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=159.16s)]
*  me to believe that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to let a sitting president have to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=165.14s)]
*  undergo, while he is president, a lengthy Georgia state criminal RICO trial. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=171.38s)]
*  And certainly, I don't believe that the Supreme Court will allow, while Trump is president, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=176.74s)]
*  any state process to put him in prison, which would potentially happen in New York State. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=183.9s)]
*  So he's in a much better position. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=189.94s)]
*  Clearly in a much better position, but it doesn't just magically disappear, to your [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=192.9s)]
*  point, neither in the state cases or even in the federal case in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=195.9s)]
*  So just worst case scenarios, Saul. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=200.14s)]
*  These cases continue. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=202.5s)]
*  He's convicted in a state court, perhaps, but he's sitting president of the United States. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=203.98s)]
*  How does the Supreme Court intervene? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=208.34s)]
*  To your point, they wouldn't allow this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=210.5s)]
*  What's the mechanism for the Supreme Court to go, no, you're not doing this with a sitting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=212.7s)]
*  president? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=216.74s)]
*  Well, somebody's got to litigate it and try to bring it to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  But Trump's lawyers have shown that they don't have any problem doing that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=222.58s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, don't forget also, even under Trump versus Anderson, the ballot case [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=226.02s)]
*  where they tried to take him off the ballot as an insurrectionist, Supreme Court left [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=230.94s)]
*  open the possibility that Congress, before Trump takes office, or even before he takes [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=235.06s)]
*  But after the new Congress is there, depending on who controls Congress, Congress could enact [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=243.66s)]
*  a mechanism to say that Trump was an insurrectionist. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=249.54s)]
*  That's unlikely, but if the Democrats control the Congress, they can, under the 14th Amendment, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=252.98s)]
*  set up a process whereby there could be a finding that Trump engaged in insurrection [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=259.5s)]
*  and then try to keep him from taking office. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=264.26s)]
*  Okay, we still have an election. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=266.66s)]
*  That's the big hurdle we're talking about, these presumptions under the scenario that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=268.7s)]
*  Trump wins the presidency. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=271.86s)]
*  Let's get through that first. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU8K1GWIh4&t=273.62s)]
