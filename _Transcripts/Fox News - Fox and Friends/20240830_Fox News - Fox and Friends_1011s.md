# JD Vance reacts to Kamala Harris' CNN sit-down: This was 'pretty bizarre'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q)
*  All right, we got some news today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris finally gives her first [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=1.26s)]
*  official interview as a Democratic nominee, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=3.24s)]
*  promising a new way forward. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=6.36s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=8.6s)]
*  One of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=10.08s)]
*  and strengthen the middle class. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=17.52s)]
*  of the American people, I think that people are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=22.84s)]
*  ready for a new way forward. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=26.96s)]
*  Day one, it's going to be about one, implementing my plan [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=29.32s)]
*  for what I call an opportunity economy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=32.32s)]
*  I've already laid out a number of proposals in that regard. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=34.56s)]
*  But Harris struggled to lay out her day one agenda, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=38.76s)]
*  having difficulty explaining her flip-flopping on policies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=41.88s)]
*  I think the most important and most significant aspect [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=46.68s)]
*  of my policy perspective and decisions [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=51.08s)]
*  is my values have not changed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=54.36s)]
*  You mentioned the Green New Deal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=56.76s)]
*  I have always believed, and I have worked on it, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=59.6s)]
*  that the climate crisis is real. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=62.68s)]
*  That value has not changed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=64.56s)]
*  My value around what we need to do to secure our border, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=66.36s)]
*  that value has not changed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=69.48s)]
*  OK, this as Harris faces criticism [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=71.28s)]
*  for having Governor Walz by her side during the interview, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=74.24s)]
*  Politico is reporting, quote, a senior campaign official also [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=77.88s)]
*  made the important stipulation that obviously she [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=81.6s)]
*  will do solo interviews in the future as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=84.44s)]
*  Somebody who does interviews every day, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=88.72s)]
*  does extemporaneous speaking, we saw him yesterday, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=90.36s)]
*  is vice presidential candidate, Ohio Senator, JD Vance. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=93.4s)]
*  JD, good morning to you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=96.96s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  So last night we watched the 27-minute interview [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=100.96s)]
*  that CNN did. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=105.0s)]
*  And Dan Abash did ask a lot of the questions [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=107.52s)]
*  we wanted answers to. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=110.88s)]
*  And one of the most important things [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=112.56s)]
*  was how do you, Vice President Harris, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=114.0s)]
*  explain the flip flops? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=117.44s)]
*  But as we just heard in that sound bite, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=118.88s)]
*  she's not flip flopping because she has the same values. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=128.12s)]
*  So if you have the same values, why have you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=129.4s)]
*  changed your mind on literally every topic [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=131.32s)]
*  that you previously held an opinion on? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=133.24s)]
*  But I think it's important for us not to buy this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=135.28s)]
*  If you look at the way that Kamala Harris is governed, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  she's actually governed as a far left person. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=139.88s)]
*  She's just trying to pretend that she's not far left now, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=142.68s)]
*  because of course she wants to win the American people's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=145.04s)]
*  votes over the next couple of months. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=147.0s)]
*  But if she does, she's going to do the same thing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=148.56s)]
*  that she's been doing for the last few years. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  She's going to try to make it harder [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=152.68s)]
*  to get American energy from American territory. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=154.2s)]
*  She's going to make it harder for us [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=157.6s)]
*  to drive down the cost of everything, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=159.2s)]
*  from food to housing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=160.92s)]
*  She's going to make it harder for us [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=162.2s)]
*  to enforce our border laws. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=163.72s)]
*  And she's going to make more chaos and more instability [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=165.28s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=168.68s)]
*  It's really absurd for Kamala Harris to sit there and say, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=169.96s)]
*  well, I don't actually believe in any of the things [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=173.24s)]
*  that I told you I believed three years ago. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=175.4s)]
*  She has governed as a person who believes those things. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=177.44s)]
*  And unfortunately, the American people [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=180.16s)]
*  are far off because of it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=181.96s)]
*  So Senator, she's flipped on the EV mandates [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=183.4s)]
*  through the Green New Deal, the border wall, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=186.64s)]
*  decriminalizing the border cross, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=188.64s)]
*  Medicare for All, which she was a co-sponsor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=190.44s)]
*  I mean, that's a major flip. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=192.76s)]
*  The mandatory gun buyback, fracking, apparently [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=194.24s)]
*  she supports it now, and offshore drilling. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, I know it's only been two years into politics [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  for you, Senator, but politicians, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=203.16s)]
*  they changed their position. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=205.2s)]
*  But the problem I have with Kamala Harris, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  and it's much like when you graciously invited me [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  into your home, I want to know why she changed her position. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=211.2s)]
*  You told me why you changed your position on Donald Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=215.76s)]
*  Why aren't we hearing why she changed? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=218.6s)]
*  Well, in part because she refuses to give interviews, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=223.76s)]
*  So this is her first interview in 40 days. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  Of course, she's flanked by her VP colleague there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  But she's not a person who actually knows, I think, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=231.92s)]
*  why she believes the things that she says that she believes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=234.28s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=237.48s)]
*  She did impose an EV mandate, which [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=238.32s)]
*  is going to ship a lot of American manufacturing jobs [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=240.72s)]
*  to China. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=243.24s)]
*  She has supported the Defund the Police movement, which [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=244.04s)]
*  has made a lot of our cities much more violent, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=246.88s)]
*  and a lot of our neighborhoods much less safe. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=249.12s)]
*  She has done all of these things as she's been in government. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=251.32s)]
*  And again, now she's trying to run away from it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=255.12s)]
*  And I agree with you guys. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  She should have to sit and answer tough questions about why [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=258.32s)]
*  she's changed her mind. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=261.04s)]
*  I think she answered one question yesterday [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  about how she changed her mind. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  It was a bit of a world salad, and I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  don't think it actually gave Americans any insight [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=267.44s)]
*  into who Kamala Harris really is. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=269.8s)]
*  The final point that I'll just make about how [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=272.12s)]
*  she was trying to explain her changed perspectives [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=274.16s)]
*  is if you actually watched what she was saying, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=276.44s)]
*  the way that she was saying it, it's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=278.92s)]
*  clear that she doesn't have very strong convictions. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=280.72s)]
*  Even though I'm running against her, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  I felt a little bad for her because it was clear [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=286.11999999999995s)]
*  that she wasn't totally sure-footed, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  and she didn't totally know why she was saying the things [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=290.88s)]
*  that she was saying. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=294.11999999999995s)]
*  She's been coached to pretend to be a moderate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  Unfortunately, guys, she's governed [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  as a San Francisco liberal, and because of it, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=299.88s)]
*  Americans are poorer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  The world is more chaotic, and our border is wide open. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=303.52s)]
*  We've got to take this country in a new direction, which is why [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=306.32s)]
*  we've got to elect Donald Trump. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=308.84s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Pennsylvania, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  because that is a very important state. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  And fracking, which matters a lot [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  to the people in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=315.56s)]
*  Here is Kamala Harris on fracking. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=317.0s)]
*  No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=321.0s)]
*  that I would not ban fracking. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=324.92s)]
*  As vice president, I did not ban fracking. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=327.24s)]
*  As president, I will not ban fracking. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=329.6s)]
*  I made very clear where I stand. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=331.68s)]
*  We are in 2024, and I've not changed that position, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  nor will I going forward. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  I kept my word, and I will keep my word. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=337.16s)]
*  My values have not changed. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=339.04s)]
*  I believe it is very important that we take seriously [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  in terms of the climate. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=350.04s)]
*  And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=351.88000000000005s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  by my calculation, over probably a trillion dollars [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=358.72s)]
*  over the next 10 years, investing [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  in a clean energy economy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=364.16s)]
*  What we've already done, creating over 300,000 new clean [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=365.92s)]
*  energy jobs, that tells me, from my experience [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=369.88s)]
*  as vice president, we can do it without banning fracking. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=373.84s)]
*  Senator, and here she is back in 2019. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=382.76s)]
*  your first day in office, adding the United States [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=386.2s)]
*  to the list of countries who have banned [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=389.24s)]
*  this devastating practice? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=391.08s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=392.24s)]
*  So, Senator, how do you be simultaneously [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=395.36s)]
*  for the Green New Deal and now for fracking? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=398.6s)]
*  Well, you can't. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=404.16s)]
*  Those are just totally inconsistent positions. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=405.0s)]
*  And I actually think that Kamala Harris [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=407.04s)]
*  may have told an explicit lie on top [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  of what she's already said here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=412.56s)]
*  So think about this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris says that she changed her mind in 2020 [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  on the debate stage. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=417.72s)]
*  Her last debate was in 2019 because she dropped [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=419.16s)]
*  out of the race before it really got to voting. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=422.0s)]
*  So she's saying that she changed her mind on fracking [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=424.56s)]
*  during her general election debate. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=427.28s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  She definitely did not do that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  So I think that Kamala Harris got away [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=431.52s)]
*  with a very dishonest sort of revision of her record there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  But then let's go back just to how this affects the lives [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  of American families and American workers. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=441.08s)]
*  Fracking is one of the main ways that we have [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=443.44s)]
*  to drive down the cost of energy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=446.08s)]
*  And if you think groceries are expensive now, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=447.96s)]
*  what happens when we increase the cost of energy [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  even further, making it hard to get the food [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  to the grocery store? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=455.2s)]
*  If you think the cost of housing is bad now, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=456.16s)]
*  what happens when we increase the cost [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=458.8s)]
*  of producing the materials that go into the houses, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=460.56s)]
*  which is what a ban on fracking would do? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=463.12s)]
*  She is pursuing a policy, guys, that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=465.16s)]
*  is going to make Americans poorer in their own country. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=467.56s)]
*  And it's so fascinating. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  The media is so desperate to let her get away with this [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  that they don't even push her on the fact [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=476.12s)]
*  that she's changed her mind, allegedly, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  on eight different topics. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  And the final thing is the proof is in the pudding. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris can say that she's changed her mind [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=484.16s)]
*  on American energy or changed her mind on police [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  or changed her mind on immigration. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=489.0s)]
*  She is the sitting vice president of the United States. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=490.68s)]
*  If she's changed her mind, why doesn't she [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=493.76000000000005s)]
*  enact these policies now and make Americans better off? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=496.16s)]
*  I don't think she believes it, which is why you're not seeing [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=499.16s)]
*  it in what she's doing. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=501.48s)]
*  And Danabash kind of asked about that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=502.44000000000005s)]
*  You've been vice president for 3 and 1 half years last night. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=504.68s)]
*  We know what she's doing with these new positions, Senator. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=508.24s)]
*  She is racing to the middle. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=512.12s)]
*  Because when there's one, you're way out there on the fringe [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=513.68s)]
*  when you're in the primary, and then you race to the middle [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=517.64s)]
*  in the general. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=519.68s)]
*  And that's what she's doing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  But she said, and obviously she's [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=521.52s)]
*  fishing around for Republican votes as well, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=523.76s)]
*  because she was asked, and she said [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=525.68s)]
*  that she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  And we've seen that in the past. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=533.64s)]
*  GWB did it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=534.92s)]
*  Barack Obama did it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=535.92s)]
*  Would a Trump-Vance administration, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=538.0s)]
*  would you guys appoint a Democrat to your cabinet? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=541.16s)]
*  Oh, of course we would, Stephen. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=546.64s)]
*  We've actually got a lot of great Democratic support. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  We just got RFK, of course, Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=551.48s)]
*  who endorsed the president in just the last couple of days. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=553.4s)]
*  If you look at the Trump movement in 2024, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  it's actually the commonsense Big Tent [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  movement in American politics. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=561.48s)]
*  We don't agree on everything, of course. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=563.0s)]
*  Not everybody who votes for Donald Trump [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=564.88s)]
*  is going to agree with every policy issue. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=566.42s)]
*  But we agree on the basics. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=568.52s)]
*  We agree that American energy prices should be lower. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=569.84s)]
*  We agree that we should be making more of our own stuff [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=575.0s)]
*  We agree that we should close down the border [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=576.6s)]
*  and stop the flow of illegal drugs [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=578.84s)]
*  and trafficking into our country. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=581.08s)]
*  It's just the basic, common sense stuff. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=582.84s)]
*  And it's telling that Kamala Harris wants to say [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=585.1600000000001s)]
*  that she's the Big Tent candidate. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=588.72s)]
*  She wants to say that she stands for a totally different [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  platform than what she ran on three years ago. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  But she's governed as a radical. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=595.96s)]
*  She will govern further as a radical. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=597.64s)]
*  And Donald Trump has the record of lower prices, higher wages, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=599.82s)]
*  and peace across the world. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=603.7s)]
*  The contrast is extraordinary. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=605.1400000000001s)]
*  We just have to remind the American people [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=607.0600000000001s)]
*  that the proof is in the pudding. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=608.82s)]
*  And Donald Trump did a good job. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=610.1800000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris did a bad one. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=611.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, Senator, we've been following [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=613.4200000000001s)]
*  what's been happening at the border. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=614.94s)]
*  And now it's here at home. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=616.34s)]
*  Chicago's, the Venezuelan gangs, and the United States gangs [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=618.1s)]
*  are going back and forward. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=622.1400000000001s)]
*  You've got Colorado now, where we have, apparently, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=623.46s)]
*  some illegal migrants that have taken over apartment [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=626.24s)]
*  complex. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=629.5s)]
*  We had the councilwoman on from that area. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=630.66s)]
*  This is what she said. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=633.14s)]
*  Watch, Senator. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=634.18s)]
*  I currently know of four others. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=636.1s)]
*  That's just in Aurora. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=638.02s)]
*  I do believe that there are some in Denver. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=640.3s)]
*  Denver police officers are starting to speak out. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=643.18s)]
*  We need to be arresting these guys for the smallest crimes [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=645.66s)]
*  that they're committing, putting them in jail, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=647.78s)]
*  figuring out who they are. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=649.66s)]
*  We don't even know who they are. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=650.94s)]
*  They came across the border. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=652.26s)]
*  We're probably lightly vetted, probably have criminal [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=653.5s)]
*  backgrounds in Venezuela because we don't share background [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=656.02s)]
*  information with Venezuela. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=659.02s)]
*  We really need to start putting boots on the ground [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=660.5s)]
*  and arresting these guys for shooting up cars, all the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  assaults that they're committing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=665.46s)]
*  So, Senator, one of the problems is the local cops [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=667.38s)]
*  can't do anything. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=669.74s)]
*  They can't talk to ICE. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=670.78s)]
*  So these people can't be deported because it's a sanctuary [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=672.22s)]
*  state. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=674.6999999999999s)]
*  What does a Trump-Vance administration do differently? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=675.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, we end sanctuary cities [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=681.38s)]
*  and we end sanctuary states. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=683.46s)]
*  If you've got illegal immigrants in your communities, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=684.98s)]
*  they need to go home and you need to cooperate with local [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=687.26s)]
*  and federal law enforcement to help get illegal immigrants [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=690.14s)]
*  out of our country. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=693.22s)]
*  Guys, if we don't have a border, we do not have a real [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=693.82s)]
*  country. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=696.62s)]
*  All these problems that exist primarily in Central America, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=697.1s)]
*  we're now seeing them in places like Aurora, Colorado, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=700.6600000000001s)]
*  or Chicago, or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, because Kamala [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=703.9s)]
*  Harris has allowed us to import the business of the drug [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=707.4200000000001s)]
*  cartels into our own communities. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=710.58s)]
*  And Americans are suffering because of it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=712.58s)]
*  We cannot overstate this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=714.82s)]
*  I was talking to national firefighters yesterday. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=716.66s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of dollars in Chicago, in New York, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=719.9s)]
*  in Pittsburgh, all across our community, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=722.78s)]
*  are going to pay for the problems related to the border. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=725.3s)]
*  You're housing illegal migrants. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=729.18s)]
*  You're trying to deal with the drug overdoses that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=731.18s)]
*  come from illegal migrants. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=733.26s)]
*  We should be spending that money on more police, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=734.82s)]
*  more firefighters, more municipal services. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=737.18s)]
*  But these local governments are being totally destroyed [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=739.66s)]
*  because they're paying for Kamala Harris' open border. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=742.7s)]
*  But Senator, real quick. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=745.3s)]
*  We can do so much better. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=746.26s)]
*  Real quickly. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=747.02s)]
*  We just need common sense leadership. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=747.34s)]
*  I know we only got a little bit at a time. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=748.66s)]
*  But I'm curious. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=750.34s)]
*  The sanctuary city, sanctuary state, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=751.8199999999999s)]
*  if Trump vans administration is there, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=754.74s)]
*  does that now become against federal law? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=756.9s)]
*  Is there going to be a bill to say, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=759.22s)]
*  you cannot be a sanctuary state. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=761.5s)]
*  You cannot be a sanctuary city. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=763.06s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=766.9399999999999s)]
*  It needs to be against federal law. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=767.7s)]
*  And we need to be willing to use the purse strings [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=769.14s)]
*  of the federal government. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=771.38s)]
*  If a local city is not willing to cooperate [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=772.46s)]
*  with deporting violent criminals, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=775.3000000000001s)]
*  then we need to say, well, then maybe we're not [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=777.22s)]
*  going to give you as much money as we used to. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=779.3000000000001s)]
*  We have got to end the practice of sanctuary cities. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=780.9000000000001s)]
*  It's making our communities poorer and less safe. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=783.7800000000001s)]
*  Senator, yesterday, former President Trump [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=787.0600000000001s)]
*  announced that he wants to make IVF treatments free [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=788.94s)]
*  if he becomes a president. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=792.94s)]
*  So you're talking here to a mom of nine kids. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=794.5s)]
*  So I obviously believe more babies are better. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=796.46s)]
*  But I actually was kind of a little bit taken aback, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=800.86s)]
*  because last week you were talking about making Americans [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=804.34s)]
*  healthy. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=808.78s)]
*  We clearly have a fertility problem. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=809.46s)]
*  Something is going on in our country, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=811.3000000000001s)]
*  because infertility is exploding. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=813.42s)]
*  And there's something, whether it's in the food, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=816.7s)]
*  in the environment, it could be cultural as well, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=818.74s)]
*  that we're encouraging girls to start having women [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=821.38s)]
*  to have babies a lot later. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=823.78s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of pro-life friends of mine. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=826.54s)]
*  And they're saying, it's one thing to say, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=828.54s)]
*  I'm not going to ban IVF. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=829.78s)]
*  It's an entirely other thing to say, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=831.5s)]
*  we're going to pay for it, or we're [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=834.1s)]
*  going to mandate insurance companies to pay for it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  And a lot of them said that that smacked to them, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=839.54s)]
*  like Obamacare mandating contraceptive mandates. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=842.06s)]
*  So what's your response, particularly [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=845.9s)]
*  the pro-life community, which has [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=847.66s)]
*  been so supportive of this ticket and the advances [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=849.02s)]
*  that Donald Trump has clearly made in that area? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=852.06s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, you know I'm pro-life. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=857.14s)]
*  And I want to save as many babies as possible. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=859.18s)]
*  I think it's important for us to recognize that there [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=861.18s)]
*  are a lot of fertility problems. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  And we ought to be talking about the root causes. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=865.62s)]
*  But President Trump has always been pro-fertility treatment [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=867.6999999999999s)]
*  to address some of the problems, too, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=870.5s)]
*  that young women are facing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=872.18s)]
*  I mean, you know this. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=874.38s)]
*  I know this. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=875.5799999999999s)]
*  We've all had family and friends that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=876.18s)]
*  have gone through infertility problems. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=877.78s)]
*  It is a nightmare. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=879.62s)]
*  And I think all President Trump is saying [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=880.54s)]
*  is that we want to make it as accessible as possible. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=882.26s)]
*  Of course, we're going to respect religious liberties. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=884.5799999999999s)]
*  We're not going to force anybody to do something [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=886.74s)]
*  that is against their conscience. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=889.02s)]
*  But we also want to make this fertility stuff available [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=890.54s)]
*  to as many people as possible because babies are good. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=893.02s)]
*  And for a whole host of complicated reasons, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=896.46s)]
*  we've got a lot of women and a lot of young families [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=898.54s)]
*  that are struggling with this. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=901.3s)]
*  We, of course, want them to have happier, healthier lives. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=902.5s)]
*  And we want American women to have as big a families [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=905.5s)]
*  as they would like to have. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=908.38s)]
*  And unfortunately, we know that's not happening right now. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=909.78s)]
*  What do you say, Senator, to those in the pro-life community, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=911.6999999999999s)]
*  some now that are so angered that they're saying some of them [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=914.8199999999999s)]
*  may stay home? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=918.1s)]
*  Why is that a bad idea? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=919.34s)]
*  Well, it's a bad idea, first of all, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=923.1s)]
*  because all the president has said [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=924.66s)]
*  is he wants abortion to be made at this policy [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=926.14s)]
*  to be made at the state level. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=928.94s)]
*  He wants California, Florida, Ohio [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=930.34s)]
*  to fight this stuff out and to have debates [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=933.26s)]
*  among their citizens rather than having a national one size [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=935.82s)]
*  fits all approach. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=939.22s)]
*  And I think the genius in President Trump's approach [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=940.4200000000001s)]
*  here is that he's actually giving [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=942.74s)]
*  the individual voting populations the room [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=944.62s)]
*  to figure this stuff out. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=947.1s)]
*  You guys know, again, I am a pro-life person. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=948.58s)]
*  We had a pro-life referendum in the state of Ohio. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=950.98s)]
*  It didn't go the direction that I wanted it to go. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=953.5s)]
*  And I think what I take away from that [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=955.66s)]
*  is that those of us in the pro-life community, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=957.66s)]
*  we've got to do a better job of persuading [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=959.74s)]
*  our fellow citizens. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=961.62s)]
*  But even if you disagree with something [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=962.5400000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump has said, look, Kamala Harris [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=965.4200000000001s)]
*  wants to force Christian hospitals [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=967.62s)]
*  to perform abortions. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=969.34s)]
*  She wants taxpayer-funded abortion [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=970.66s)]
*  up until the moment of birth. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=972.6600000000001s)]
*  The Democrats are utterly radical on this. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsfIg2SgN5Q&t=974.1s)]
