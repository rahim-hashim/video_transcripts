# Rubio tapped for key role after White House shakeup
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY)
*  So Michael Waltz is out as National Security Advisor. President Trump announcing yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=0.0s)]
*  he'll be nominating Waltz to become the UN ambassador. He'll be in New York City. Taking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=5.76s)]
*  his place for now, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The last person to do both National [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=9.92s)]
*  Security Advisor and Secretary of State was Henry Kissinger. Can it work? Fox News Senior [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=14.48s)]
*  Strategic Analyst, retired four-star general, General Jack Keene joins us now. General, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=19.32s)]
*  can you do both jobs? Well, yes, I mean, and it has a lot to do with the president. Richard [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=24.64s)]
*  Nixon appointed Henry Kissinger after Nixon won the election in 68 as his National Security [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=32.8s)]
*  Advisor in 69. And then after the next election in 72, William Rogers, who was Secretary of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=38.34s)]
*  State for the first term, was not asked to come back for the second term. And he appointed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=46.44s)]
*  Henry Kissinger as his Secretary of State in 73. But the reality is that Richard Nixon [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  served eight years as Eisenhower's Vice President, and he was very much involved internationally [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=58.16s)]
*  during those years. And as such, he centered policy development and policy execution in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=63.6s)]
*  the White House, because he was almost daily involved in it with Henry Kissinger. And he [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=71.4s)]
*  never trusted the State Department. Many people in the State Department, Henry Kissinger told [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  me this himself, and he said, you know, the way the State Department acts is many of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  people in the State Department think they know more about foreign policy than the Secretary [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=90.12s)]
*  of State, and that's the reality of it. So power was definitely centered there, most [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=93.76s)]
*  unusually to the degree that he chose to do it. I mean, obviously, the president is the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  center of foreign policy decisions. There's no disputing that, and that's the case in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=105.08s)]
*  the Trump administration for sure. But that was kind of the uniqueness of it. It only [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=109.24s)]
*  lasted from 73 to 75. Ford came in 74 after Nixon resigned and kept it for one more year [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=114.4s)]
*  and then appointed a Secretary of...then appointed another security adviser. So it was different. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=123.2s)]
*  Kissinger was a national security adviser first and then became Secretary of State here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=130.67999999999998s)]
*  Marco Rubio was Secretary of State, taking on the NSA. I mean, it is tough to do both [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=137.2s)]
*  jobs. There's no doubt about that. But certainly Marco Rubio, I think, is very much up for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=142.88s)]
*  that task. Yeah, they say Stephen Miller, Michael Anton, and Rick Grinnell are three [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=150.2s)]
*  people that have been mentioned for that job. So let's talk about the historic nature of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=155.16s)]
*  the U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal. Russia's weighed in on it. It says Trump has finally pressured [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=159.16s)]
*  the Kiev regime to pay for our U.S. aid and mineral resources. Now military spies will [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=164.56s)]
*  have to be paid for with the national wealth of a disappearing nation. Really? So that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=169.04s)]
*  doesn't sound like a country that's looking for a way to...an off-ramp to stop fighting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=174.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is really a blow to Putin because everything he's been doing, he's been [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=179.36s)]
*  trying to maneuver the Trump administration away from Ukraine as much as possible. And [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=187.36s)]
*  that's part of his strategic ploy here and the narrative of his playbook that he's been [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=193.8s)]
*  executing. But this is significant. This is a generational relationship that the United [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=198.28s)]
*  States has signed into with Ukraine. Obviously it's economically based, but because of it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=203.8s)]
*  it's also politically based and it has significant security implications. Look, for that to succeed, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  there has to be stability and security in Ukraine or else there's not going to be much [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=217.44s)]
*  mining going on if there's a war going on. So there's implications here going forward [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=223.36s)]
*  for security as well. Yes, and that is a blow to Russia for certain. And no doubt the emotional [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=228.72000000000003s)]
*  response we're getting from Putin is understandable from his perspective. So at some point we [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=235.92s)]
*  have to decide what we're going to do because Russia's not playing ball and the talk about [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=241.76s)]
*  sanctioning their central bank, which has not been touched yet, and there's more aid that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=246.0s)]
*  Biden had left over that the Congress has already allocated. And now you could use equity [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=250.32s)]
*  in the deal to buy weapons from the Pentagon. Here's Secretary of State Marco Rubio on what [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=255.0s)]
*  could be next. We've got so many, I would argue even more important issues going on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=261.76s)]
*  around the world. Not that a war in Ukraine is not important, but I would say what's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=267.44s)]
*  happening with China is more important in the long term for the future of the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=271.2s)]
*  Obviously Iran's nuclear ambition, all these other things that we have going on. So at [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  some point in time it either has to be something that can happen, we all need to move on. That'll [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  be a decision the president will have to make. I don't love that tone. I want to find a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=284.48s)]
*  resolve moving on. I just think it's in our national interest to find a way to do something. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=289.12s)]
*  Well, listen, the fact of the matter is that Putin, when you look at it for 38 months, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=294.12s)]
*  if you look at where the positions were when he began the invasion in 22, 38 months later, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=302.64s)]
*  if you look at an ISW map comparing them, there's not that much difference. There's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=310.28s)]
*  been some, yes, some small tactical gains that have been made across the entire Donbass [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  region for sure, but largely nothing compared to what he wanted was huge terrain operational [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=321.04s)]
*  gains. It did not happen. In 25, he's got equipment problems and severe personnel problems. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=329.04s)]
*  So at the end of the day, I still believe Putin will come to the negotiating table, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=335.88s)]
*  but he's stalling to get as much concessions as he can at a Trump administration. What [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=341.92s)]
*  should we do? Up-gun Ukraine with military assistance, not so they can fight a war indefinitely, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=346.72s)]
*  but to force Putin to the table. Go with the sanctions, crippling economic sanctions. This [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=353.88s)]
*  time the real thing, oil, oil, oil, and central banks. Senator Graham has got 70 plus senators [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=359.36s)]
*  lined up as well. We've got to take the gloves off here, I think. Force him into it. The [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  idea that he's going to stay there and fight a protracted war for years to come and he's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=372.6s)]
*  eventually going to win is not true. That's a false Russian narrative. He has major, major [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=377.2s)]
*  problems. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=384.68s)]
*  Make him pay the price for walking away. The status quo is not going to work for us. That's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=387.0s)]
*  what I hope. General Jack Keane, thanks so much. We'll be sure to keep up with the Institute [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=390.16s)]
*  Study of War to get the absolute latest and most accurate information. Thanks, General. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=394.52s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjrjpDyIGY&t=398.44s)]
