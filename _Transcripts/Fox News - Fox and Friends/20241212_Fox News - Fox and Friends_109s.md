# Syrian prisoners let loose after Damascus falls
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw)
*  Fox News or Syrian rebels and civilians celebrating, celebrating the overthrow of Bashir Assad's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=0.0s)]
*  regime. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=7.12s)]
*  These are live images out of Damascus. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Impossible to imagine this just a couple of weeks ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=11.32s)]
*  Chief foreign correspondent Trey Yanks joins us live after him is making his way to the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=13.92s)]
*  capital city. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=18.36s)]
*  Trey, what's it like? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=19.52s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, good morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=21.92s)]
*  We saw those celebrations just a few hours ago in a main capital city square in Damascus. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=23.88s)]
*  But as they were celebrating overhead, you could hear Israeli fighter jets circulating [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=30.28s)]
*  and then a large explosion. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  And it gives you a sense of how active this front remains because this is a country that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  is now ruled by Syrian rebels. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=40.92s)]
*  And the Israelis are concerned that those rebels could get their hands on some of the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Syrian government equipment that was left behind. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  And it comes as we continue to follow stories out of Syria following the fall of Bashar [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=49.74s)]
*  al-Assad. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=54.18000000000001s)]
*  We visited the major prison outside of the city limits today and saw hundreds of families [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=55.18000000000001s)]
*  looking and searching for loved ones who were taken prisoner under the last regime. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Many of them disappeared. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=66.7s)]
*  And unfortunately, it looks like most of them were killed by Assad's forces. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=67.7s)]
*  So we continue to investigate that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=72.42s)]
*  But it is a new chapter for Syria. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=74.02000000000001s)]
*  It is a country that is both mourning and celebrating as it looks forward. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=75.7s)]
*  Brian? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=79.7s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like we're bringing more troops in that area to protect the 900 already there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=80.7s)]
*  Historic times as Trey Yanks gets his way to the capital of Syria, something would have [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  been impossible to conceive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=89.18s)]
*  So real quick, Trey, is this your first time there? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=90.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=94.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=95.5s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=96.5s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us4NitAD3Rw&t=97.86s)]
