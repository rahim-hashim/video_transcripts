# US troops attacked for a 59th time in Middle East
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk)
*  We are back with the Fox News alert. Listen to this. Overnight, U.S. forces in the Middle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=0.0s)]
*  East attacked for the 59th time last month. That's right. Kurdish officials say an armed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=6.2s)]
*  drone targeted an air base in northern Iraq. It is unclear if anybody was hurt at this [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=13.3s)]
*  point. And earlier, thank you, Stephen, earlier in Israel, mourners gathering at the funeral [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=18.82s)]
*  of an IDF hostage whose body was found during Israel's ground offensive in Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=24.1s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel with the latest. Hey, Trey. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, hey, guys. Good morning. The Israeli forces continue to operate around the Shefa [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=34.1s)]
*  Hospital in the heart of Gaza City. They say they've uncovered a tunnel on the complex, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=38.7s)]
*  and this yet still does not provide all of the details of what they say are currently [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=44.4s)]
*  underneath the Al-Shefa Hospital. The Israelis say this is a headquarters for Hamas. They've [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=49.0s)]
*  shown these new images of the tunnel system, they say, is underneath the hospital and weapons [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=53.5s)]
*  also in the radiology department. But we've yet to see any evidence about this headquarters [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=58.8s)]
*  they speak of. Also, we know that the Israelis have recovered the bodies of two hostages [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=63.4s)]
*  near to the Shefa Hospital. This was a devastating update for the Israeli people who [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  continue to hold out hope for those nearly 240 hostages being held inside Gaza. The first [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=73.3s)]
*  body they announced, Yehuda Weiss, a woman in her 60s from the small kibbutz of Paris. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=79.2s)]
*  She has five children. She was being treated for breast cancer and she was dragged into [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=84.3s)]
*  Gaza on October 7th. There was hope that she was alive, but again, Israeli forces have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=89.2s)]
*  recovered her body near Shefa Hospital. The second, as you note, a 19-year-old soldier [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=93.6s)]
*  that was taken into Gaza on the day of the massacre, Noah Marciano, and she was in a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=98.3s)]
*  hostage video released by Hamas. Ultimately, they released also a photo of her body saying [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=103.9s)]
*  that she was killed in an Israeli airstrike. This comes as the Israeli forces are pushing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=108.4s)]
*  deeper into Gaza City. They say they took over an Islamic jihad stronghold gathering [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=112.7s)]
*  some rockets. You can see in this video here, it's not clear if the larger rockets are props [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=117.5s)]
*  that they use in military parades or the real thing, but the Israelis say they blew up the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=122.2s)]
*  compound and they continue, as you can hear behind me, to strike targets in the northern [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=126.8s)]
*  part of the Gaza Strip amid reports they may be preparing to enter southern Gaza. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHexbPYKOk&t=131.0s)]
