# 'INCONVENIENT': Trump calls for elimination of Daylight Saving Time
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs)
*  Well, I told my wife about this next story a little bit earlier this week and she said he just keeps winning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=0.0s)]
*  He keeps doing the right thing from doge to how about doing away with daylight savings time president trump put this out on truth social [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=3.36s)]
*  Last night. He said the Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate daylight savings time, which has [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=9.68s)]
*  a small but strong [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=15.36s)]
*  Constituency, but shouldn't daylight savings time is inconvenient and very costly to our nation and you both [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=17.2s)]
*  We're really happy and we had a little debate earlier about yes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=23.6s)]
*  What we all agree is we want to we want consistency. Yes, right? Yeah percent and I want it to be lighter later [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=26.64s)]
*  So whatever that is, I think you were explaining that maybe that is actually daylight saving time [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=33.84s)]
*  Versus standard time, but all I want is it to be late light light or light late like nine o'clock in night [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=39.24s)]
*  I want it to still be in the summer and be outside having a good time [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=45.6s)]
*  I'm gonna cede my time to you because you have a lot of thoughts on this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=49.6s)]
*  Well and a lot of so do a lot of you yeah, we have heard from you this morning [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  So I made the argument earlier that I'd rather keep daylight saving time [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=57.0s)]
*  Year around instead of keeping standard time because I think like Kevin and on most of us we would not everybody but we would like [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  Late sunset. Yes. Yeah, we'd like more time. So look at this graph. I'll try to do my best to explain [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=67.6s)]
*  Little can feel yeah, it is okay [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=72.52s)]
*  So I'm gonna so what you're looking at on the left side of your screen is sunrise [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=74.52s)]
*  Okay, this is Sunrises and it says the number of people that get a sunrise before 7 a.m [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=80.06s)]
*  Okay on the right side. It's sunset. Do you get a sunset after 6 p.m? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=85.7s)]
*  Which is what you want. Uh-huh. Now I want you to go to the three rows across [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=90.62s)]
*  This is what we have now. So the lighter the color the more yellow that means you get the sunrise and the sunset [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? I know it's confusing. Hold on. This middle one is daylight savings time abolished [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=101.08s)]
*  What you want is yellow for your state [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=106.26s)]
*  Okay [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=108.26s)]
*  Now this is what Trump's proposed the middle one now daylight savings times always in effect is which I said Kevin what you see on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=108.62s)]
*  You get a lot of sunsets. That's the bottom right, right? But you lose your sunrises [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=115.38s)]
*  So all I'm saying is if you look at this and you want yellow [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=119.82s)]
*  Trump's right [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=123.1s)]
*  Daylight savings time [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=124.74s)]
*  Abolished you get a lot of yellow, right? You know on both sides the sunrise and the sunset. Did I did I explain it? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  I mean this may be an indictment on my intelligence, but I didn't follow any of that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=132.7s)]
*  Yeah, you got up you I wish you had like a marker [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=139.9s)]
*  I bet you I bet you there are people out there who followed it's it's just me the Karl Rove [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=146.18s)]
*  Board with the marker that I think that part of what you did taps into the direction [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=151.3s)]
*  part of my brain where people give me like [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=156.74s)]
*  Turn left and then you go to this street and then you go right and I'm like [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  You're speaking in great great [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  I have no idea like no north south east west [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=165.2s)]
*  Not at all. It's like turn left. I am not Lewis and Clark. I have no idea [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=168.44s)]
*  You tell me like ghosts like you're on this north side of the building. I'm like I am inside right now. You're hilarious [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=172.28s)]
*  How are you telling me this now? Obviously this is struck a chord with some of our viewers [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=177.16s)]
*  We got an email from Chaz and it says quote put me down for never changing the time [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=181.44s)]
*  But keeping the time set to always daylight saving time good for you now Ronald says that what do you say there? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=187.6s)]
*  Well, you pick this one up [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=195.0s)]
*  He says instead of setting clocks back in the fall set them one hour ahead [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Then you get an additional hour of daylight in the afternoon and then in the spring set them back one hour [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  So he's flip-flopping them the days are longer and you don't lose anything Ronald [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay, Suzanne says here's my two cents worth. I prefer standard time [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=211.12s)]
*  Okay, so that's what you don't want. Well, I don't know I'm reconsidering [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=215.88s)]
*  I don't like the Sun to set at 9 p.m [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=221.4s)]
*  In the summer and I don't want the Sun to not rise until 830 in the morning [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=224.96s)]
*  Suzanne makes a great point, you know [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=229.68s)]
*  It certainly makes commuting tougher when it's darker in the morning and I've heard people say and I sort of grew up [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=231.32s)]
*  In on the plains of Great Plains and you know, you're out there you're working you work in the fields and kids are walking to school [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=236.56s)]
*  I remember walking to school in the morning and it would be dark fairly off [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  Right and a lot of people are saying hey listen, let's just get away from daylight saving for that reason [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=245.55999999999997s)]
*  But I happen to love it when it's lighter. Yeah, I just say pick one and stick with it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it will all chameleon and you know get used to whatever it is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=254.2s)]
*  Honestly, I'm a little bit like you my head swims a little bit. Yeah, like what Suzanne said I'm like [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=260.24s)]
*  Yeah, good for you out there. You're smart what she said. I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyRjbywq_Hs&t=265.15999999999997s)]
