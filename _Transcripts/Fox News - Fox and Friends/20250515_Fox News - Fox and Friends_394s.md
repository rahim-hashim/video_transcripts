# Rand Paul: They're finally saying 'enough is enough'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE)
*  HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defending massive cuts to his department while appearing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=0.0s)]
*  at a pair of confrontational congressional budget hearings yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=5.84s)]
*  Did somebody, can Elon Musk computer and say, okay, just make 20% cuts? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=10.36s)]
*  You know, I disagree with your entire characterization. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=17.64s)]
*  It was like the recitation of a narrative that, you know, everybody knows out there, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=20.16s)]
*  and it's the Democratic Party narrative. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=27.0s)]
*  Do you disagree with the cuts that are being proposed for Medicaid right now? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=29.0s)]
*  Oh, the cuts to, you know, this is a, I don't know if you understand this or whether you're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=32.28s)]
*  just mouthing, you know, the Democratic talking boys. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=38.28s)]
*  Cuts to Medicaid are for fraud, waste and abuse. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=42.68s)]
*  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul was at the Senate hearing and joins us now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=47.84s)]
*  Good morning to you, Senator. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=51.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=53.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=54.36s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=55.36s)]
*  Well, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=56.36s)]
*  We've talked about some of the waste that we've had to cut from our budgets. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Tell the folks at home some of the studies that were cut. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=61.68s)]
*  Well, I compliment Secretary Kennedy and the Trump administration for finally saying enough's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=64.96s)]
*  enough. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=70.52s)]
*  We're not going to keep funding frivolous and crazy research. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=71.52s)]
*  I pointed out three grants yesterday. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=74.56s)]
*  One was nearly three quarters of a million dollars to study microaggressions against [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=77.16s)]
*  obese Latinx. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  And I say that slowly because most people don't even know what that means to unpack [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=85.44s)]
*  what is microaggressions against obese Latinx, but surely doesn't sound like science. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Another study I pointed out was do happy rats use more cocaine than unhappy rats? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=94.64s)]
*  The last one, and this one is very, yeah, this is the last one is even more profound. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  Do girls who think they are boys still have a problem with pregnancy? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  And lo and behold, girls who think they're boys can still get pregnant, be warned. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=111.14s)]
*  And but they have a special study that costs nearly three quarters of a million dollars [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=116.66s)]
*  also. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=120.18s)]
*  So this kind of craziness has been going on not for a couple of years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=121.18s)]
*  This didn't start in the Biden years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=124.54s)]
*  This has been going on since the 70s. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=125.94s)]
*  William Proxmire complained about it for two decades. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=128.18s)]
*  I've been complaining about it for a decade. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=130.78s)]
*  But finally, we have someone, President Trump, willing to stand up and say enough's enough. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=132.96s)]
*  And he's requesting a reduced budget for these grants. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=138.4s)]
*  That's the only way you'll direct the money towards more significant disease like obesity, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=141.4s)]
*  heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, autism. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=146.8s)]
*  That's where the money ought to go. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  But it shouldn't go to these crazy loony things that any common sense American would say are [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  nuts. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=156.68s)]
*  And then there was that exchange with Senator Murray. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=157.9s)]
*  And I know you witnessed that where she was saying, I have a constituent in my area. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=160.36s)]
*  She can't get into this clinical trial. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=164.62s)]
*  She has stage four cancer. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=166.56s)]
*  She needs to be in it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=168.96s)]
*  And he said, have her call my office. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=169.96s)]
*  I'll see what's going on. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=171.96s)]
*  Then you'll take a recess. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=173.96s)]
*  He comes back and he said, I just did my research to find out about her case and she's ineligible [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=174.96s)]
*  for this trial. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=179.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=181.96s)]
*  And I talked to him again last night about it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=182.96s)]
*  He wants to do whatever he can, obviously, to make sure anybody who's eligible can get [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=185.96s)]
*  in a trial. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=190.96s)]
*  But the way trials work are, and these are very desperate, you know, people are in the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=191.96s)]
*  of dying from cancer and they want any kind of chance they can get. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=197.74s)]
*  But if you're too far along, sometimes you don't qualify for the trial. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=201.38s)]
*  So the trial is trying to determine if you're stage three, can we add some months to your [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=205.18s)]
*  life? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=209.86s)]
*  But it's not showing progress for four. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=210.86s)]
*  I think there should be a compassionate use, like a right to try outside of the trial. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=213.66s)]
*  But the trial has to stay rigid because the trial is trying to determine, you know, if [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=218.34s)]
*  you put everybody that was stage four and they all died, you'd say, oh, the medicine [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  doesn't work. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=226.0s)]
*  But maybe if you give all stage three, it prolongs their life six months and people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=227.0s)]
*  have to decide is work taking the chemotherapy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=231.44s)]
*  But this was really a falsehood put forward by the Democrat senator to say it was because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  of reductions in manpower and cuts. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=240.6s)]
*  And instead, it was completely legitimate based on the medical criteria and is really [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=243.44s)]
*  a disgusting way to use someone to use someone as a pawn who actually is desperate to try [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=248.44s)]
*  to hang on to life, to use that person as a pawn for political purposes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=254.62s)]
*  I think it's unforgivable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=258.58s)]
*  Yeah, Senator, her name is Natalie Phelps. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=259.82s)]
*  If people out there want to pray for her with her cancer. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=262.02s)]
*  Also, let's talk about the big, beautiful bill. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=264.9s)]
*  I know you're still a no on that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=266.7s)]
*  Sean Hannity asked the president about the debt ceiling. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=268.06s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=270.82s)]
*  I think a lot of Democrats are going to be forced to vote for the bill because, you know, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=272.82s)]
*  you add this new element that if this bill passes, you're going to get a 50 to 90 percent [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=276.22s)]
*  reduction in prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=282.36s)]
*  When you add that in, how does a Democrat not vote? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think they can win an election if they don't vote for it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=290.92s)]
*  But even if you don't include it, I think that the Republicans are very unified and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  something would happen where they will get this vote. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=299.04s)]
*  Senator, what do you need to see in this bill to be on board? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=302.24s)]
*  The problem is, is it's asking conservatives like myself to raise the debt ceiling five [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  trillion dollars. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=311.94s)]
*  That's historic. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=314.38s)]
*  No one's ever raised the debt ceiling that much. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=315.38s)]
*  It will be a record for Congress to raise the debt five trillion dollars. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=317.38s)]
*  But also it indicates that this year the deficit will be over two trillion, but it means they're [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  anticipating close to three trillion for the next year. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=326.78s)]
*  It's really a slap in the face that those of us who are excited about Elon Musk and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=329.86s)]
*  Doge and all the cuts, where are the cuts? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=334.12s)]
*  If the cuts are real, why are we going to borrow five trillion? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  So what I proposed was this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=340.16s)]
*  I put forward a proposal and we voted on it to raise the debt ceiling for three months. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=341.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=346.16s)]
*  Because I think we should vote on the debt ceiling every three or four months to see [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=347.16s)]
*  if they're doing their job. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=350.04s)]
*  If they promise us cuts in spending, not just the administration, I'm talking about congressional [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  leaders as well. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  If the promises are real, I'll vote to raise it every three months. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=357.6s)]
*  So I put forward that amendment. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=360.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, I only got a handful of votes, but I think that's the way to do it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=362.58s)]
*  If you raise it five trillion for two years, you just put it on the back burner, but we're [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=366.5s)]
*  going to coast through that money and we're going to spend it all. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=370.82s)]
*  And that's not what the people want. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=373.82s)]
*  That's not what our supporters want. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=375.18s)]
*  All right, Congressman, sorry. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=376.7s)]
*  Senator, maybe y'all can come to an agreement eventually. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=378.58s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on this morning. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=380.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJpihqRfoeE&t=382.58s)]
