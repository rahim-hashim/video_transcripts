# ‘MASSIVE COVER-UP’: Charlie Hurt on Jen Psaki claiming she ‘never saw’ Biden’s decline
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM)
*  Jen Psaki and Democrats are freaking out now over all of the revelations coming out about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=0.0s)]
*  what they knew when about Joe Biden's failing mental state. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=7.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=14.64s)]
*  So here's Jen Psaki again, former White House press secretary, saying she never saw him [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=15.64s)]
*  looking like he was mentally failing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=20.76s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=23.64s)]
*  I hadn't seen him in person during that period of time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=24.64s)]
*  I never saw that person, not a single time, and I was in the Oval Office every day that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=28.8s)]
*  was on that debate stage. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=34.6s)]
*  I'm not a doctor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=36.36s)]
*  Aging happens quite quickly. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=37.56s)]
*  Cover-up is a very loaded term, I think. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=39.44s)]
*  What means you knew that it was really bad and you're pretending otherwise versus you're [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=42.24s)]
*  deluding yourself, which I think is what people do a lot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, I understand, but I still think it's like cover-up is often like a crime, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=47.72s)]
*  People use that term as they relate to Watergate or the covering up of not sharing public information [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=52.84s)]
*  about a war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=58.62s)]
*  I think it's a bit of a dangerous term. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=59.62s)]
*  Yeah, actually, his mental state was a war on the American people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  Because we hire, this is, look at Donald Trump working from 5.30 in the morning until 9 o'clock [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=66.7s)]
*  at night. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=72.74s)]
*  This is the most difficult job in the world, and they lied to us, and she's lying right [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=73.74s)]
*  there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=78.66s)]
*  You can tell she's lying. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=79.66s)]
*  She's like, I just don't like the word cover-up. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=80.66s)]
*  And she says that it's dangerous. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=83.14s)]
*  I think it's an interesting term for her to use. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=84.66s)]
*  The reason she says it's dangerous is because it is dangerous. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=87.34s)]
*  You know what it's dangerous to? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=90.42s)]
*  It's dangerous to their grip on power. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=91.72s)]
*  It's dangerous to the Democrat Party. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  And I think they have done generational damage to their party because of this massive lying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=96.98s)]
*  cover-up that went on for years, and the media, of course, participated. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=103.4s)]
*  It was dangerous to the country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Kevin, we were on the, throughout this man's presidency, ever since he allowed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  the Ukraine war to happen, we've been on the verge of World War III with a guy who was [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=112.38s)]
*  not mentally capable of handling and actually made many missteps around that war that could [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=117.22s)]
*  have gotten us into World War III. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  First of all, you saw it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=125.94s)]
*  You talked about it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=127.6s)]
*  You knew exactly what you were watching. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=129.16s)]
*  You at home, you knew exactly what you were watching. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=131.94s)]
*  And yet they would tell you, oh, I can't keep up with the guy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=135.28s)]
*  He's running marathons. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=137.94s)]
*  He's ice skating. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=138.94s)]
*  I don't know what they were making up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=139.94s)]
*  At the end of the day, they're lying to you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=141.9s)]
*  They've lied to you before, and they're going to keep lying to you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=146.1s)]
*  You just have to know when you see a liar and you hear a liar, you call them out for [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  it, and she's lying to you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=154.42s)]
*  He fell off his bike. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=155.82s)]
*  He couldn't get up the stairs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=157.78s)]
*  I mean, he would get lost on stage. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=159.82s)]
*  And then the worst part is just, like you said, lying. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=162.64s)]
*  Do we not believe? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=166.9s)]
*  Are we not supposed to believe what we saw? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=167.9s)]
*  What about all the books? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=169.66s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=170.66s)]
*  What about all the books, too, Rachel? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=171.66s)]
*  You've got all these guys coming out now writing books saying, oh, behind the scenes, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=172.66s)]
*  people were very concerned. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=176.94s)]
*  So what did they see? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=178.34s)]
*  How could they have seen it and now write books and capitalize on it? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=179.78s)]
*  But you as the press secretary, you mean to tell me that you didn't see it? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=184.26s)]
*  It'd be interesting to know, just because as these books come out, they've been saying [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=188.62s)]
*  that his inner circle was really small. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=192.5s)]
*  And that they would try and keep them out of sight from people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=196.9s)]
*  And so I would think you would have to interact with your press secretary. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=200.82s)]
*  I mean, you see Donald Trump all the time with Carolyn Leavitt. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=204.38s)]
*  How did he not interact with her? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  But of course, it all comes down to Jill Biden. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=208.54s)]
*  She's absolutely the one who is most at fault for the elder abuse that we had to endure [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=211.66s)]
*  as a country for four years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=217.54s)]
*  Well, there's a new era of transparency in the White House, and that is for sure. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=219.22s)]
*  And it's a good thing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=222.22s)]
*  But of course, it doesn't come without plenty of hysterics. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mf0iGFV4rM&t=224.38s)]
