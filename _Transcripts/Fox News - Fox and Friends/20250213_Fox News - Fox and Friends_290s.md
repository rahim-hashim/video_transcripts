# Musk proposes cutting ENTIRE agencies: 'Remove the roots'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U)
*  That Fork in the Road program by Elon Musk, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=0.0s)]
*  75,000 people have said they're going to take the deal. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=2.88s)]
*  I think the number would be higher, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=7.32s)]
*  but there are a lot of people in Washington [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=9.24s)]
*  who would be eligible for that, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=10.92s)]
*  but they're just worried, you know, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=13.56s)]
*  whether or not it's legal, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=15.6s)]
*  whether or not it would actually happen, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=17.0s)]
*  or if they said, hey, I would love to take [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=19.04s)]
*  the free salary for eight months, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=22.06s)]
*  and if it doesn't go through, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=24.28s)]
*  suddenly Elon Musk has got a list of 85,000 people [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=25.36s)]
*  who don't wanna work there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=28.72s)]
*  They would be the first one to go. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=29.88s)]
*  Well, that's why a lot of people didn't sign. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=32.12s)]
*  I heard from some of my friends in DC. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=33.84s)]
*  A lot of people moved during COVID, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=35.68s)]
*  and so they were working from home, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=37.12s)]
*  and they don't wanna go back to DC. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=38.44s)]
*  So, and the program did get the green light from the judge, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=39.72s)]
*  and you're not allowed to sign up for the program anymore [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=42.84s)]
*  if you didn't already. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=44.84s)]
*  So you got 2.5 million federal workers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=45.68s)]
*  He said you all have a chance to leave [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=49.92s)]
*  with your six to eight months pay. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=51.6s)]
*  Then they got frozen by the courts. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=53.64s)]
*  Yesterday got unfrozen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=55.72s)]
*  The union said you can't do that, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=57.56s)]
*  and then the judge essentially said, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=58.96s)]
*  I don't know, can't they make their own decision? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=60.68s)]
*  And he said, yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  So, okay, so it was 60, 80, 90. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=63.44s)]
*  So it would probably go higher than that, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=66.16s)]
*  and then little by little we could, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=67.84s)]
*  and pay them on time so we don't have to do lump sums [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=69.48s)]
*  and take from another area. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=71.76s)]
*  Pay them out, not one big lump sum. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=73.36s)]
*  So don't say that we're taking money away or denying it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=75.6s)]
*  Don't get jammed up there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=78.94s)]
*  And then after eight months, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=80.68s)]
*  you will see everything shrink. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=81.76s)]
*  The one thing that Elon does say is that sometimes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=82.8s)]
*  if I cut too much, I get some back. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=85.64s)]
*  So if one agency is barren, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=87.6s)]
*  barren, no pun intended, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  we're gonna put some people back there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  Surely, well, here's the thing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=94.52s)]
*  Ultimately, I think a lot of the people who didn't sign up, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=96.64s)]
*  and they pulled the plug on the program last night. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=99.52s)]
*  They said, okay, if you haven't signed up yet, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=101.08s)]
*  don't bother because it's closed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=103.24s)]
*  They're worried that it is not legal. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=106.52s)]
*  The judge who was appointed by Bill Clinton [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  back in the 90s, what he said was, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=111.88s)]
*  the unions don't actually have standing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=114.32s)]
*  He did not say whether or not it's legal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=116.36s)]
*  I'm sure that's gonna be adjudicated as well. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=118.12s)]
*  But it would, you know, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=120.16s)]
*  there will be fewer people working in the federal government [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=121.68s)]
*  if Elon Musk is able to get that buyout to work. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=124.44s)]
*  He was actually on just very shortly ago, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=127.64s)]
*  while you were sleeping, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=130.04s)]
*  he did a Zoom call to world governments. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=131.08s)]
*  It was a summit in Dubai. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=134.2s)]
*  And here's what he had to say [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=135.76s)]
*  about entire federal agencies vanishing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=137.48s)]
*  We really have here a rule of the bureaucracy, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=142.8s)]
*  as opposed to rule of the people democracy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  We want to restore rule of the people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=149.28s)]
*  And so what that means is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=151.08s)]
*  reducing the size of the federal government, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  basically reducing regulation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, there's a tremendous amount of overregulation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  that's happened over time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=164.4s)]
*  I think we do need to delete entire agencies. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=165.44s)]
*  As opposed to leave part of them behind. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=172.36s)]
*  Because if you leave part of them behind, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  it's easy, it's kind of like leaving a weed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  If you don't remove the roots of the weed, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=179.84s)]
*  then it's easy for the weed to grow back. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=182.52s)]
*  So with Doge's done and people have done, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=184.68s)]
*  by the way, I love this thing he does. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=187.12s)]
*  So I hear some anecdotal information [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  when he gets in front of his guys, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  his women doing some of this work. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=193.8s)]
*  He'll bring some people in and say, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=195.68s)]
*  you got 15 minutes to explain what you do. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  You know how oftentimes you hear from federal workers [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  or maybe it's you guys out there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=201.36s)]
*  You feel as though you're doing a good job [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=202.96s)]
*  and you don't really cares. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden you have that moment to say, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  wow, you're asking me what I'm doing, great. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=208.52s)]
*  Maybe you hate it because you're getting away with murder, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=211.28s)]
*  getting that check, you know you're not doing anything. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  But if you care about your job, you relish that moment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  Then you add in, this is what I would do if I'm in charge. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=218.84s)]
*  And that's what impresses Elon Musk [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  if you look at his other businesses and most managers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=223.72000000000003s)]
*  I just think that all of a sudden you're in a bis, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  you're in a job, you're in a drab office, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=228.64s)]
*  going to a federal building and you swipe in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=231.64s)]
*  and you feel like, what am I really doing? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=234.32s)]
*  Waiting to retire? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=236.32s)]
*  Well, not anymore, he's gonna make you accountable. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=237.56s)]
*  And believe it or not, Teddy Roosevelt talked about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=239.72s)]
*  doing the same thing, only without the pass. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=241.68s)]
*  He had a different type of security system. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=244.04s)]
*  They're also focusing on immigration [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=244.88s)]
*  and they stripped money from New York City. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  The front page of the New York Post says US versus New York. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=249.0s)]
*  It says Trump administration calls back 80 million [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  for migrant hotels. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=254.4s)]
*  So what happened was that money was approved by Congress [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=255.92s)]
*  in 2023. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=259.28s)]
*  They put it in the bank account last week [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=260.12s)]
*  for New York City to be able to use that money [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=262.08s)]
*  for immigration and for shelters. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=264.0s)]
*  No, the money was for FEMA, federal emergencies. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=265.8s)]
*  And they're using it for the migrants. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=269.84s)]
*  Exactly, so the Trump administration said, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=271.24s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=273.2s)]
*  They went to check the bank account, the money is gone. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=274.2s)]
*  Not just 60, but 80,000. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=276.48s)]
*  80 million. 80 million. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=278.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOzpxEqcW6U&t=288.44s)]
