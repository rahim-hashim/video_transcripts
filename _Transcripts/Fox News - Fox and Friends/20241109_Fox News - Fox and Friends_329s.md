# MSNBC guest makes wild claim about Joe Rogan
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4)
*  You know, I do a thing called a weave. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=0.0s)]
*  If I start a story, what you do is you weave things and you do it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=3.84s)]
*  I always got more publicity than other people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  And I didn't, it wasn't like I was trying. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=10.32s)]
*  In fact, I don't know exactly why. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=12.68s)]
*  Maybe you can tell me why. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=15.52s)]
*  Oh, I could definitely tell you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=16.52s)]
*  You said a lot of wild ****. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=17.52s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=19.6s)]
*  What would you say to them? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=20.6s)]
*  Kids, kids who want to pursue their own version of the American dream and try to achieve their [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  wildest dreams and make it all come true? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=27.18s)]
*  I would say very simply, honestly, vote for Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=29.48s)]
*  47th president elect Donald Trump gained much needed support amongst young Gen Z and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=35.24s)]
*  millennial voters this election. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  Is his son Baron Trump a key reason? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=42.72s)]
*  Joining us now is the host of the Boncino Report, early edition and my daughter, Evita Duffy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=46.28s)]
*  Evita, great to have you on. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=51.84s)]
*  So let's just talk about Baron Trump, but also sort of in a bigger picture, the role [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=53.2s)]
*  that podcasts played in this election, particularly with the mail vote. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, what Baron did, advising his father to take the non-traditional media route was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=64.16s)]
*  really an amazing decision by the Trump campaign. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=69.44s)]
*  Harris did not fill in that gap in the same way. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's why Trump did so much better with young voters than he even did back in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=76.88s)]
*  2020. And it reflects changing media landscape at large. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=81.28s)]
*  You have social media and podcasting like you guys have at Fox station increasingly [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=85.04s)]
*  being more powerful than traditional media, particularly among young people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=91.2s)]
*  So Baron helped Trump meet young people where they're at and at a really unique time, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  because a lot of young men, particularly right now, are revolting against the culture, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=99.28s)]
*  against our institutions that hate them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's why this election, which was supposed to be the revenge of the woman, instead [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=106.2s)]
*  became the year of the man. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=110.84s)]
*  Trump support among men surpassed Harris's among women. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Twenty two points to 14. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=116.0s)]
*  Trump rallied low propensity young male voters, the frat boy vote. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  And it's not a meme vote either. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Right. People kind of think, oh, they're they're voting as a joke because Trump is funny. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=123.24s)]
*  Young men are looking at their future and it's bleak. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=127.36s)]
*  There's a hatred of masculinity, economic ruin, war. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  And they went with Trump, who represents really a middle finger to the culture and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=133.2s)]
*  institutions that are suffocating and demonizing them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=137.6s)]
*  You know, it's you mentioned kind of the characterization of men. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=142.04s)]
*  Here is an example of that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=146.88s)]
*  Political analyst on media ecosystem, how that media ecosystem is turning men into [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=148.64s)]
*  fascists. Watch this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=154.84s)]
*  What they have done in their online media ecosystem is build a radicalization engine, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=156.84s)]
*  literally the way militant groups do around the world, that takes people from relatively [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=163.0s)]
*  low level annoyances with the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Why are eggs so expensive? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=169.92s)]
*  Why is my kid learning this new thing in American history in school that I didn't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  learn? And then moves them through YouTube videos, through podcasts, moves them from [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  that annoyance all the way slowly, slowly, slowly to a full blown fascist politics. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  It's an elaborate, multibillion dollar infrastructure. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=186.0s)]
*  And there is nothing like it on the pro democracy side. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=189.28s)]
*  We don't have an when a man is just lost and lonely and not yet radicalized. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=192.88s)]
*  We don't have the equivalent of Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson to move that man in a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=198.56s)]
*  feminist direction. By the way, we should educate men that it's actually really great [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  to live with a strong woman who makes money. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  It's actually easier. Life is easier. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=210.52s)]
*  The fascist ecosystem needs an alternative where we can feminize men. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Aveda. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=216.36s)]
*  That is one of the most hilarious soundbites I've ever seen, because the only reason why [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=218.12s)]
*  right wingers have a lot of power on in the podcast sphere and alternative media [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  is because the legacy media people at CNN and MSNBC have been excluding right wing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=228.24s)]
*  voices for years now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=232.96s)]
*  MSNBC and CNN. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=234.52s)]
*  I don't know why you guys don't have a Joe Rogan, because you did have a Joe Rogan. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=236.12s)]
*  His name is Joe Rogan. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=240.56s)]
*  He was pro universal health care, pro trans rights. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  He was a Bernie bro. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=244.88s)]
*  And they have excluded anybody who doesn't fit in their specific political box for so [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=246.28s)]
*  long that we've gone in other routes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=251.68s)]
*  This is why people, young people are going for alternative voices. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=253.72s)]
*  Everything in that clip is wrong. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. Like every single thing in that clip is wrong. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  This whole idea that there's a right wing echo chamber that's been built over time to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=263.44s)]
*  service men and move them to the right to radicalize them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=267.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan was on the left. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=269.56s)]
*  Like you did have the biggest podcast in the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=271.56s)]
*  It was named Joe Rogan and you ostracized him like you did. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk and RFK and everybody else. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=277.56s)]
*  Crazy time. Final thoughts, Aveda. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=281.64s)]
*  Well, I'll just say that this has been happening for a long time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=284.36s)]
*  Young men have been moving away from the left for a long time. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=287.6s)]
*  If you're an 18 year old male, you are 11 during Me Too. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=289.6s)]
*  You had the demonization of men for virtually as long as you can remember. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=293.0s)]
*  You had during Covid the schools shut down, no school dances, no sports. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=297.32s)]
*  Young men have felt the the real wrath of the left and they are they're moving away [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=301.88s)]
*  in really extreme numbers and it makes sense. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=307.92s)]
*  And it's not fascism. It's just that Democrats have lost their way with young people. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=310.04s)]
*  All right, Aveda Duffy, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=315.64s)]
*  Morning, Aveda. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jhjWA5ehM4&t=317.48s)]
