# 'WOKE BUBBLE': Nike is 'choosing wokeness over women,' 1986 national gymnastics champion
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA)
*  Well, apparel company XXXY Athletics calling out Nike in a powerful new ad for quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=0.0s)]
*  staying silent and not supporting biological females in women's sports. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=8.0s)]
*  Dear Nike, why won't you stand up for me? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=15.0s)]
*  Why won't you stand up for me? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=17.0s)]
*  Why won't you? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=19.0s)]
*  Why do you claim to support women and girls? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=20.0s)]
*  Yet when we need you most, you remain silent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=22.0s)]
*  Founder of XXXY Athletics and 1986 National Gymnastics Champion Jennifer Say joins us now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=25.0s)]
*  Jennifer, great to see you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=32.0s)]
*  It is a very powerful ad, but it does beg the question, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=34.0s)]
*  why would Nike risk losing 50% of the people that buy sneakers, i.e. I'm talking about women, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=36.0s)]
*  and potentially more if you consider the men who love them to die on this hill? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=44.0s)]
*  Look, Nike has not really ever done right by women. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=50.0s)]
*  They have a history of treating women with astonishing disregard [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=53.0s)]
*  while actually pretending to champion female athletes [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=56.0s)]
*  and profiting off of pretending to champion female athletes, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=59.0s)]
*  which is what I have an issue with. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=63.0s)]
*  I think they live in such a woke bubble, frankly, that they think everyone agrees with them [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=65.0s)]
*  and they think they're doing the right thing and being silent. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=69.0s)]
*  Although one could argue they're not even being silent, they're on the wrong side of this issue. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=72.0s)]
*  Based on an ad they ran about a year ago, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=76.0s)]
*  a social media ad featuring non-athlete Dylan Mulvaney in their running bras. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=79.0s)]
*  So, I don't know, I think they're just sort of choosing wokeness over women, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=84.0s)]
*  and the fact is they've never actually stood up for women. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=89.0s)]
*  If we're fair, Jennifer, I mean, I think that too many moms were silent [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=92.0s)]
*  when this trend with transgenderism creeping into girls' sports was happening, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=97.0s)]
*  and there weren't enough moms standing up, but I think that has shifted. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=102.0s)]
*  I'm just surprised that a company like this, who obviously went the woke route [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=106.0s)]
*  because they thought that was the way to go in terms of advertising, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=110.0s)]
*  are they unable to see the trend even if they don't see it as a moral issue [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=116.0s)]
*  of what they're doing to girls in sports? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=122.0s)]
*  Why aren't they responding and do you think they'll suffer financially for sticking with this agenda? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, you know, they're struggling right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=130.0s)]
*  They've just ousted their CEO and brought in a new one. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=133.0s)]
*  The stock price is down. They're definitely struggling. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=136.0s)]
*  They were just called out actually for stealing a technology from a small business owner [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=139.0s)]
*  and marketing it with trademark technology from a guy in Philadelphia. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=144.0s)]
*  Why couldn't they just pay the guy? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a business that has made their mark by not doing the right thing, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=150.0s)]
*  but pretending to do the right thing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=156.0s)]
*  That's their stock and trade, and I am calling them out for it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=158.0s)]
*  Look, we're a tiny player. We just launched six months ago. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=161.0s)]
*  Nike is the biggest player in sports. It's a $50 billion brand. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=165.0s)]
*  It's bigger than the NFL and the NBA. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=169.0s)]
*  If they stood up for women and girls, the NCAA and the U.S. Olympic Committee would change their tune. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=171.0s)]
*  And so I'm just calling on them to do the right thing here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=177.0s)]
*  And I'm also calling on consumers to vote with their dollars. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=180.0s)]
*  So if Nike's not going to do right by your daughter, choose another brand. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=183.0s)]
*  Choose mine. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=187.0s)]
*  That's right. And they should. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=189.0s)]
*  By the way, if folks want to see that entire ad, where can they find it, Jennifer? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=191.0s)]
*  You could go to our YouTube channel, which is just xx-xyathletics on YouTube, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=194.0s)]
*  or go to our Instagram, which is xx-underscore-xy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=200.0s)]
*  We're up to something like 7 million views in just under two days since it launched. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=203.0s)]
*  And we rely on this kind of viral thing to get going, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=208.0s)]
*  because we keep getting banned from social media platforms. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=212.0s)]
*  So, you know, thanks to everyone for sharing the ad and passing it on and leaning in to buy the brand. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=215.0s)]
*  And I want to just say one other thing. We are in this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=221.0s)]
*  This is not a gimmick, standing up for women and girls and the protection of women's sports. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=223.0s)]
*  We make world-class product. I promise people will not be disappointed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=227.0s)]
*  You don't have to sacrifice quality, fit and style to go with a brand that represents your values. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=231.0s)]
*  Good for you. Good for you. xx-xy. Check it out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=236.0s)]
*  By the way, we reached out to Nike for a statement, and they did not immediately respond. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=239.0s)]
*  No surprise. Jennifer Say, thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=244.0s)]
*  Thank you, Jennifer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=246.0s)]
*  Thank you all for having me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=247.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_j039n7NMA&t=249.0s)]
