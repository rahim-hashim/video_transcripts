# ‘LONG TIME COMING’: Trump sees a surge in support among Native American voters
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o)
*  President-elect Trump's victory came in large part from a growing support of minorities, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=0.0s)]
*  and that included Native Americans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=5.72s)]
*  In fact, 17 Native American majority counties went red this election. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=8.16s)]
*  And get this, this number blew me away. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=12.68s)]
*  65% of Native Americans voted for Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=14.88s)]
*  Joining me now with his thoughts is Myron Lizer, former vice president of the Navajo [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=18.72s)]
*  Nation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=23.44s)]
*  Myron, so great to have you on today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=24.44s)]
*  I have Native American family and I can just attest anecdotally that people that always [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=27.08s)]
*  voted Democrat voted Republican and for Trump, you know, from their from their reservation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=32.48s)]
*  So it's fascinating to me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=38.36s)]
*  Why don't you lay out what you think was different in this election? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Why did Native Americans vote red? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=43.64s)]
*  I think it was a long time coming. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=47.04s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  And happy Veterans Day to all our veterans out there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=51.76s)]
*  We appreciate this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=53.64s)]
*  I think it was a long time coming. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=55.72s)]
*  Ever since 2016, there has been a movement to, you know, get more Native American voters [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=57.6s)]
*  out there to study the issues, be educated and to vote accordingly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=63.56s)]
*  And so this was a culmination, but certainly we're not done. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=68.16s)]
*  There's still a long ways to go. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=71.68s)]
*  We're not going to just let it all weigh in, you know, one and done and let it go. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=74.08s)]
*  We've got to work just like the Democrats do feverishly until the next election cycle. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=77.36s)]
*  So I think it was really just reflective of the outreach that was done. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=82.48s)]
*  We have a lot of people pitching in, not not only Navajo and Native Americans, but also [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=87.08s)]
*  non-Native people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=93.56s)]
*  It was just a time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  I think it was a culmination of the time, the issues, the problems in Indian country [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=96.92s)]
*  and the outreach. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=101.36s)]
*  So that's really how you see this play out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=102.44s)]
*  So the top issues for Native Americans, I imagine, obviously the economy, they're rural. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=105.32s)]
*  A lot of them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  So gasoline prices are a big deal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=111.44s)]
*  What else? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=114.0s)]
*  Oh, gosh, the economy is one. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=115.72s)]
*  I think the foreign conflicts, I think our Native American young ones, the people, it's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=117.88s)]
*  been shown in the past ever since our Navajo code talkers in World War II. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, our people would enlist early if there was a foreign conflict, a war. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=128.12s)]
*  Our people would readily defend the motherland here readily more than any other people group [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  ethnicity out there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  And so I think the foreign conflicts and the threats of the wars looming really activated [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=141.72000000000003s)]
*  our people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  We don't want our children to have to go to some faraway land and fight. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=147.56s)]
*  The economy definitely really is something that I think is really needing to be addressed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  High prices on food and gasoline. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=157.8s)]
*  Our elders can't afford those. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=159.96s)]
*  It's so long to travel to a grocery store from our homes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=162.28000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=166.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=166.68s)]
*  Can I ask you really quickly, how much of this had to do? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=167.56s)]
*  Obviously, the issues are so important, but how much did the personality of Donald Trump, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=169.88s)]
*  his persona, play with Native American populations and their willingness to trust him [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=174.27999999999997s)]
*  with this election? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  I think he's so different. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=183.88s)]
*  He's not a politician, per se. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=185.0s)]
*  We've had a lot of people do entertain candidates at any one time, any one election cycle, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=188.11999999999998s)]
*  to entertain the Native American vote. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=195.32s)]
*  But it's spot duty. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  I think only recently, as of the last five decades, the Democrats have really pinpointed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=198.68s)]
*  the Native American vote. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=205.24s)]
*  And I kind of challenge that, because I look around my reservation that I live on, Navajo [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=207.08s)]
*  Nation and some of the other nations that I went to visit while I was in office as the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=212.28s)]
*  vice president. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=217.0s)]
*  It's like we really need a lot of help. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  While using the federal term for our communities, disadvantaged communities, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  something's got to change. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  I think that really showed up this election as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=227.72s)]
*  And President Trump, again, he's not a politician. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=229.88s)]
*  He's a businessman and well-established in his own right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=234.04s)]
*  I think he brought a new, a fresh vibe, a fresh vision, so to speak. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=237.16s)]
*  I think Indian country could stand to learn about all of his methods, his tactics, and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=242.6s)]
*  carve out a niche opportunity for him to help Indian country. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=250.84s)]
*  I know we've got to overcome all the rhetoric. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  We've got to overcome all the divisive points and really look at the true substance of any [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=257.4s)]
*  one issue and find out if President Trump is the man for the hour. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=261.48s)]
*  Myron Lizer talking to us about one of the most surprising and fascinating aspects of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=266.6s)]
*  this election. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=272.2s)]
*  Indian country, as you call it, voting for Donald Trump by 64 percent. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=273.8s)]
*  Remarkable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  We'll see if there's some appointments from Native Americans in the administration to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=280.2s)]
*  follow. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  Myron, we'll be back in touch with you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=284.36s)]
*  Love talking to you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=288.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4HJOLqj6o&t=289.56s)]
