# Trump set for 'unpredictable' Oval Office meeting on Ukraine, tariffs
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y)
*  Alright today at the White House President Trump will host German Chancellor Frederick Murs as the two leaders are expected to discuss trade and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  the ongoing efforts to end the war between Russia and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=7.72s)]
*  Ukraine our senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us now with more hey Peter and a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=11.32s)]
*  Televised Oval Office meeting is going to be the first thing these leaders do today at 1130 when Chancellor Murs gets here [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=17.0s)]
*  So if President Trump decides that he wants to air out any dirty laundry about [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=23.6s)]
*  Germany and the things that they have been doing over the last couple years then [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=28.66s)]
*  The new Chancellor is not going to have a chance to talk him out of it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=33.18s)]
*  The way this White House operates basically is Trump and the new Chancellor Murs are going to get to know each other [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  Because they have no personal history live on camera [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=41.82s)]
*  the visiting leader is apparently going to try to talk Trump out of hiking tariffs on the EU next month and encourage him not to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Pull back from treaties that require the US to defend Europe like NATO and that follows an hour and 15 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=51.3s)]
*  minutes President Trump spent on the phone yesterday with Vladimir Putin who told the president a big [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=58.14s)]
*  Retaliation for the breathtaking drone strikes against Russian airfields is coming [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  That is why President Trump now says it was a good conversation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=68.26s)]
*  But not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  President Putin did say and very strongly that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields the defense secretary [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=74.78s)]
*  Pete Hague Seth is in Brussels right now at NATO headquarters some other world leaders are [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=81.98s)]
*  Reportedly bent out of shape that he skipped a meeting about helping Ukraine [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=87.38s)]
*  Francis McCrone is out there saying that the US wants to pull troops from Europe to stage them in the Pacific in case China acts up [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=92.1s)]
*  We'll see back to you. Well kind of interesting because we'd never know how those Oval Office meetings are going to go [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=100.46s)]
*  And the Chancellor comes in because he says I'm going to get to that 5% defense spending that should please Trump [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=107.1s)]
*  What about do you think that maybe the Chancellor goes public and says we do we need you mr [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=114.5s)]
*  President to give you or give you crane arms. How will that go? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=120.06s)]
*  Well, we'll see and you have to remember that just because President Trump doesn't have a personal history [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=124.58s)]
*  He has no beef with Chancellor Mers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=129.46s)]
*  But he had four years to think at to read the the International page of the New York Times or whatever [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  He's reading New York Post and and think about things that he wished our allies [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=137.68s)]
*  Were doing differently and so he has had a long time to think or possibly stew [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=144.12s)]
*  About things that the Germans have done over the last couple years [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=150.08s)]
*  He did not have the best relationship with Merkel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=152.36s)]
*  But he had an impactful relationship with Merkel there have been a couple Chancellor's since then and so it is entirely possible that the new [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=154.76s)]
*  Chancellor will come in and say [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay, you know we'll spend more, but you have to be there with us and I don't know how that'll go [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=162.84s)]
*  Will it be tough will be televised will they have a press conference? Yeah? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=168.82s)]
*  Alright, not like a formal press conference [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  But the two of them are gonna sit there and probably take questions for an hour [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=176.06s)]
*  The an hour to an hour and 15 minutes is generally how these things run now. Are you ready at 1130? Are you ready? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=179.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna go in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=185.66s)]
*  But I will be ready to stand here and listen and take notes on my phone [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=187.82s)]
*  Peter I tell you we're not talking about it now, but I just [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  We're playing your cuts of your questions to KJP and you must be just beside yourself at this hour [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=196.94s)]
*  I mean, how do you you need a tell the people at home if they're just waking up? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=202.94s)]
*  She she's just decided she's gonna be an independent not a Democrat anymore [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=206.42s)]
*  You know it's like I had a dream and I opened up the first page of her book about the broken White House and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=209.82s)]
*  the first sentence says [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=217.42s)]
*  Peter Ducey told me and I didn't listen to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=219.66s)]
*  The dream [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=226.38s)]
*  But she should dedicate the book to you and I know we're gonna talk about this next hour [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=227.58s)]
*  but the thing about this book is that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=231.34s)]
*  she [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=235.38s)]
*  towards the end after [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=236.82s)]
*  Before Biden dropped out after Biden dropped out. She would say that legitimate questions were misinformation and I told her once [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=238.98s)]
*  You can't just call something that you don't like [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=246.42s)]
*  Misinformation and so I don't know how she is going to square [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=250.54s)]
*  Being the public face of saying things that we now know [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=255.36s)]
*  We're not true about the president and about policies. I don't know how she's now gonna come out and say, you know what? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=259.72s)]
*  Just because I swore [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=266.96s)]
*  On camera that things were okay. Actually, here's what was really going on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  I just want you to get that we've seen it in other books. Oh, thank you. Yeah [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=275.92s)]
*  So just real quick on the Ukraine situation the president United States says Vladimir Putin is gonna respond. Why is he responding? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  He's been responding for three years. He's got over a million casualties [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=286.48s)]
*  The the Cranians are showing resourcefulness like we can only imagine almost from a movie [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  They're blowing up bridges and underwater explosions derailing trains. They're blowing they hit seven different military bases [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=294.88s)]
*  Not civilians and Vladimir Putin's gonna respond you've been responding by kidnapping children and bombing apartment complexes [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=302.12s)]
*  They are people should understand that the Ukrainians aren't perfect, but they're on the right side of things [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=310.12s)]
*  It is so [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=316.6s)]
*  Necessary for them to be successful. And by the way, though all the president came out and was critical [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=318.52s)]
*  He also cited Mark Tson's column yesterday calling on Congress to give him leverage with Putin by passing the Russian [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=323.44s)]
*  Sanctions so the president knows what he's doing. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucSesbHQR9Y&t=331.28s)]
