# DOGE volunteer: This made my jaw drop
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74)
*  Meanwhile, Elon Musk and the Doge team tackling fraud in Social Security, vowing to end schemes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=0.0s)]
*  that are draining taxpayer dollars. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=6.32s)]
*  As the saying goes, the wheels of justice turn slowly but surely. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=9.72s)]
*  And I think probably the person that stole 400,000 Social Security numbers, at least, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  maybe more, will be arrested hopefully this week. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  In 21, you see 270,000 people goes all the way to 2.1 million in 24. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=23.16s)]
*  These are non-citizens that are getting Social Security numbers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=29.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is a mind-blowing charge. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=33.96s)]
*  We went there to find fraud and we found this by accident. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=36.68s)]
*  Alright, Valor CEO and Doge volunteer Antonio Gracias, the guy you just saw, was just with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Musk in Wisconsin over the weekend. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=48.0s)]
*  He joins us from the North Lawn. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=49.8s)]
*  Antonio, good morning to you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Good morning Steve. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=52.84s)]
*  That's a draw-dropping number. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Where did all those people come from? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=56.0s)]
*  Well, it made my draw-drop too when I saw it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=58.6s)]
*  We were in Social Security looking for fraud, waste and abuse. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=62.2s)]
*  To do that, we actually looked at the enumeration system, the system by which people get numbers [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=65.8s)]
*  in America. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=69.4s)]
*  We found that there were just about five plus million of them that came to the country as [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=70.4s)]
*  illegals, were getting various forms of parole or allowed in the country, and they got through [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=75.56s)]
*  an automatic system, Social Security numbers, so they get into our benefit systems. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=80.4s)]
*  We tracked that through and found that they were on the benefit programs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=85.36s)]
*  Just because we were curious, we then looked to see if they were on the voter rolls. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  We found in a handful of cooperative states that there were thousands of them on the voter [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  rolls and that many of them had voted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=97.44s)]
*  That's crazy because you cannot vote in a federal election, but I think in certain local [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=101.8s)]
*  elections you can. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=107.24s)]
*  But once you get a Social Security number, that helps you do a lot of stuff. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=108.24s)]
*  I know, Antonio, part of this started with a program from, I think, 2017 that got started, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=113.12s)]
*  where if people came into the country and they were authorized to work, they would automatically [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  give them a number. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=124.2s)]
*  But Elon was talking a little bit about how 400,000 Social Security numbers were stolen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=126.28s)]
*  It was one person. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=133.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=134.2s)]
*  That's an ongoing investigation, so I don't know how much I can tell you, but we did find [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=136.84s)]
*  as we looked through the programs, a particular employee that had actually sent themselves [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=139.8s)]
*  Social Security numbers through their email for reasons we don't understand, but clearly [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=144.0s)]
*  nefarious. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=148.92s)]
*  Yeah, it does sound like it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=149.92s)]
*  So let me ask you this, Antonio. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=151.84s)]
*  Have you figured out, you saw these millions of people, non-citizens, on the Social Security [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=153.6s)]
*  rolls. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=159.32s)]
*  Did they get benefits? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=160.68s)]
*  Yes, we actually tracked them through the benefit programs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=162.16s)]
*  We found them in virtually all the benefit programs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=164.56s)]
*  And one statistic for you is we found 1.3 million of them on Medicare. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=167.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  So what's going to happen to those people? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=174.12s)]
*  Look, we've referred people that were registered to vote, which is a federal crime, and people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=176.08s)]
*  that voted to ICE, to DHS, and to the DOJ. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  They've committed to prosecute. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=186.28s)]
*  And I think it's super important to point out here that none of this would have happened [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=187.72s)]
*  without President Trump. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, President Trump had the courage to allow us to go across databases. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  He signed an executive order. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=195.0s)]
*  It's never been done before, where agencies could talk to each other and databases could [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=196.32s)]
*  talk to each other. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=200.64s)]
*  That allowed us to connect all this data to find these people across the system, across [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=201.76s)]
*  the benefit systems, all the way to the voting records. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=205.84s)]
*  It really took a lot of courage. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=208.72s)]
*  Antonio, you're a big shot business guy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=210.56s)]
*  You know what you're doing in your business. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=214.16s)]
*  When you went in, I can't think of the last time somebody essentially audited the Social [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=216.64s)]
*  Security Administration, aside from the federal government. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=223.2s)]
*  But they've got all these kind of antiquated, crazy rules. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=226.68s)]
*  I know you uncovered millions of people over the age of 120 and just recently kicked them [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=231.44s)]
*  off the rolls, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=237.4s)]
*  Yes, that's correct. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=238.88s)]
*  We did an audit of the entire system, the new ration system for Social Security. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=239.88s)]
*  And look, the reality is the people in the government know this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  There are many, many good people that are helping us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  We couldn't have found this stuff without them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=249.44s)]
*  We needed them to point us in the right direction and then we looked at the data. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=251.08s)]
*  So if you ask people the right questions, they will give you the answers and they want [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=253.88000000000002s)]
*  to help. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=257.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=258.36s)]
*  Antonio, exit question for you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=259.36s)]
*  Given all of the abuses you've already found and these people who are getting federal benefits [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=260.56s)]
*  who should not, do you have a price tag on how much you guys are saving the American [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=265.72s)]
*  taxpayer just from Social Security? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=271.64s)]
*  Look, it's in the billions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=274.6s)]
*  You saw the fraud on the phone lines itself. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=277.68s)]
*  That was about a billion and a half dollars. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  And I would guess at Social Security already we're north of 10 billion. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=282.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=284.96s)]
*  Well, the meter's running. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=285.96s)]
*  Antonio, thank you very much for joining us and thanks for volunteering. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnNVo8pOE74&t=286.96s)]
