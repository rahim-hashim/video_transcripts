# Tulsi Gabbard: Kamala Harris cannot run away from this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA)
*  In 2019, then-Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard knocked Kamala Harris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=0.0s)]
*  for a loop when she went after her record on the debate stage. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=9.0s)]
*  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=12.96s)]
*  violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=19.6s)]
*  I am proud of that work, and I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=23.52s)]
*  or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=29.32s)]
*  And now, as the former Democrat works to prepare former President Trump for tomorrow's 2024 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=35.0s)]
*  presidential debate, Politico says her shadow is looming over Harris. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=40.64s)]
*  Trump's transition team member Tulsi Gabbard joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=45.32s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=48.24s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  So a lot of people are asking, how is Donald Trump preparing? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  I know you've been brought in to help him with this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=54.6s)]
*  One of his campaign managers was on with us earlier and said that his tactics are different [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=57.6s)]
*  than Kamala Harris's in the way he preps. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=61.86s)]
*  Tell us what it's looking like for Donald Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=64.12s)]
*  Well, Kamala Harris is a politician in the worst sense of the word. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=66.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is not and has never been, nor will he ever be a typical politician. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=71.44s)]
*  And, you know, he is very well versed on the issues. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=76.8s)]
*  He is very well versed on Kamala Harris's record. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=80.0s)]
*  And he's talking about these issues almost every day as he's out with the American people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=83.62s)]
*  across the country, as he's doing interview after interview, town hall after town hall. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  And so for me, if there's anything that I can be helpful with, it really is just sharing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  the experience that I had with her on that debate stage. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  And the kinds of tactics I think she will try to use to perhaps get under his skin or [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  really to try to deflect away. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=107.9s)]
*  Her goal is going to be to deflect away from her disastrous record that has caused greater [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=109.38s)]
*  harm to the American people in so many ways and then shift to the new story, the new narrative [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=115.06s)]
*  that she wants to make voters believe and hopes that they will forget what she's already [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=122.66s)]
*  done over these last three and a half years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  So what's your advice to Donald Trump when she does try to deflect? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  He is looking forward to this debate and he is looking forward to focusing on Kamala Harris's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=134.5s)]
*  record. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=140.94s)]
*  And as you've said a few times this morning, Ainsley, since I've been watching, why hasn't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  she fixed the things that she is now saying are broken over the last three and a half [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=146.28s)]
*  years? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=150.5s)]
*  She is the incumbent candidate in this race. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=151.54s)]
*  She is vice president Kamala Harris, and she has had the opportunity over these three and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=154.1s)]
*  a half years, especially with Joe Biden, to have already brought about the kinds of changes [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=158.33999999999997s)]
*  that she is now promising that she will do in her quote unquote new way forward. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=163.42s)]
*  How can there be a new way forward when she is responsible for disastrous economic and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=168.61999999999998s)]
*  foreign policies, domestic and international policies that have been the hallmark of this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=173.7s)]
*  administration once again that have not helped the American people? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=178.7s)]
*  It's actually hurt the American people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I know that he said when he had the town hall with Sean Hannity, he said, you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=183.61999999999998s)]
*  might not like me, but look at my policies compared to Kamala Harris's policies. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  And there's a poll out this morning, New York Times, CNN poll saying that one third [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=192.94s)]
*  of American voters don't even know what she stands for. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=196.14s)]
*  So she's put some of her policies on her website. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=199.1s)]
*  What if Donald Trump, what if she nudges him to go personal? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=202.62s)]
*  Many people are telling Donald Trump, don't go personal. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=206.38s)]
*  Keep it on the policies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=209.72s)]
*  What's your advice for him there? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=210.9s)]
*  President Trump doesn't need my advice on this because he is very much focused on the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=214.3s)]
*  issues and how he will fix what Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have broken over these last [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=218.46s)]
*  three and a half years. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=224.1s)]
*  Donald Trump isn't running for president for himself. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=225.5s)]
*  He is running for president because he sees the risks and the dangers that we face as [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=228.06s)]
*  a country right now, specifically because of the Harris Biden administration. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=232.3s)]
*  And he wants to serve our country and serve the American people and actually fix what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=236.46s)]
*  they have broken. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=240.02s)]
*  The rules that he's agreed to and Kamala has now agreed to are the same rules that we saw [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  at the last presidential debate when he was debating Joe Biden. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=245.28s)]
*  It's muted mics, no studio audience. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  You can't take notes, just water and a piece of paper and a pen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=250.96s)]
*  So if you want to jot down thoughts in the middle of the debate, how does that fare for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Does that help him or hurt him? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  I think he did a fantastic job in his debate against Joe Biden. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=261.76s)]
*  Clearly, the results speak for themselves and he will do the same in this debate with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=266.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=271.48s)]
*  Vice President Harris should not be underestimated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=273.16s)]
*  Clearly, as some of the media reports have shown, they have been studying my debate with [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  her in 2019 and setting aside almost a week of solid debate prep with the lights and the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  stage and the stand ins and everything. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=288.32s)]
*  Donald Trump hasn't been doing that because he doesn't need to do it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=291.24s)]
*  He's been out speaking to the American people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=294.0s)]
*  She's taking this debate seriously. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=296.16s)]
*  She will come prepared with memorized lines, ready to recite and deliver them in what I [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=298.16s)]
*  think will be a very effective way. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=303.4s)]
*  However, she cannot run away from her record. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  President Trump looks forward to making sure the American people remember what she has [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=309.6s)]
*  done over these last three and a half years and how she had the opportunity to fix what's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=313.98s)]
*  broken but she's the one responsible for breaking it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=319.12s)]
*  He will come in as president and actually begin to fix those problems and get us back [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=322.8s)]
*  on track as a country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=326.9s)]
*  I know you were so calm during that debate with her. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=327.94s)]
*  That was the summer and then she dropped out of the race that next December. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=330.14s)]
*  It speaks volumes that you're helping Donald Trump after you ran as a Democrat and ran [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  against her. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=336.62s)]
*  Thank you so much, Tulsi, for coming on. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4aBaMZRXA&t=337.62s)]
