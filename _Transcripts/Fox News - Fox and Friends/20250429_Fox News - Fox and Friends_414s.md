# 'Shark Tank' star cautions Trump: The market doesn't want this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ)
*  White House press secretary Caroline Levitt and Treasury secretary Scott Besson will hold [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a briefing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=5.04s)]
*  The world will be watching as today marks the president's 100th day in office. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=6.04s)]
*  They'll be highlighting President Trump's major focus, cutting wasteful spending tariffs, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=10.16s)]
*  and his push to make America rich again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=14.6s)]
*  Guest O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=17.48s)]
*  Kevin, great to see you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=20.92s)]
*  Your thoughts, I know you've been a stalwart against China and the trade imbalance. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=22.56s)]
*  You want this thing solved. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=26.96s)]
*  What else do you want to see done or mentioned today? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=28.6s)]
*  Well, I've put the whole tariff thing in two baskets. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  The trading partners, which we've detailed quite a bit lately. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=34.36s)]
*  Everybody in the market wants to see one deal done. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=38.44s)]
*  I think India is the most interesting because it opens up the car market finally. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=40.68s)]
*  There's been 110% tariffs on U.S. car product going into India for a long time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  If we go to a reciprocal 10% or zero, that opens it up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  There's a lot of product we could sell in India. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=52.2s)]
*  We'd have a more balanced trade there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=55.36s)]
*  But the thing would be, it would signal to the market the deals are going to get done. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=57.0s)]
*  And I predict the market would go up a thousand points with an India signature whenever that happens. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=60.88s)]
*  China, different story. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=66.08s)]
*  It's not about tariffs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=68.12s)]
*  It's about IP theft, access to their legal system, trade disputes with the World Trade Organization. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=69.88s)]
*  Their companies listed on New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ are not compliant. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=75.08s)]
*  I have to pay millions in compliance fees. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  They pay nothing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=81.04s)]
*  They're not compliant with GAAP. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=82.04s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=83.32s)]
*  Let's solve that problem. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=84.56s)]
*  So if you look at the litany of issues with China, tariffs are just one thing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  So it's been a long time since any administration anywhere has taken on the Chinese. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=89.52s)]
*  They built their economy stealing IP. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  And I'm one of the guys they stole it from and I'm a little pissed. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=97.8s)]
*  So I'm done with that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=101.0s)]
*  I want it to stop. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=102.12s)]
*  Do you remember Lawrence went out to, where did you go? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=103.0s)]
*  Wisconsin? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=106.16s)]
*  You went to the steel mill and they kept saying regulations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=106.84s)]
*  We're tired of all these regulations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=109.84s)]
*  And Scott Bessett, he addressed that yesterday. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=111.6s)]
*  Listen to this sound bite and then we'll talk about it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  On the other side. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  We've got a three legged stool here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=117.72s)]
*  It's trade, it's tax, it's deregulation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=120.36s)]
*  President Trump has come out of the box roaring. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, this is something new for the American people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=126.2s)]
*  He's given one, two press conferences a day, an incredible level of transparency. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=128.68s)]
*  Contrast that with the previous administration, where the president, we're not quite sure [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=134.4s)]
*  who was running policy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=140.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=142.28s)]
*  Likely not president Biden. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=143.12s)]
*  And we are moving forward for the American people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=145.16s)]
*  And it's very, very exciting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=149.68s)]
*  We're going to continue to make the U.S. the best destination for capital in the world. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=151.88s)]
*  So, Kevin, trade, tax deregulation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=155.88s)]
*  Those are the focus. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=159.16s)]
*  When you deregulate, you stimulate capital because capital comes into the path of least [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=160.6s)]
*  resistance, particularly large projects. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=167.12s)]
*  One of the reasons sovereign wealth does not come is when they don't see the path to getting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=169.92s)]
*  a deal done. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  And so when you get a lot of red tape, particularly at the federal level, money just kind of stays [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  away. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=181.24s)]
*  So if you can erase the federal regulation, particularly on these large capex job creating [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=182.24s)]
*  projects, money will come. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=188.92s)]
*  And you know, the United States of America still attracts more than 50% of every dollar [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=190.88s)]
*  invested worldwide. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  And that is the American dream. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=196.2s)]
*  The number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the American dream [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=198.0s)]
*  because the American dream is the number one export of America. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=200.92s)]
*  It's not energy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=203.92s)]
*  It's not technology. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=204.92s)]
*  It's the American dream. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=205.92s)]
*  Which is the possibility you can do anything. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=206.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=208.56s)]
*  And so every president's mandate has to be does this advance the American dream and keep [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=209.56s)]
*  us number one in terms of attracting capital. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=213.64s)]
*  That's what Trump has to do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=216.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=217.36s)]
*  And I think so far he's done a good job. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=218.36s)]
*  You know, we talk to Kevin all the time via satellite and other modes of communication. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=219.76s)]
*  But it's your chance now to ask some questions. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=226.32s)]
*  Kevin right over there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=228.32s)]
*  Nina has a question for you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=229.72s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=231.88s)]
*  Hi, Kevin. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=232.88s)]
*  What I know the president's kind of putting the lean on the Fed chair to lower rates, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=233.88s)]
*  interest rates. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm a banker and I know a lot of people don't like bankers. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=241.4s)]
*  But what do you what do you feel about that? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=244.88s)]
*  Do you think you should keep doing that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  I still see people borrowing money. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=249.04s)]
*  We're still pushing first time home buyers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=251.28s)]
*  They're still borrowing money. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  We're still buying houses. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=254.6s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=256.2s)]
*  So first of all, I forgive you for being a banker. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=257.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  It's been a long career. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  It's been good to me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  The market wants an independent Fed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Every administration, every executive office has always job owned the Fed to lower rates. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=264.52s)]
*  The fact that the Fed remains independent makes capital markets feel better about investing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=269.08s)]
*  in treasuries in America. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=275.68s)]
*  And so, you know, I understand the pressure any Fed chair is under. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=277.04s)]
*  But the reason capital comes here is because of that check and balance between the executive [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=281.68s)]
*  and the Fed. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=287.04s)]
*  I don't want to see the Fed fired and either does the market. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=288.32s)]
*  Kevin, let's get Jennifer in real quickly before we go. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=291.48s)]
*  Jennifer, what's your question? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=294.0s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=295.0s)]
*  I just have a question regarding tariffs. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=296.0s)]
*  The income that we're receiving from the tariffs right now, how likely is it that they'll offset [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=300.08s)]
*  our federal income tax? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=307.76s)]
*  Highly unlikely. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=309.92s)]
*  You can't replace income tax with tariffs unless you're charging more than 20 percent. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=310.92s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=317.68s)]
*  It's inflationary. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=318.68s)]
*  Tariffs are short-term weapons to rebalance trade. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=320.16s)]
*  India's a great example. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=324.04s)]
*  They've had 110 percent tariffs on automotive going into India. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=325.04s)]
*  And now the Indians have come to the White House and said, okay, okay, okay, let's redo [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  We'll work out a deal. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  And if we end up with zero tariffs with India or 10 percent each way, that's a good thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  But tariffs in themselves will not solve the deficit because they just cause prices [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB9_3AvKKQ&t=339.16s)]
