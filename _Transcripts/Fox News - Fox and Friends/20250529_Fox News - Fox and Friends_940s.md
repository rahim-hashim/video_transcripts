# Bongino: FBI 'closing in on suspects' in Jan 6 pipe bomb case
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA)
*  All right, the FBI is now re-examining high interest cases that went unsolved in the Biden era. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=0.0s)]
*  That includes the 2021 DC pipe bombings, the 2022 leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=5.44s)]
*  and the cocaine that was found in the White House in 2023. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=12.0s)]
*  Here to discuss this and more is FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Dan, great to see you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=14.8s)]
*  Hey, Dan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=18.8s)]
*  I'm back. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=19.3s)]
*  Yeah, welcome back. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=19.8s)]
*  I'm back. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=20.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=20.8s)]
*  To see you in person. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=21.3s)]
*  Memories. I have so many good memories here. Great to see all of you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=21.8s)]
*  First off, before we get into specifics, what did you think the job was going to be like? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=24.72s)]
*  What is it like? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=28.64s)]
*  The biggest lifestyle change for me has been family-wise. I mean, we already went through [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=30.56s)]
*  this with my time in the Secret Service. But when the president called and asked if I would take [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=34.88s)]
*  the job, you can't tell your audience for years, go out and do stuff. Talk is cheap. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  And then when the opportunity comes to do stuff, I didn't mean me. I meant you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  You're a fraud. I mean, you don't sound like a fraud. You are one. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  So it was a lot. It's been tough on the family. People ask me all the time, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=53.84s)]
*  you know, do you like it? I say, no, I don't. But the president asked me to do this to like it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Nobody likes going into an organization like that and having to change things and make big, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=66.24s)]
*  bold changes. But I was at one of our facilities yesterday down in Winchester, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=71.36s)]
*  and a woman who worked there very nice said, I used to watch your show. I miss you. I said, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=76.0s)]
*  you know, I miss me too. Part of you dies a little bit when you see all this stuff from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=80.4s)]
*  behind the scenes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=86.56s)]
*  You're doing this for country. So we appreciate that. And we thank you. And we're excited [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=87.44s)]
*  to find out to roll back the curtain and find out what's deep in the FBI. We have so many [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=91.84s)]
*  questions about those three cases we just mentioned. Y'all are doing a deep dive into this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=98.32s)]
*  What's the latest on those investigations? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=102.4s)]
*  So the moment cash and I swore in, we realized that the first thing we had to do is rebuild [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=104.4s)]
*  public trust. This is your FBI. It's not mine. I tell the employees every day, you don't own it, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=110.64s)]
*  you don't own it. I don't own it. It's like being the center fielder for the Yankees. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=115.36s)]
*  That'll live with you forever, but you don't own the Yankees. It's a proud franchise. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=118.8s)]
*  The place has taken a reputational hit. There is zero question about it. There were a lot of bad [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=122.88s)]
*  actors, one of them still out there causing us all kinds of trouble. So we had to fix it and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=127.6s)]
*  rebuild public trust. One of the ways to do it is these cases of significant public interest [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=133.52s)]
*  that matter. You know, we had two pipe bombs planted on January 6th. I mean, we were told by [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=137.76s)]
*  partisan actors out there, this was the insurrection, the world was going to fall apart [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=143.92s)]
*  and no one seemed to show any interest in this case. The second we got in, I put a team on it [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  and I said, I want answers on this. And I'm pretty confident that we're closing in on some suspects. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=152.56s)]
*  The reason, by the way, I use social media with these cases, I'm trying to communicate on social [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  media is nothing's by accident, guys. I do nothing by accident. Every time I put a tweet out on it, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=164.56s)]
*  we get tips. We got a fascinating tip on one of these cases, one of the three. I don't want to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=169.76s)]
*  say which one, but I'm pretty confident that we're going to close out one of them, hopefully [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  shortly. And then the cocaine in the White House, you know, I saw someone on social media, which is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=179.76s)]
*  fine. Everybody's entitled to an opinion. We work for you. But said, I don't care about the case. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=183.6s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I was a Secret Service agent. A potentially hazardous material made its way into [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=187.04s)]
*  the White House. Nobody seems to know how it got there and nobody seemed to investigate it fully. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, what planet do we live on where that's not a public interest? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  You're faced with this interesting thing. I've known you since I was a kid. And I know your [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=201.68s)]
*  instinct is to swing back. But you promise that you weren't going to do that. You promise that you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=206.88s)]
*  were going to get rid of the partisanship and you were going to go back to being a law enforcement [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=210.88s)]
*  officer. You went in there and there were some cases that were closed or still open that a lot [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  of the public felt a little sketchy about. The first assassination attempt against President [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=223.36s)]
*  Donald Trump. It's like, is he really the guy? What happened with Epstein? Can you say with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  confidence as a lot of people used to be their guy when it comes to podcasts appearing on Fox News, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  but now as a law enforcement officer, can you say we have all the information? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=239.52s)]
*  Well, I'm never going to say we have all of it. And people ask me all the time, are these cases [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=244.4s)]
*  closed? And whether they're closed administratively is irrelevant. If new tips come in, we're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=248.56s)]
*  absolutely going to follow them. And that's why I always put out, if you have additional information, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  please let us know. Those two cases obviously are of significant public interest. I'm just telling [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  you what we see in the file. I am, I just want to be crystal clear on this. I am not asking anyone [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=261.84s)]
*  to believe me. I'm telling you what's there and what isn't. Right. There is nothing in the file [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  at this point on the Epstein case. And there's going to be a disclosure on this coming shortly. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=273.52s)]
*  We are working through some, there is video. That is something the public does not know. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=278.96s)]
*  There's video of him killing himself. No, no, not, not the actual act, but there, the entire [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  MCC bay, it was only one camera. There were other, there's video that when you look at the video and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=290.08s)]
*  we will release, that's what's taken a while on this. We are working on cleaning it up to make [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  sure you have an enhanced and we're going to give the original. So you don't think there were any [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=300.24s)]
*  shenanigans. You're going to see, there's no one there but him. Right. There's just nobody there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=303.92s)]
*  So I say to people, if you have a tip, let us know, but there's no DNA, there's no audio, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=308.16s)]
*  there's no fingerprints, there's no suspects, there's no accomplices, there's no tips. There [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=313.6s)]
*  is nothing. If you have it, I'm happy to see it. There's video clear as day. He's the only person [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  in there and the only person coming out. You can see it. So there's three cases that you're looking [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=323.44s)]
*  at the two DC by pipe bombings, the Supreme court leak on the Dops decision and the cocaine [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=327.52s)]
*  in the white house. You say one of them within a day or two, we're going to have a major break. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=332.24s)]
*  Well, we got the, we've got a good tip this morning. We're going to run it out. We're not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=337.28s)]
*  going to be able to make that public obviously right away. Cause we have to make sure. And you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  know, we have to go all the proper steps, what I don't want to do ever. And I've said this before, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, it's not an excuse. I can't say to the public enough. I put it in my tweets all the time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=350.56s)]
*  I'm not asking you to trust me. Nothing drives me crazy. And people go, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=355.44000000000005s)]
*  they're asking us to trust the plan. I am absolutely not read my tweets. I don't want you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  to trust me. I don't be nice. I want all I care about his results. So let's talk about what the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  president wants. He clearly wants a result. When he told Brett bear on the assassination temp, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=369.12s)]
*  he's got questions on the first one. Watch. There's a lot of frustration that we still [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=373.44000000000005s)]
*  don't know about that shooter in Butler and we don't have to know about his communications. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=380.4s)]
*  Will we get transparency? I thought it was strange. You know, the one guy had 18 cell phones. Okay. I [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=384.64s)]
*  have a lot of cell phones, but I have like two, you know, I called it a lot. And I think I probably [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=389.68s)]
*  make more calls than him. They live outside of Butler in a little place. Where did they get this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=395.12s)]
*  lawyer that would represent IBM and would represent Exxon Mobil. You're the president. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=400.96s)]
*  Secret service. They tell me it's fine, but it's a little hard to believe to be honest with you. Okay. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=407.12s)]
*  It's a little bit hard to believe as I get that throbbing feeling. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=416.0s)]
*  So then the question is that a lot of people have wondered is did this kid have helped? He could not [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  have pulled it off by himself. Was there a foreign actor? Did someone provide him with the weapons? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  Were there chatter online? Well, let's be clear. There are two separate parallel tracks here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=429.92s)]
*  Foreign actors targeting people in the United States. And there's it's not just the president's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=435.92s)]
*  others. That is a very real track. The question is, do they intersect the case file now, which by the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  way, we are going to make another public release on this coming up. We're just kind of finishing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  up the product now to make sure it's tight and put together. You're going to see a lot of what [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=452.32s)]
*  you've heard about online does not exist in the case file. I'm not telling you information may [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=457.04s)]
*  not surface later. We do the we do the PDB, the president's daily brief. We get the same brief, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=461.92s)]
*  me and cash every morning. We have worn people out telling them if there's something there we [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=466.0s)]
*  want to find. They have shaken every tree on this. You mean you talk to his classmates, you talk to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=472.16s)]
*  his family, you've talked to everyone because they have a family. They burn the body cremated [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  and they clean the whole house out. Yeah. And here's the thing. There are like with the Epstein [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=480.16s)]
*  case, for example, we have a number of significantly odd abnormalities that would make a normal person [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=485.52s)]
*  go, huh, what if Lawrence is near his bank at four o'clock and the bank gets robbed, but we know [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  Lawrence reported to work afterwards as an alibi. The fact that the bank was robbed, it's a fact [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=496.96s)]
*  that Lawrence was there, but it's not evidence that Lawrence committed the crime. Things really, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  really bad things happened in this case. But when you see the report we're going to release, you'll [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=507.68s)]
*  see that not everything you've been told is true. But the president is not wrong at all. I mean, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=511.84s)]
*  he's entirely, hey, who's shot in the head? He was shot in the head, got up and screaming, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=517.12s)]
*  fight, fight. Of course he's going to whine. That's right. Answers. But that's our responsibility. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=520.72s)]
*  And nothing's ever closed though. If new evidence services, we'll be sure to get it out. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=524.0s)]
*  It was just things that were strange. The slope roof thing, you know, the guy was on his bicycle [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  roaming around, never caught, never seen. Let's talk about something that's been in the news this [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=532.0s)]
*  morning. And that is Cash Patel talking about how when James Cummings was on the beach and he [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=536.8s)]
*  posted that social media, 8647, he claims that he just happened to walk up along the beach and they [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=541.44s)]
*  saw the shells, he and his wife, and he put it on social media, says he thought it was innocent. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=548.48s)]
*  He was the director of the FBI, but thought it was innocent. He knows what 86 means. Then Cash [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  Patel said, now we have all these copycats and now y'all are having to pull resources from all [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=558.24s)]
*  these serious crimes, terrorists, gang related individuals, drug traffickers, and people who are [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  abusing children. You're pulling them off to go research these copycats because we can't afford [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=570.64s)]
*  another assassination attempt. I gotta tell you of all the things that have surprised me in the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=575.12s)]
*  close to now three months I've been here is the depravity of Jim Comey. This man is a disgrace [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=580.96s)]
*  to the badge, the FBI, and the country. What he's doing right now, one, going out and taking shots [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=587.84s)]
*  at Cash. Cash isn't belong, Cash was the chief of staff at the department of, Cash is a patriot. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=594.32s)]
*  Cash has served in numerous high level roles, taking personal shots while you're on the beach, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=602.0s)]
*  implying a threat towards the president, blaming your wife about it. And let me just add about [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=606.88s)]
*  James Comey, you know, Saint Comey, who walks around there moralizing to everyone how wonderful [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=612.0s)]
*  the human being is. What you said is absolutely accurate. We have wasted countless man hours now [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  running out tips to our tip line about people putting 86 47 because of Jim Comey because he [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=623.5200000000001s)]
*  cannot control himself and his emotions. He is a child. He is a big child. And let me tell you one [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=630.48s)]
*  more thing. Jim Comey, who wants you to, Jim Comey taking a shot at the president. Oh look at me, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=636.0s)]
*  I'm such a victim, the president's going after me. He's making a ton of money on this book. The only [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=641.2800000000001s)]
*  person that got prosecuted was the president. Jim Comey, we're finding stuff even now. Wait till [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=645.7600000000001s)]
*  you read the stuff that's coming out. But does he still have loyalists in the building? Because [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=652.0s)]
*  when I hear the FBI director saying you guys are finding boxes that are hidden. Okay, how does that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=656.4s)]
*  happen in the bureau? Well, we were there a couple of weeks and luckily there are a lot of people up [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=663.84s)]
*  there who grabbed us by the arm the minute we came in and said, thank you for being here. You know, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=671.12s)]
*  we need to talk. There are people there who are really horrified at what happened. And there was [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=676.08s)]
*  a room and we found stuff, a lot of stuff. A hidden room. I wouldn't call it hidden but hidden from us [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=682.32s)]
*  at least and not mentioned to us. And then we found stuff in there and a lot of it's from the Comey [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  era and we are working our damn this right now to declassify. And just so you know, because I get [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=694.96s)]
*  the public, I totally understand people saying, well do it now. The process is not all the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  information is ours to declassify. Some of the other intelligence agencies, it's not, we literally [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=705.12s)]
*  can't do it. Once that gets done and that gets out there and you read some of the stuff we found, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=709.84s)]
*  that by the way was not processed through the normal procedure, digitizing it, putting in FBI records. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  We found it in bags hiding under Jim Comey's FBI. You're going to be stunned. The shells on the beach. Can you not [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=720.0s)]
*  talk to social media and say, y'all take this down. If you see anyone posting this, take it down. It's [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=725.84s)]
*  a threat to the president's life. Second thing, can you arrest people that post these like Comey? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=729.92s)]
*  We make arrest decisions based on an interaction with the Department of Justice. We're the FBI, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  Federal Bureau of Investigation, not prosecution. The problem is a lot of these cases haven't been a [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=740.72s)]
*  Secret Service agent is you're going to prove intent and here's what you don't want. You say you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  arrest them and he goes, there's not a magistrate that's going to, and the guy walks out of court [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=750.24s)]
*  doing a victory. You got to build the right case. You have to build a case. You need to build probable [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=754.08s)]
*  cause. I don't want to do what the left did, which is jump the gun. I mean then you have a situation [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=757.84s)]
*  like the prior deputy director prior to being Andrew McCabe who goes back, you know, files a [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=762.08s)]
*  lawsuit. You know, this guy was engaged in one of the biggest scandals in American history. He got [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  $200,000 I believe and his pension. You have to do this the right way. What about social media? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=774.32s)]
*  And he also got a network contract. So he's an expert commenting on you. Yeah, they're real victims. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=779.36s)]
*  Well listen, as Lawrence said before, it's difficult for me to not be able to respond [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  like I used to, but there'll be a day. There'll be a day. I'll be back one day and I'm going to be [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=791.68s)]
*  sure to answer all that stuff. But that's not my job now. My job now is to put aside my partisan [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=798.0s)]
*  interests and to responsibly handle the deputy director of the FBI. You got to remember, Brian, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=805.68s)]
*  nothing that gets to our desk, me or cash, is a five or a six problem. Everything's a 10. If it's [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=810.2399999999999s)]
*  a nine, someone else fixed it. We didn't even get a chance to talk about the laptop that the FBI held [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=815.68s)]
*  onto to make sure it wasn't a factor in the election. Well, there's been, that's another [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=819.2s)]
*  thing I wanted to address. You know, we can't publicly talk about HR matters. We just can't. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=823.44s)]
*  It's illegal. Yeah, you can't do it. But anyone out there who thinks we have not taken [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=829.12s)]
*  appropriate action against political actors, they're just making that up. We can't go out [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=835.36s)]
*  and advertise this stuff, but if you think we're allowing partisanship to infiltrate the FBI and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=842.6400000000001s)]
*  just let all that bad stuff happen, you're really just making, I don't know why you're doing it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=847.68s)]
*  Maybe you're trying to break up, you know, divorce us from the people and breed mistrust, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=852.0s)]
*  but that is not what's happening. I don't know what people think me and cash are doing all day. I [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=857.12s)]
*  gave up everything for this. I mean, you know, my wife is struggling and I'm not a victim. I'm not [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  Jim Comey. It's fine. I did this and I'm proud I did it. But if you think we're there for tea and [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  crumpets, well, I mean, cash is there all day. We share, our offices are linked. He turns on the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=872.88s)]
*  faucet. I hear it. He's there at, he gets in like six o'clock in the morning. He doesn't leave till [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=878.72s)]
*  seven at night. You know, I'm in there at seven thirty in the morning. You know, he uses the gym. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=883.28s)]
*  I work out in my apartment, but I stare at these four walls all day in D.C. You know, by myself, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=888.4s)]
*  divorced from my wife, not divorced, but I mean, separated divorced. And it's hard. I mean, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=894.32s)]
*  you know, we love each other and it's hard to be apart. But you're doing some great work. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=898.8s)]
*  The FBI, you move in buildings, there's a lot of change. I just got one more thing. I just don't. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=902.88s)]
*  I'm not asking anyone to trust me. Trust is for fools. Just wait for the results. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=907.2s)]
*  Just that's all I'm asking. Don't trust me. Trust the people. Too many actors in government have [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=913.36s)]
*  asked you to trust them and screwed you in the past. We're not doing that. Speed. You don't need [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=917.76s)]
*  speed in this. You need to do it right. Smooth is fast. Thanks, Dan. Great to see you. Great to see you. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=921.68s)]
*  I didn't hurt you, did I? No, he's still a little bit. OK, yeah. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLszvIOPSdA&t=925.92s)]
