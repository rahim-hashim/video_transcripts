# 'He REALLY messed up': Biden under fire for 'garbage' remark
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE)
*  All right. Meanwhile, before the shirt talk, you heard Lawrence talking about it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House now in damage control mode after President Biden [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=5.04s)]
*  inexplicably went on TV and called Trump supporters. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=9.72s)]
*  It sure sounds like garbage during a campaign call last night. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=14.26s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson joins us live from the White House. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=17.22s)]
*  Say Lucas. Well, good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=19.48s)]
*  It was just last week that President Biden said he wanted to lock Donald Trump up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=21.64s)]
*  Now he said the following last night. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=25.92s)]
*  I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know or Puerto Rico, where I'm in my home state of Delaware. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=27.96s)]
*  They're good, decent, honorable people. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=35.8s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters, his his demonization seen as unconscionable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=38.04s)]
*  A White House spokesman attempted to clarify Biden's remarks, saying, quote, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=45.72s)]
*  the president referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as, quote, garbage [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=50.0s)]
*  until Biden's comments, which critics say harkens back to Hillary Clinton's deplorables comment [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=55.68s)]
*  that night was supposed to belong to his vice president, Kamala Harris. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=60.18s)]
*  Her campaign says 75000 people packed the ellipse here in the nation's capital to listen to Harris's closing argument. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=63.48s)]
*  Now, before Biden's remarks, there was a lot of focus on that comedian who spoke at the garden at Trump's rally, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=70.4s)]
*  who made what some considered a crude remark about Puerto Rico. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=75.64s)]
*  Now it's Biden's comments that last night that many Trump supporters are finding offensive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=79.16s)]
*  Of course, President Biden has not campaigned with his vice president at a rally since Labor Day, and there's no plans for him to do so. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=84.44s)]
*  Now, Senator Tom Cotton says he wants Biden to apologize to Harris. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=90.72s)]
*  He wants Harris to condemn those comments, guys. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=95.64s)]
*  Lucas, I've got a question for you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=98.92s)]
*  So last night, Kamala Harris was on the ellipse, which is the park to the side of the White House. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  You could see the White House in the background. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=106.68s)]
*  If Joe Biden looked out his window, he would see that party with tens of thousands of people that he was not invited to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  Do you do people think that that's why he got on the horn and started talking to CNN and then made this gigantic mess less than a week before the election? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=115.72s)]
*  What appears that this event was already planned, Steve, but you're right to point out the numbers of people came here to the ellipse, which is just a few hundred yards away. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=125.56s)]
*  There's 75000 people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=133.84s)]
*  Remember, in Houston over the weekend, 30,000 packed that arena to hear Beyonce and the vice president speak. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Biden spoke at a rally in Pittsburgh. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  It was just union members. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=145.4s)]
*  There's only about 100 people that attended that Wednesday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. You just wonder why he was doing anything to take any spotlight away from the vice president when she needed the spotlight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=149.28s)]
*  And now you know, he really messed up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=156.8s)]
*  Lucas, thanks so much. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=159.4s)]
*  Thank you, Lucas. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=160.56s)]
*  So President Trump was on stage with Marco Rubio. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  They were at an event in Allentown, Pennsylvania, at a rally, and Marco Rubio informed him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=165.0s)]
*  Breaking news. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  This is what Joe Biden just said about your supporters. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=171.08s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=174.88s)]
*  Well, I wasn't going to say anything, but I have breaking news for you, Mr. President. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=176.52s)]
*  You may not have heard this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=179.84s)]
*  Just moments ago, Joe Biden stated that our supporters are garbage. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=180.68s)]
*  He's talking about the Border Patrol. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=188.88s)]
*  He's talking about nurses. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=191.04s)]
*  He's talking about teachers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=192.6s)]
*  He's talking about everyday Americans who love their country and want to dream big again and support you, Mr. President. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  And I hope their campaign is about to apologize for what Joe Biden just said. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=199.92s)]
*  We are not garbage. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=204.32s)]
*  We are patriots who love America. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  And thank you for running, Mr. President. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=207.16s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=209.48s)]
*  Remember Hillary, she said deplorable and then she said irredeemable. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=210.76s)]
*  Right. But she said deplorable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  That didn't work out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=216.92s)]
*  Garbage, I think, is worse, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  It's not helpful to the Harris campaign. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=220.44s)]
*  One of the spins is they said, we just want to put an apostrophe. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=222.8s)]
*  We want to fix it by putting an apostrophe after the S in the sentence to make it make sense. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know how that makes sense. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  After what S? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  After garbage. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=234.44s)]
*  It was because he said the only garbage I see floating out there are his supporters. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=235.44s)]
*  Supporters. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=240.44s)]
*  Supporters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah. So, yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=241.68s)]
*  So they put out an official statement right after. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, this is this is their spin. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  They said we the the damage control statement then added added an apostrophe to the word [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=250.0s)]
*  supporters to imply that Biden was only referring to one person. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=256.0s)]
*  And that's the comedian, Tony Ingecliffe, who made it to him, made the joke about Puerto [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=259.72s)]
*  Rico. Well, this is what Joe Biden. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=263.68s)]
*  That's a great spin. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  What Joe Biden did last night is exactly what Joe Biden did last night is exactly why the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=267.32s)]
*  campaign of Kamala Harris does not want to campaign with him because he should give him [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=273.16s)]
*  another chance. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=277.16s)]
*  He is unpopular and he is undisciplined and he has made a gigantic mess. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=277.8s)]
*  He's a ranger. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Did they even talk, though? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=283.92s)]
*  Isn't this the second time we've talked about how he's doing an interview while she has a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=285.12s)]
*  big event? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=289.56s)]
*  Remember, he went and took over the press conference in the press room while she's having [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  an event and everyone's had to switch away to the president. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=294.68s)]
*  But y'all, this is what they think of middle America. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=297.16s)]
*  This is what they think of the South. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=300.32s)]
*  Deplorable, smelly Walmart shoppers. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=301.8s)]
*  Remember when Barack Obama was an officer running and he said he was caught on a hot [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=303.88s)]
*  mic talking about Bibles and guns? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=309.32s)]
*  That's what the middle America got in guns. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=312.24s)]
*  Exactly. That's what they think of all of us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=314.68s)]
*  These are these coastal elites that, you know, live in their ivory towers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=317.6s)]
*  They're all politicians. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=322.68s)]
*  They make millions of dollars. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=324.0s)]
*  They call in the Hollywood A-listers. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=325.2s)]
*  And that's what they think of middle America. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=326.76s)]
*  You might be able to get away with that by criticizing Jill Stein supporters, both of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=328.44s)]
*  them, but you can't do that to 74 million people minimum. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=332.84s)]
*  So that's why I'm sure when those doors close, they cannot figure out how not only that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=337.0s)]
*  Joe that Donald Trump may win, but they even got the nomination. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=342.28s)]
*  They must sit there and go, what are they not seeing about what we're seeing? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=347.12s)]
*  They're flabbergasted. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=350.88s)]
*  Speaking of Jill Stein, it turns out yesterday, the U.S. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  Supreme Court refused to take R.F.K. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=354.96s)]
*  Jr. off the ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan, which is not helpful for Donald Trump because [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=356.96s)]
*  he would want his name off R.F.K. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=362.76s)]
*  very disappointed. But the Supreme Court not going to budge. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=366.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Biden stole the spotlight last night in the race. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  He dropped out over this comment about Trump supporters. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=372.52s)]
*  It sounds like I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know or Puerto Rico, where I'm in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  my home state of Delaware. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=382.36s)]
*  They're good, decent, honorable people. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=383.96s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=386.2s)]
*  His his demonization is seen as unconscionable. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=389.52s)]
*  Kind of a mess. Fox and Friends co-host Lawrence Jones is joined by U.S. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=394.24s)]
*  Senate candidate Dave McCormick, the Republican in the battleground of Pennsylvania, right [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=398.32s)]
*  there at that diner in Gap, P.A. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=403.0s)]
*  Guys, good morning. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=404.64s)]
*  Hey, good morning, Steve. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  We got David in here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=408.4s)]
*  We just got to get your reaction to the latest comments. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=409.96s)]
*  The president was supposed to be watching Kamala Harris's speech, just so that's what he [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=413.48s)]
*  told us. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=417.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, we learned that he was on a live stream in front of a laptop and he called [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump supporters garbage. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=422.76000000000005s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=423.8s)]
*  Yeah, listen, any time you call half of Americans garbage because half the population [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=424.6s)]
*  supporting President Trump, I think this is the kind of divisive rhetoric that we need [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  to get out of politics. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  I think it's terribly polarizing. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  And so not only is President Biden, Kamala Harris and Bob Casey had policies that have [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=436.92s)]
*  hurt more than half of Americans with skyrocketing prices, the fentanyl crisis. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  Now they're actually showing disrespect for him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=445.72s)]
*  So I hope the president will apologize for that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=447.48s)]
*  And we need to get that kind of horrible rhetoric. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  I think it shows how they really feel about people that support President Trump. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=453.6s)]
*  You got a bright coalition of support. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  You got some independent voters. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=459.68s)]
*  You got the former president, Donald Trump, supporting you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  Nikki Haley, who challenged the former president, is going to be on the ground campaigning [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  with you. Why does that matter? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  Bringing everyone for this race? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=470.36s)]
*  Well, listen, I'm trying to build a coalition. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=473.68s)]
*  President Trump's been here many times and he's been a very big supporter. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  But I've got to build a coalition that is 50 percent plus one. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=479.12s)]
*  And that includes Republicans that are on the fence, independents, conservative [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=482.88s)]
*  Democrats. And these problems are not Republican problems. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=486.44s)]
*  The wide open border, skyrocketing prices, the war on fossil fuels. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=490.56s)]
*  These affect all Pennsylvanians. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=495.08000000000004s)]
*  And we need to have a center that's going to fight for that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=497.2s)]
*  Senator Casey has been a career politician. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=499.04s)]
*  He's been weak. He's voted for all these liberal policies that are really taking our [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=501.04s)]
*  country in the wrong direction. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=505.0s)]
*  And I'm someone who's an outsider and I got to build a coalition that's important. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=506.76s)]
*  Your race is now a toss, but your opponent is trying to find some way to link himself [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=510.44s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=516.4s)]
*  To President Trump. I mean, this is the this is you know, panic is setting in at Casey [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=517.12s)]
*  headquarters because he's not only saying these outrageous lies and his attack ads, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=521.6s)]
*  he's now running commercials with him lining up to President Trump, who says he can't [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=525.92s)]
*  remember what Bob Casey looks like. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=530.16s)]
*  So listen, we're going to win this election. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=532.0400000000001s)]
*  It's critical that we get every single vote out there with the mail in the request for [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  mail in ballots is gone. We got to get people out to the polls and we're going to make a [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=540.0s)]
*  difference and win this election because people are rising up and they want to get their [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=543.64s)]
*  country moving in the right direction. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=547.64s)]
*  Again, there's a lot of people that are excited about sending another door kicker to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=549.0s)]
*  kick down the walls of Washington as well. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=553.36s)]
*  Let's talk with some of the folks here because I think that's important as well. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=555.84s)]
*  I think we got Tyler right here. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=559.12s)]
*  So, Tyler, what is your question for Dan? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, sir, thank you so much for coming to speak to voters today. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=563.24s)]
*  We certainly appreciate it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  I'd like to hear a little bit more about your solutions for the fentanyl crisis coming [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=566.88s)]
*  across our southern border and how we can start helping millions of Americans. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=570.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is a tragedy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=574.76s)]
*  We lost 4000 Pennsylvanians last year from fentanyl. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=576.0s)]
*  I've sat down with fentanyl families. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=579.48s)]
*  It's the most heartbreaking thing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=581.24s)]
*  They've lost their children and most of them didn't even know they were taking fentanyl. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=583.12s)]
*  And it comes across the wide open borders that President Biden, Kamala Harris and Bob [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=586.08s)]
*  Casey have allowed. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=590.64s)]
*  They've supported sanctuary cities. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  Day one in the Senate, we need to finish the wall. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=593.6s)]
*  We need to fund the Border Patrol. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=596.72s)]
*  And I think we need to designate these cartels as terrorist organizations and go across [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  the border with our drones, with our special operations and destroy the manufacturing, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=603.64s)]
*  destroy the distribution. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=608.48s)]
*  This is a war on our communities. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=609.8000000000001s)]
*  We have to treat it seriously. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  We've got to reduce demand and other things, but we've got to reduce the supply. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's honestly our leadership has failed us on this. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=617.16s)]
*  We need to take it more seriously and fix it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=620.5999999999999s)]
*  Sir, that's important for a lot of Americans. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  Let's go to my friend right here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=625.8399999999999s)]
*  What's your name again? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=627.28s)]
*  Angie. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=628.04s)]
*  And we got Angie. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=628.76s)]
*  What's your question for Dave? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=629.88s)]
*  Hey, Dave. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  I just want to know what your take is on all this rhetoric. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=631.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, we were called deplorables in the past. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=634.76s)]
*  Last night, the president referred to us as garbage. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=636.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm a medical-ass American. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't get fancy nails. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  I clean houses. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=643.52s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=645.0s)]
*  I just said the same thing. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=646.88s)]
*  It's beneath the president of the United States or commander in chief, Bob Casey's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=647.84s)]
*  best friend to refer to half of Americans as garbage. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=652.12s)]
*  You know, listen, we need to be above it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=655.72s)]
*  We need to recognize that we need leadership. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=657.04s)]
*  We need common sense policies. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=660.48s)]
*  That's what I'm running on. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=661.88s)]
*  And I recognize that on day one is in the Senate. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=664.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to represent every single Pennsylvania. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=666.88s)]
*  I want to. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=668.92s)]
*  Democrats, Republicans, independents. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=669.88s)]
*  This is about leadership. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=672.16s)]
*  That was a terrible comment, a disgraceful comment. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=673.16s)]
*  And it reminds me of Hillary Clinton talking about the deplorables. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=676.68s)]
*  That can't be what they think of half of America. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=680.68s)]
*  It's an awful thing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=683.36s)]
*  And I hope the president apologizes and takes it back. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=684.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=688.04s)]
*  We've got one more quick question. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=688.64s)]
*  All right, ma'am, what's your name? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=690.1999999999999s)]
*  Jenna. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  What's your question for Dave? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=691.9599999999999s)]
*  So it's increasingly harder for young people of my generation to be able to raise [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  families. So what can you do to make home ownership and childcare more affordable? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=698.6s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think it's. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=702.76s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=705.8s)]
*  I think it's I think it's a direct result of the price inflation, the skyrocketing [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=706.8s)]
*  prices we have under Biden, Harris and Bob Casey. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  Bob Casey voted 98 percent of the time for all these spending bills. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=715.76s)]
*  We've got to make it easier to have children. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=719.68s)]
*  So President Trump in his 2017 tax plan had a tax child tax credit. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  I would triple the size of that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=727.0799999999999s)]
*  So that needs to be much more significant. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=729.24s)]
*  We need to have child care, care tax credit. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=730.64s)]
*  And one of the things I propose is a fertility treatment, IVF tax credit, because [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=733.12s)]
*  fertility treatment is so expensive. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=738.36s)]
*  Most Americans can't afford it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=741.04s)]
*  And yet, and if they can't afford it, they can't experience the joy of of children. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=743.24s)]
*  When I was a CEO, I made sure every single employee had access to IVF. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=747.72s)]
*  We need to do that for all Americans having the joy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=752.28s)]
*  Now, listen, I have six daughters. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=754.76s)]
*  So the joy of parenting, I want to make sure every every single Pennsylvania can have [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=755.9599999999999s)]
*  that who wants it. Thank you. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=708tYqr93KE&t=759.4799999999999s)]
