*  Illegal aliens back to their country of origin. He worked with the president to come up with his job description [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  So let's hear from him in his first interview after the major announcement incoming borders are Tom Homan Tom [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=24.54s)]
*  Congratulations to you. It's bad for us. We lose you as a contributor [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=31.66s)]
*  What went into the decision and the position? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=34.82s)]
*  Well, look, I've been on the I've been on this network for years complaining about what this administration did to this border [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=39.82s)]
*  I've been yelling the screaming about it telling what they need to do to fix it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  So when the president asked me would you come back and fix it? Of course, I'd be hip for it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=49.58s)]
*  Didn't so look I'm honored the president asked me to come back and help solve this national security crisis [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=53.9s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to it. I love Fox. I love the family there and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=59.8s)]
*  But I think I think the calling is clear [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=64.82s)]
*  I gotta go back and help because I every morning I get up every morning [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=68.22s)]
*  I'm pissed off about what this administration did to most secure border in my lifetime [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=71.82s)]
*  So I'm gonna go back and do what I can to fix it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=75.18s)]
*  So Tom, let's talk about that the job because you're not an amateur. You've been doing this for years [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=77.52s)]
*  You were beat cop also you worked the border before went over to ice you've done it all [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=82.5s)]
*  What does the process look like because I think some people get the impression that you're shooting from your hip [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=88.06s)]
*  But you know what you're doing here, right? I [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=93.38s)]
*  Know exactly what I'm doing. Look, this is a second time I came out of retirement [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=96.1s)]
*  For this president and because it matters and look I was a board of religion [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=100.74s)]
*  I wore that uniform and I'm proud that I wore that uniform. So and I was a nice agent [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=105.34s)]
*  I was the first ice director actually came up to the ranks. So the 20,000 men and women that worked for me [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=111.04s)]
*  I didn't ask them to do anything. I do myself. I was one of them. So look, I know the border [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=115.76s)]
*  And I know there's a lot of great pages [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=121.52s)]
*  Look, I shut my phone off Friday night because I couldn't handle the phone calls of Texas and emails from thousands of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=123.6s)]
*  Ice agents and board of trail agents excited about the rumor. I'm coming back [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  But more importantly that thousands of retired agents retired board of choices [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=136.2s)]
*  Retired military that want to come in and volunteer to help this president secure the border and do the deportation operation [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  So I've been off the grid for three days just because I couldn't handle all the phone calls and plus of a death risk [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=147.73999999999998s)]
*  rolling in I [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  My family's not at home right now because that's starting but you know, that's something we're gonna deal with they're not gonna bully me away [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=155.6s)]
*  They're not gonna shut me up. They're not gonna make me go away [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  This is the biggest national security vulnerability this nation is seen since 9-eleven we have to fix it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=163.52s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons Kamala Harris lost and Donald Trump won. So so Tom you just mentioned deportations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  I know during the last Trump administration when you were there, they did have the large-scale [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=175.22s)]
*  worksite [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=181.8s)]
*  essentially [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=183.12s)]
*  Raids where they would go into a place and there would be hundreds of people who were in the country illegally [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=184.36s)]
*  I know in 60 minutes a couple of weeks ago. You said that those would continue or under Donald Trump in the next administration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=189.48s)]
*  What do you have planned? Well, I I know you don't want to give away the whole gamebook [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=197.28s)]
*  But you do have deportations mass workplace stuff planned [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=201.44s)]
*  any other kind of category of deportations of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=206.6s)]
*  Interest like as a president as a president set on stage many times, which I agree 100% [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  This will be the same was during the first administration [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=216.68s)]
*  Which is just a hell of a lot more of them because 10 million people are going to this country legally under Biden administration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=219.28s)]
*  Or they actually let into this country, even though it's violation of federal law what they've been doing the abuse of the parole authority [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=224.56s)]
*  But look, I've been clear President Trump's been clear public safety threats and national security threats [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=231.24s)]
*  Will be the priority because they have to be they propose most danger this country. So we're gonna prioritize those [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=236.8s)]
*  Groups those who always have final words [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=242.56s)]
*  Don't have those I had due process a great taxpayer expense and a federal judge says you must go home and they did they became a fugitive [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=244.76s)]
*  So and as far as worksite work site operations have to happen. Here's why I see [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=252.12s)]
*  Where do we find most victims of sex trafficking? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=257.76s)]
*  Enforced labor trafficking at work sites and the Biden administration shut down work sites [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=261.36s)]
*  On one on one point to say we care about sex trafficking human trafficking then they shut down work site enforcement [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=266.42s)]
*  Which is one of the main areas we find the victims of this I want to add one more thing another priority [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=272.46s)]
*  This administration has lost over 300,000 children [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=277.46s)]
*  That they were smuggling this country by criminal cartels. They can't find that's another priority [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=280.94s)]
*  We need to save these children because some of these children forced labor some of these children sex trafficking [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=285.42s)]
*  Some of these children living life a hell every day. We need to save these children getting back with their families [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=290.46s)]
*  You know Tom first of all [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  Congratulations to you and I'm so glad for the Border Patrol that morale is already being lifted [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=297.5s)]
*  They have just been beaten down by the policies of this last administration [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm really encouraged by what you're saying because I think the toughest part of your job isn't isn't the deportation [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=306.62s)]
*  It's dealing with the propaganda from the other side saying that what you're doing is not [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=313.38s)]
*  Is not compassionate that it's it's not humanitarian and what do you plan to do? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=318.86s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned the third the 300,000 children that are missing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=323.82s)]
*  But how are you going to deal with those kinds of attacks? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=327.9s)]
*  even though you know that this open border has led to sex trafficking of children and and an [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  exponential increase of child labor illegal child labor I [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=339.02s)]
*  Frankly I don't care what people think about me [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=344.94s)]
*  especially the left [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  Again, I you know when you have a historic crisis a crisis is big here's what they need to know [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=349.04s)]
*  When you when you have a crisis is big the overwhelms of Border Patrol where the more majority border are no longer on patrol [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=354.24s)]
*  They're making sandwiches or changing diapers and making baby formula [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=361.0s)]
*  They make a hospital runs and making airport runs when you take most of border trades is off the border dealers humanitarian crisis [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  That's when a fat mall comes across to kill a quarter million Americans. That's what a sex trafficking has increased 600% [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  That's what no suspected terraces cross this country. They've had a record of people on terrorist losses that been arrested us on border [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=376.2s)]
*  That's why you have over two million. God always how many of them came back country's not your terror [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=382.68s)]
*  So I don't care where anybody's opinion is not illegal immigration when you create a crisis this big all these other bad things happen [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=387.08s)]
*  That's we have to secure the border. I don't care for Republican a Democrat or independent [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=393.56s)]
*  Border security is national security. We should all be on the same side in that I've been saying it's for last couple years [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=398.56s)]
*  And then directly FBI actually reason I don't respect him greatly [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=406.04s)]
*  But he agrees me the Southwest board is the biggest national security vulnerability this nation's ever seen [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=409.64s)]
*  He sees more brave flags down ever before we have to secure the border [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=414.74s)]
*  And as far as the people want to push back on an important piece [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=418.64s)]
*  So what is the option that you have the right to claim asylum? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=421.92s)]
*  You have a right to see a judge and we make that happen [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=425.0s)]
*  But at the end of that due process and the judge says you must go home then we have to take them home [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=427.32s)]
*  Because if we're not what the hell are we doing if the judges order doesn't mean anything [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=433.08s)]
*  Then shut down the immigration court take the border to off the border [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=438.44s)]
*  There's no consequences by laying laws of this country will give you a fair shake [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=441.96s)]
*  You give a chance to claim asylum, but due process doesn't mean squat [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  If the final decision of the court isn't isn't carried out [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=450.16s)]
*  What is the option let them all stay because if that's the option you want you're never going to fix this on the border [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=454.0s)]
*  Because you send a message to the whole world come to the United States [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=460.44s)]
*  Enter the country legally, which is a crime [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=463.96s)]
*  Don't show up a court or show up in court get or removal, but you still get to stay that doesn't work [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=466.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess she's got it you had to build a wall and he got to stop sanctuary cities both times the Democrats [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  Stopped every time they every time he went forward they put gum you up in court [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=478.88s)]
*  You don't have to give it away [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=483.44s)]
*  But is there a plan if sanctuary cities these city councils don't allow the sanctuary cities to go away [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=484.72s)]
*  Is there a plan B you have? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=491.32s)]
*  Well, I think look it'd be great to have local law enforcement [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=494.24s)]
*  Assist ice because you know one thing we're under 9-eleven a report was we shouldn't have snowpipes law enforcement [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=498.96s)]
*  She worked in law enforcement, but you know there's two things number one under President Trump [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=505.28s)]
*  He was suing the sanctuary cities DOJ soon sanctuary cities pulling federal funds of course [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=509.56s)]
*  Day one when Joe Biden came in obviously stopped that lawsuit [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=514.64s)]
*  So that's be put back in place and look I've seen I've seen these some of these Democratic governors say they're gonna stand in the way [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NP55RI5mhY&t=517.6199999999999s)]
