# Jon Voight TORCHES Gavin Newsom: 'Nothing but a lying dog'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U)
*  of anti-ice protests breaking out in Los Angeles and other major cities including the one we're in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=0.0s)]
*  Massive crowds seen fighting back against law enforcement in cities like LA, Seattle, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=5.28s)]
*  New York, Las Vegas, just to name a few. Jonathan Hunt is live in LA with the very latest this morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=10.64s)]
*  Jonathan. Ainsley Lawrence, Brian, good morning to you all. We are still two hours away from a second [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=16.8s)]
*  night of curfew ending here in LA and clearly these protests have been picking up right across [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=24.08s)]
*  the country now. They may have started here but looking west to east we saw protests last night [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=31.92s)]
*  in Seattle, in Las Vegas, in San Antonio, Texas and of course in New York City. If there is any [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=37.28s)]
*  good news to all of that it's that law enforcement in all of those cities appeared to have a good [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  handle on the protests, none of which really got out of hand in the way that we have seen [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=51.04s)]
*  some of the protests here in LA. As for LA itself, the main focus last night of the protesters [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=56.64s)]
*  appeared to be City Hall. The LA Sheriff's Department obviously, the Sheriff himself, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=63.68s)]
*  headquartered there and the LA Sheriff's Department led the effort to push the protesters away from [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=67.68s)]
*  City Hall through the evening. Police on horseback also came in with their nightsticks drawn. Those [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=74.72s)]
*  tactics appeared to be effective too in driving what was a much smaller crowd than we have seen [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=81.28s)]
*  on previous days away. By the time we got to 8pm local time last night, as you can see from these [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=86.96s)]
*  aerial shots, the crowds had thinned out remarkably. That's the 8pm of course was the start of the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  curfew. The last few remaining stragglers were pushed out by law enforcement and ultimately it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=99.28s)]
*  was a relatively quiet night. Meantime officials here warn once again that they will track down [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=105.84s)]
*  anyone involved in any acts of violence against law enforcement officers or indeed against property [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=113.84s)]
*  here in LA. Here's the LA County DA, Nathan Hockman. Let me provide some bad news for you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=121.68s)]
*  There's a tremendous amount of video out there through social media and otherwise. We will know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=129.28s)]
*  who you are, who engaged in this conduct. We will track you down, we will arrest you, we will prosecute [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=135.84s)]
*  you and we will punish you. So for people who've already engaged in this illegal activity, we're [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=142.8s)]
*  coming for you. Now up in San Francisco today in a courtroom up there, Governor Gavin Newsom will [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=149.44s)]
*  be presenting his case asking that the National Guard troops federalized by President Trump be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=158.4s)]
*  put back under his command. The DOJ has described that action by Governor Newsom, that legal action [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  as quote a crass political stunt endangering American lives. But that side of this drama [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=173.76s)]
*  will play out in a courtroom in San Francisco this afternoon. Lawrence Ainsley, Brian back to you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=181.68s)]
*  All right, thanks so much Jonathan. So he goes from curfew to curfew. I mean the sun went down, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=187.04s)]
*  that's when people are supposed to go home. If you as soon as you're out of the past the curfew, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=191.6s)]
*  you're in danger of being detained. This argument that Gavin Newsom is making that he wants it to be [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  back in his command, I think it's just juvenile. You didn't show up when the people needed you [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=202.64s)]
*  and there's crisis after crisis to show for. I mean we got the big wall right here. What was he [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  doing COVID? He was at the French laundry having a good time. Meanwhile he closed all the schools [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=213.12s)]
*  for K through 12. It impacted six million of our kids, the homeless crisis. They lead the nation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  and the homeless population yet they also give the homeless population the most funding and they [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=224.72s)]
*  still have the most there. You got the wildfire response, bad leadership, blamed the poor water [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=230.0s)]
*  management, delays on misplaced priorities. Then the state budget we just gave them seven billion [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=236.08s)]
*  dollars for that high speed rail. Well they've never even laid a foot of track. It doesn't go [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=242.24s)]
*  from San Francisco to... You can't even handle this stuff. An epic fail. It's way over but I would add [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=247.44s)]
*  something else to him. He says his San Bernardino fires and I need my national guard to go to it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=252.8s)]
*  but they are stuck right now in Los Angeles. Blaming Trump. Blaming Trump for that but I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=258.24s)]
*  just don't think he has a constitutional argument that I have seen that would have him trump Trump [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=264.08s)]
*  and take the national guard back. This is what actor John Voight shared on social media. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=269.44s)]
*  You're a fool blaming Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=277.6s)]
*  What are you doing for this destruction of these animals destroying Los Angeles? Are you there [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=282.56s)]
*  talking calmly with them? You fool. They would burn you down like they're burning the cars and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=289.52s)]
*  the American flag with no regard for humanity. This is not about Trump. This is about protecting [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=296.08s)]
*  the people from these animals and criminals trying to destroy us and our police force. Are they [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  supposed to stand there let rocks hit them and kill them? Who's going to save them? You? You're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  a disgrace. You're nothing but a lying dog for the hopes of becoming the president one day. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=315.36s)]
*  This Glendale Community College professor sent out an email encouraging all the students to riot [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=321.76s)]
*  too. Kim Kardashian put on Instagram when we're told that ICE exists to keep our country safe or [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=327.6s)]
*  remove criminals great. When we witness innocent hard-working people being ripped from their [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=333.04s)]
*  families we have to speak up and then Trisha McLaughlin answers. Kim Kardashian which one of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=337.2s)]
*  these convicted child molesters, murderers, drug traffickers and rapists would you like to stay in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=342.24s)]
*  the country? There are just a few of the convicted illegals who have been picked up in the last 72 [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=346.0s)]
*  hours. I I just highlighted some of these criminals. Homicide, burglary, drug activity, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=350.72s)]
*  battery, lewd acts with children, assault, money laundering, human smuggling, burglary. Then there's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  this illegal migrant that we've been talking about this morning who was arrested. He had already been [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=361.36s)]
*  deported once. He was arrested twice last year for a DUI and for theft. He was on the loose because [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  of the sanctuary city laws in California. They were he was ignored by the cops because the laws [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  protect the criminals in California. So two things on this. Kim K I know you don't know this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=376.56s)]
*  because you didn't go to a real law school but what about the American families that had their [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=381.92s)]
*  daughters ripped away from their families? Yeah. Every single month that we were reporting of an [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=387.92s)]
*  illegal killing some American citizen and number two so if we're going to allow this to happen when [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=393.6s)]
*  illegal criminals when the ICE officers show up with a warrant for their arrest do Americans now [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=399.6s)]
*  not have to abide by warrants when the cops show up? Can they barricade them? Can their families [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=406.0s)]
*  create a barricade outside? Should there be protests when they don't want to go to jail? When [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=411.92s)]
*  a warrant is shown up it's a dangerous precedent to set to say that you don't have to comply with [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=416.0s)]
*  court orders. In terms of the idiot parade how about adding Katy Perry to it? She writes on [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=421.76s)]
*  Instagram this is once Mexican this was once Mexican land and the people being targeted today [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=427.92s)]
*  are often descendants of those who lived here for future generations. Do we really want to go back [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=432.64s)]
*  to the Incas and find out who was here? Would you like to give up parts of Texas? Do you want to give [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  a part of California? I mean what is wrong with you? They're upset that their butlers and their [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=442.32s)]
*  landscapers might have to go back to the country where they're from. I was saying this in the first [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=447.12s)]
*  hour talked to a lady she's an American citizen now but she's originally from Brazil. She said [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  if these riots happen in Brazil and people started waving flags from other countries and burning the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=457.2s)]
*  Brazilian flag they would end up in some back alley. We don't stand for that she said in Brazil. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=462.08s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFpNSt_77U&t=467.91999999999996s)]
