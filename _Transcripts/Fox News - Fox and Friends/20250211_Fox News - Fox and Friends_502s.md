# Doocy: Trump admin has its ways to flush out leakers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI)
*  All right, all that's going on overseas but back here at home president Trump's immigration crackdown continues as Homeland Security now looks to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=0.0s)]
*  deputize IRS agents to help boost enforcement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  Efforts senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us live. Good morning, Peter. Good morning [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=11.42s)]
*  Sometimes those IRS agents would be helping build a tax or money laundering case against an illegal immigrant [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=16.54s)]
*  But sometimes they're just gonna be standing there next to the door while a SWAT team knocks it down [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  They can certainly cover a back door. They can certainly transport. They can certainly help process the non-criminal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=29.32s)]
*  IRS agent they can help us process and do some intelligence and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=34.72s)]
*  Wrap around infrastructure planning. We'll take them we can use all the help we can get because this is a big operation [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Homeland Security wrote to the Treasury Department about these extra IRS hands [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  It is DHS is understanding that the Department of the Treasury has qualified law enforcement personnel available [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=50.08s)]
*  To assist with immigration enforcement, especially in light of recent increases to the Internal Revenue Services [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=56.2s)]
*  workforce and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=62.44s)]
*  Budget there are more tools the Trump team is using here including for the first time ever in a counter cartel [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=63.68s)]
*  Operation a u2 spy plane has been flying over US soil according to a report by CNN law enforcement [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=70.12s)]
*  Sometimes struggles to keep up with cartel technology [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=77.08s)]
*  The US military is not gonna have such a hard time and all of this just creates a big new deterrent that is being noticed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=80.34s)]
*  Around the world the New York Post is citing sources at the border who claim that groups of dozens of migrants at a time [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=87.7s)]
*  Are not even making their way all the way up to the border to claim asylum [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=94.42s)]
*  They are just turning around and going home back to you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  Which is pretty amazing because that was the whole goal and I remember when congressman [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=102.7s)]
*  Cuellar said you need to show video of them being turned around and going back and I thought why he goes [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=107.74s)]
*  That's all they see in Central South America because then it's no longer worth the money [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=113.33999999999999s)]
*  The question is Peter if the numbers keep staying low [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=117.1s)]
*  I wonder how long you need military out there soon. They're gonna have to maybe decrease the numbers [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=120.02s)]
*  For as long as Donald Trump is president [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=126.14s)]
*  It would seem like they're gonna remain there because he promised there's a secure border the deportation numbers have not been as [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=128.22s)]
*  Fast as a lot of people around here at the Trump White House would like and so [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=136.18s)]
*  The easiest way to avoid delays with deportation is just to let fewer people in Peter any word on the leaks [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=140.9s)]
*  Any information on where they're coming from? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=148.34s)]
*  I know the Department of Justice and they're going after the person. Is this a holdover that's turning this information over? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=150.66000000000003s)]
*  What's the latest on this? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=157.46s)]
*  Hard to speculate about who it is, but Tom Holman is really steamed [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=159.78s)]
*  Tom Holman has the president's ear and so this is it is very unusual [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  Even though there are constant leak investigations in Washington. It's very unusual to have the commander-in-chief himself [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=170.32s)]
*  So invested in trying to figure out who is leaking. It seems like it is coming from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  somebody [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=182.32s)]
*  with knowledge [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=183.56s)]
*  That only a small group of people would have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  And the small group gets smaller and smaller and smaller [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=188.84s)]
*  Until they figure out who the leak is and they have they have different ways of figuring this out [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=193.48s)]
*  sometimes they try to flush out leakers by [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=197.52s)]
*  Telling a small group false information to see if the false information gets out there [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=200.28s)]
*  and so they they have some tricks and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=205.68s)]
*  They'll try yeah [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=211.48s)]
*  They say it's the FBI he Tom Holman accused the FBI of putting officers lives at risk by leaking ice details [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  He thinks it's out in the West Coast [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=219.2s)]
*  So I mean cash Patel can't get there quick enough [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  I know we'll see what well and and law enforcement officers swear an oath to not do that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=223.64s)]
*  And there are a lot of policies on top of that HR policies that they would be violating [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  But whoever if whoever is leaking the information that is tipping people off to these law enforcement raids [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  They are facing severe federal penalties [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely, and the law enforcement could get hurt and that's the worry Peter. Thank you very much [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=246.68s)]
*  Thanks Peter Peter did mention the number of migrant encounters at our southern border is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=251.6s)]
*  Absolutely dwindling when you take a look at the number of migrants who were encountered on Sunday just about 300 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=257.0s)]
*  The average day in December during the Biden administration was eight thousand now [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=264.88s)]
*  Here's what's different about it is under the Trump administration. We've got another graphic, you know [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=270.08s)]
*  No, they they have ended catch-and-release and so during the first two weeks of the Trump administration [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=275.44s)]
*  only [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  461 were released into the United States that means [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=284.8s)]
*  94% were not released [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=289.52s)]
*  Whereas when you look at the Joe Biden number it was five thousand a day [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  And seventy percent of them were released into the country [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=297.56s)]
*  Yeah, I I want to know who those three hundred and three people are [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=301.56s)]
*  Because it's like hey, it's essentially a brick wall now [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=306.12s)]
*  Well part of the reason why the numbers are so low is because they're not even allowed to cross [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  So for example, you used to have a lot of migrants come across the border and they just surrender to ice [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=314.24s)]
*  I'm sorry to border patrol right and they would have to ask are you seeking asylum? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Some of them went through the app they did multiple fact [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=324.12s)]
*  What's happening now when you see Border Patrol or the military see these folks or if you see them in the Rio Grande or something? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Like they're saying turn back around right? You can't jump if you try to jump the fence [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  They're gonna use right, you know pepper spray [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=337.2s)]
*  They're gonna use any tool the beanbags or they're gonna physically push you back across them across the border [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  So there used to be this posture of just letting them come across [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=345.68s)]
*  That's no longer the case [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=349.52s)]
*  What is a forgotten part of the story is we're talking a lot about the migrants but the people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=350.8s)]
*  Who live on ranches and farms along the southern border? We've all visited those those people and done and done pieces down there [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  They said that they felt completely forgotten by the Biden administration who just let hundreds of migrants across across their property [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=360.8s)]
*  And many of them live in you know [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=367.26s)]
*  All of them live in very rural areas where the police department is very far away and they felt threatened for their safety [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=368.84s)]
*  of course, I spoke to a woman who had [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=374.48s)]
*  14 and 12 year old daughter and remember and we're in the woman was teaching them how to use a gun just in case anything [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=378.64s)]
*  Happened so I mean what a relief to those Americans who now feel that their property is more safe [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  So this is private land and just as sweeping on everything we just discussed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=390.64s)]
*  There's gonna be huge sweep out in California. They announced it already of illegals and they're already pushing back [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=394.28s)]
*  I'm watching video this morning pushing back with the whole California State College system pro-palestinian [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  anti-ice [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=405.67999999999995s)]
*  protest the ask backwards state that is and then you have [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=407.04s)]
*  The this stat that came out you wonder why people weren't feeling the employment and the employment numbers are down [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=411.56s)]
*  The economy is doing great part of it is since January 2020 [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=417.26s)]
*  88 percent of employment growth went to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=421.2s)]
*  Immigrants this year and illegal immigrants is up 4.7 million compared to that last year [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=424.36s)]
*  So the people who are getting the jobs in America are here illegally temporarily [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=430.04s)]
*  So we're not feeling the job increase people are benefiting from illegals working here [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=435.7s)]
*  So that goes that goes to the overall picture of how come you tell me the economy is great [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  And I don't feel it because it isn't us getting the jobs [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=445.9s)]
*  Well, the southern border is feeling it because the New York Post has got an exclusive story this morning talking about how they're seeing people [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=449.3s)]
*  They they either are looking at these numbers and they're turning around right or they're already heading back. They're heading south [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=456.38s)]
*  There the the flow of migrants north is [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=463.5s)]
*  Slowing way down and now it's picking up going back south. It's like one way [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  They said in Honduras last week that discovered a group of 25 migrants right Venezuela in Cuba traveling south back to Nicaragua [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=472.78s)]
*  Another group of 23 from Honduras Venezuela Panama and El Salvador turning back from Mexico. So they're interviewing them as they're leaving [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=479.38s)]
*  That's the goal send the message put your bite. That's why the cartel is upset right now [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=486.58s)]
*  You [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXz9UBvpwXI&t=493.46s)]
