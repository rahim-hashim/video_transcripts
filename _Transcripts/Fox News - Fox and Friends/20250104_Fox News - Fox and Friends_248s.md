# Ex-Green Beret who knew Las Vegas suspect: ‘None of this checks out’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug)
*  New details emerge about the suspect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Las Vegas Cybertruck Explosion [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=2.6s)]
*  as police reveal letters left behind [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=4.44s)]
*  by Army Soldier Matthew Livelsberger. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=6.84s)]
*  This is an excerpt from that letter. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=10.8s)]
*  He says, fellow service members, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  veterans and all Americans, time to wake up. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=14.92s)]
*  We are being led by weak and feceless leadership [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=16.96s)]
*  who only serve to enrich themselves. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=19.16s)]
*  This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake-up call. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=21.04s)]
*  Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=23.28s)]
*  What better way to get my point across [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=26.16s)]
*  than a stunt with fireworks and explosives? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=27.6s)]
*  Our next guest, former Green Beret, Tim Kennedy, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=30.84s)]
*  knew the suspect and is shown here with him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=34.76s)]
*  They both competed in a military-style reality show. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=37.6s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=40.72s)]
*  Tim, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=42.0s)]
*  First off, I just gotta ask you, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=44.28s)]
*  it had to have been pretty wild for you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=45.72s)]
*  to have seen the story and the news coverage of it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=48.16s)]
*  and then to look at pictures and say, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=52.0s)]
*  oh my gosh, I knew this guy, I've met this guy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=53.84s)]
*  Yeah, it took about 36 hours, honestly, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=58.34s)]
*  about a day, day and a half into it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=61.540000000000006s)]
*  when more photos started emerging [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=63.5s)]
*  as to what he looked like in some photos [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  from earlier in his life, 10 years, 15 years ago [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  when I knew him, before I was able to put it together [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  and I was just flabbergasted, I was left speechless. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=73.5s)]
*  I couldn't believe it because I really enjoyed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=76.58000000000001s)]
*  the time that I got to spend with him [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  and I found him to be incredibly competent and talented [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=80.86s)]
*  as a special forces operator. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=84.38s)]
*  I was floored, to be honest. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=86.74s)]
*  I didn't know what to do or say. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=88.7s)]
*  Anything, and I realize, obviously, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=90.3s)]
*  you didn't stay in touch with him over the years, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=92.58s)]
*  but anything that you remember particularly [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=94.38s)]
*  about his personality that strikes you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  as particularly kind of hard to wrap your brain around? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=98.98s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie, start to finish categorically. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=103.58s)]
*  The guy was a great dude. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=106.7s)]
*  He was a fit, he was a good shooter, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=107.9s)]
*  he was a good communicator. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=111.42s)]
*  There's five, six events that we did [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=113.42s)]
*  in this reality competition show, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=115.3s)]
*  mostly based around soldier skills [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=117.94s)]
*  and in every instance, he was seemingly a great person. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=120.86s)]
*  None of this checks out, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=127.38s)]
*  on the special forces side, he was first [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=128.66s)]
*  a special forces communication sergeant [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=130.78s)]
*  and then an intelligence sergeant [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=132.94s)]
*  and then ultimately an 18 Zulu. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=134.34s)]
*  So he went through kind of every single one [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=136.62s)]
*  of the checks and balances. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=139.9s)]
*  He was a talented green beret [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=140.98s)]
*  and sounds like everybody liked to work with him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  So none of this makes sense and it's so heartbreaking. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=147.06s)]
*  I truly hope that, you know, this is a wake-up call [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=149.54s)]
*  for service members to make sure [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=152.7s)]
*  that we're checking in with each other right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  But yeah, it's just so heart-wrenching. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=157.14s)]
*  So you guys are green berets, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=160.14s)]
*  you're the absolute best of the best [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  and I guess that's part of the reason [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=164.06s)]
*  why this is also shocking to those of us watching this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  and especially people who know green berets. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=170.46s)]
*  What did you make of those letters? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=173.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they seemed unhinged. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=178.66s)]
*  You know, his current standing was one [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  that he is a good soldier and, you know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  then kind of clearly in a few months leading up [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=187.22s)]
*  to what happened in front of the Trump Tower in Las Vegas, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=190.34s)]
*  something broke. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=196.22s)]
*  And they're very scary letters to come from somebody [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=197.42s)]
*  that is so talented in so many different things. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=202.78s)]
*  You know, the selection process for green berets is arduous [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  and they're very, very particular [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=209.26s)]
*  and very rarely do you see, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  of course there's gonna be bad apples, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=213.54s)]
*  but this doesn't seem like a bad apple. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  This seems like somebody that was hurt or broken [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=217.1s)]
*  or very scared. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=220.22s)]
*  And, you know, it's just, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=221.82s)]
*  it's, I've been at a loss for words [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=224.68s)]
*  for the past day and a half. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think a lot of us are. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=229.16s)]
*  Tim Kennedy, thank you for your service [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=232.24s)]
*  and thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=233.88s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Charlie, God bless. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kfKPhVfug&t=236.44s)]
