# Army recruiting shatters records after Trump win: 'Best number in 15 years'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0)
*  Let's talk about some good news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, so we got some good news from the Secretary of Defense. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=1.2s)]
*  It looks like the US Army recruit [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=4.04s)]
*  had their most productive December in 15 years, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=5.92s)]
*  listing 346 soldiers daily into the world's greatest army. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=10.24s)]
*  I just think it's so powerful. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=17.2s)]
*  And I had the opportunity to talk to some troops. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=18.68s)]
*  So much spirit at the border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=21.6s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=23.0s)]
*  How does it feel to have the Secretary of Defense here, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=24.64s)]
*  greet you guys personally, talk to you, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=26.88s)]
*  get you all concerned? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=28.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's important that the Secretary of Defense [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=30.12s)]
*  come down and actually have the leaders of the department [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=32.32s)]
*  come down and kind of see eyes on, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=35.48s)]
*  perspective at the tactical level. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=38.16s)]
*  Because ideas and orders that come down from top, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=40.04s)]
*  they don't know how all that impacts the soldiers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=44.96s)]
*  But I think it's great for him, especially his first trip out, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  to come down and actually get the thoughts of the leaders [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=51.2s)]
*  and the soldiers on the ground and how we can best [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=53.6s)]
*  execute this mission. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  So tell me about the operation that you guys [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=56.6s)]
*  are going to be doing at the border. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=58.28s)]
*  What specifically would you be doing? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=59.68s)]
*  So we have soldiers down here really just [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  manning different detection and monitoring locations, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=63.36s)]
*  really designed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=66.2s)]
*  The Border Patrol works hand in glove with us [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=67.0s)]
*  to put us in the best positions possible to help support them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=68.8s)]
*  So we have soldiers out here 24-7, 365. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=72.56s)]
*  And we do everything that we possibly can [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  to support our DHS partners. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=77.08s)]
*  What's your number one mission? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=78.68s)]
*  Number one mission is trying to keep the American border safe [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=80.0s)]
*  and then just trying to detect and defend the border [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=82.64s)]
*  as much as we possibly can. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=85.56s)]
*  This happened after President Trump was elected, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=87.24s)]
*  after Pete Hegseth was nominated as defense secretary. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=89.8s)]
*  So enlistment going up, 350 soldiers every single day [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  this past December. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=98.16s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=99.0s)]
*  That is the best recruiting number in 12 years, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=99.96s)]
*  according to the Army. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  The Army hit its best number in 15 years overall. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=103.8s)]
*  America's youth want to serve. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=106.96s)]
*  Just make it something that people feel rewarded for doing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=108.56s)]
*  And I want to see those families who do so much for our country. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  I think 1% serves the 350 million. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=115.52s)]
*  But so many are legacies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=118.28s)]
*  My grandfather, my father, my... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=119.64s)]
*  And they stopped after Afghanistan. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=121.8s)]
*  Hopefully they'll say, son, daughter, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=124.36s)]
*  if you want to go in, I support you now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=126.92s)]
*  Well, ever since COVID, the numbers have started to slump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=128.76s)]
*  And then we've also got standards. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=132.12s)]
*  And too many people are obese. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=133.8s)]
*  And also the Army's got essentially their own SAT test [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=136.16s)]
*  to see whether or not you can get in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=141.68s)]
*  They've started doing prep classes, which is great. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=143.28s)]
*  Physical prep too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=145.72s)]
*  Yeah, one of the problems is they don't have enough facilities. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=146.72s)]
*  And so in the last couple of weeks, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=150.36s)]
*  the Army announced that they are going to expand basic training [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=152.12s)]
*  at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri and Fort Sill in Oklahoma [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=155.32s)]
*  to bring in about another 10,000 per year. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=159.44s)]
*  Last year, they actually hit their number. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=162.96s)]
*  They wanted 53,000. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=165.36s)]
*  They hit 53,300. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=166.64s)]
*  Wood Branch Army? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=168.52s)]
*  The Army. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=169.48s)]
*  So a lot of it, they also lowered their standing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=170.32s)]
*  What year was Afghanistan's withdrawal? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  Was that 2023 or? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=175.12s)]
*  2021. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay, 2021. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, in 2023, the US military missed the recruiting goals [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=178.16s)]
*  by 41,000. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=181.56s)]
*  I think a lot of this had to do with who the commander in chief was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=182.76s)]
*  and the decisions he was making that affected the lives of our military. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  Did you ever hear Joe Biden say, I need you guys to serve? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=188.88s)]
*  Did you ever see a commercial be all you can be? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=191.68s)]
*  Did you ever see a warrior looking like a warrior in these commercials? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  They were great. Army could put out these great ads. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  They hired these major companies. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  They stopped doing it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=200.76s)]
*  It was like gender equality crap. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=201.84s)]
*  And they also were pushing back on letting them into high schools. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=204.28s)]
*  You need to tell high school kids, I know you're thinking about college. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=209.6s)]
*  I just want you to know what we can offer you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=213.08s)]
*  I just think we've got to have a pro-America strength type message. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=215.36s)]
*  We got some video of America winning. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=220.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=222.04s)]
*  Push that out there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=223.16s)]
*  As someone that is the first generation in my family not to serve, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=224.6s)]
*  all my grandparents, my father, grandmother, grandfather, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=227.88s)]
*  and it goes on and on and on, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=231.84s)]
*  they discouraged me from joining the military [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  because of how the military had been. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  They would not focus on certain things. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  I think the Secretary of Defense is going to shift that message. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  And you already see it with the guys on the ground. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  They're so happy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I haven't witnessed that in a minute, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=247.08s)]
*  not just with the Border Patrol, but the service members. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=249.56s)]
*  Brian asked me when we were off camera, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=252.0s)]
*  did they tell you which ones you can interview? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=253.96s)]
*  No, they didn't. They said, just go. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  Just go out there and talk with the guys. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  And the guys were... They were astonished. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  They go, I don't think I've been approved to talk. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=261.76s)]
*  And one of the aides said, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense has approved you to talk. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  Tell them what you want to tell them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  That's good having a guy with TV experience [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  because it's not like, okay, we've focused group this one guy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=270.32s)]
*  He's got the perfect point of view. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=273.68s)]
*  Ask anybody in the line. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  They're going to say exactly, you want to find out how they feel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=276.6s)]
*  They're going to tell you how they feel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhWl0QQ0d0&t=280.36s)]
