# Hedge fund billionaire pleads with Trump: Call a 'time-out'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU)
*  This morning a defiant President Trump says his tariffs are working and he is not backing down [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=0.0s)]
*  But hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman who endorsed Donald Trump for the first time this election disagrees [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=5.48s)]
*  The investor warning the president has an opportunity to call a 90-day timeout [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=12.24s)]
*  Negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals. We're heading for a self-induced [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Economic nuclear winter and we should start hunkering down. Yeah, it goes on for pages, but you get the theme [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=23.44s)]
*  Joining us now is from the White House on North Lawn director of the National Economic Council Kevin acid Kevin. Great to see you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=29.74s)]
*  Good morning guys. You're great explaining these things but your response to an ally Ken Ackman saying that will you do a 90-day pause? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=36.42s)]
*  Would you consider that or a bill? Yeah, you know [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=43.94s)]
*  I think that the president is going to decide what the president's going to decide [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  There are more than 50 countries in negotiation with the president. We've got the Prime Minister of Israel coming today [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=50.06s)]
*  We've had a reach out overnight from Taiwan and but I but I would urge everyone especially bill to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  ease the ease off the rhetoric a little bit the fact is that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  say 10% baseline tariff is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=68.48s)]
*  on what 14% of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=71.56s)]
*  GDP that's about how much trade we have how many imports and so 86% of GDP is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  affected by the deregulation and the tax cuts and everything else and even if you think and and I think [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=80.18s)]
*  a lot of us at the White House think that these are [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=85.4s)]
*  These economic responses are exaggerated by critics [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=88.2s)]
*  Even if you think that there will be some negative effect from the trade side [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=90.92s)]
*  That's still a small share of GDP as the idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=94.04s)]
*  Rhetoric so obviously this these are all things that President Trump ran an election on and won an election [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Talking about and he's been talking about it for a long time [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  And where it's not a surprise that the markets have tumbled in response to this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=109.12s)]
*  But is there a point at which? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=113.8s)]
*  President Trump looks at the markets and says oh my gosh. We're at [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=115.88s)]
*  35,000 of on the Dow [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=120.08s)]
*  This is too painful [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=122.36s)]
*  The president has made it clear that this policy he believes will help American workers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=124.28s)]
*  And there's a reason why he believes that because policies like this in his last term did help American workers after really two decades [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Of no real wage growth in the u.s. We got more than six thousand dollars for family [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=136.76s)]
*  After we had tariffs and tax cuts of deregulation [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=142.24s)]
*  and so he's doubling down on something that he knows works and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=145.88s)]
*  He's going to continue to do that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=149.0s)]
*  But he is also going to listen to our trading partners and if they come to us with really great deals that advantage American [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=150.4s)]
*  Manufacturing and American farmers. I'm sure he'll listen [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=156.84s)]
*  But in the end is President Trump that's going to decide when a deal is good enough [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=159.36s)]
*  And I think it's interesting that so many countries are lining up the final thing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=162.76s)]
*  I'd like to say is that there's so many people that keep saying oh, it's the American consumer [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=166.12s)]
*  That's going to bear this tariff is going to make inflation go up and so on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=170.24s)]
*  but if you think about it President Trump's view is it's these countries that are sending inelastic supply to the country and so they're [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=173.24s)]
*  Going to bear the brunt of the tariffs and if that were false [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=180.24s)]
*  Then it looks so if they didn't bear the brunt then they'd be quiet about it, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=183.88s)]
*  the fact that they're all angry and upset and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=187.88s)]
*  You know sending retaliation our way it suggests that President Trump is right that they bear the tariffs [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  If they're worried about bearing the tariff that would explain their behavior, it's not the American consumer [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=196.52s)]
*  So if you're saying that he's waiting on great deals and 50 countries have already come to the table [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  Have have any of them been great deals good enough for him to negotiate with I? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=207.44s)]
*  I've seen some deals that are great and the President Trump is President Trump is going to decide if they're great enough [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  But again after after decades and decades of mistreating American workers [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  It's gonna be tough to get him to decide to really cover the table and sign on the dotted line [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=222.22s)]
*  But what he does he's gonna sign with that big long beautiful signature and he'll have made a great deal for America [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=226.78s)]
*  Just give you an idea what the world is saying as you know in the Washington Post today [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=232.0s)]
*  The British government said we're going to make major concessions Vietnam says how about zero zero tariffs Italy's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=235.18s)]
*  Economic minister says we're looking to de-escalate with the United States [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=242.66s)]
*  So he while the European Union thinks about their response we should get it soon [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=245.62s)]
*  Individual countries seem to want to outside France who seem to be in the retaliation mode seem to want to do deals [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=249.9s)]
*  So Jamie diamond puts out his letter [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=257.66s)]
*  Quarterly and everyone kind of looks at it because of the respect he has [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=260.74s)]
*  Internationally and of course at home and here's an excerpt [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=264.3s)]
*  He says the autocratic nations of the world and some of the non-aligned nations would like to see a fragmentation of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=267.1s)]
*  America's economic alliances and a weaken of our global position our long-term strategic goals should be crystal clear to maintain [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  The cohesion and strength of the Western world including their economies if the Western world's military and economic alliances were to fragment [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=279.3s)]
*  America itself would inevitably weaken over time. Do you agree with that? What do you take from that? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=286.82s)]
*  Well, I am friends with Jamie and I have a high regard for him [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  But here's what I think I think that president Trump came into office with the biggest debt to GDP that we've seen in the US [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  Ever since World War two we've had absolute spending out of control [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  Inflation out of control and a collapse of the manufacturing sector with thousands hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs going away [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  Villages and towns all around the country in despair [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=316.26s)]
*  There are even books written about the deaths of despair because the manufacturing jobs are closed and what we're doing right now is we're fixing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  That we're fixing that we're fixing that with reduced spending with smarter tax policy with tariff policy [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=326.41999999999996s)]
*  And it's going to make America have a bigger manufacturing sector a bigger fiscal surplus or a smaller fiscal deficit and a smaller trade deficit [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=332.66s)]
*  All of those things make America stronger if those things make America stronger than obviously our influence around the world is going to go up as well [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=339.66s)]
*  How influential would the US be if it were bankrupt? Let me tell you if we had four more years of Joe Biden's behavior, Joe Biden's policies [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  We probably would have been very close to bankruptcy and that's why we're coming at it with with everything we've got to fix the economy of the four years that President Trump has [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=355.02s)]
*  So what do you expect to come out of today's meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=362.66s)]
*  They've got a heck of a lot to talk about. I'm sure they're going to talk about trade policy and also Middle East policy as well. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=367.86s)]
*  All right, well, we're going to wait and see about these negotiations. What country do you think that Donald Trump will negotiate with first? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=375.98s)]
*  Do you think it'll be Israel because we are allies and they've gone through so much? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=383.02s)]
*  Well, Israel is the first meeting today, but President Trump has talked to world leaders all weekend and a whole bunch of countries have been talking to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=386.62s)]
*  James and Greer and Howard Letnick over the last few weeks so that if we did pass the reciprocal tariffs that they'd be ready with parameters of what might make a good deal. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  All right, we'll see about China. That's the big one and see what their reaction is going to be. Thanks so much, Kevin Hassett. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWzKuibgRU&t=403.38s)]
