# Inside El Salvador's mega prison: Youtuber reveals what he saw
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk)
*  Our next guest got a look inside the El Salvador prison where those alleged gang members are being held. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=0.0s)]
*  YouTube content creator Nick Shirley joins us now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=6.0s)]
*  Nick, first of all, how did you get permission to get into the prison? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=10.0s)]
*  What made you want to go in and what was the process? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. It's a fascinating building and very few people have ever been given permission to go inside. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=18.0s)]
*  So I feel grateful that I was able to go in. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=27.0s)]
*  Was it a long process? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, I worked on getting the permission for months and months. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=34.0s)]
*  I'm still the only American to ever go in besides the last person who just went in. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah, which was Secretary Cristina. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=42.0s)]
*  All right, so tell me what you saw. What shocked you the most? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=44.0s)]
*  Yeah, as soon as you enter, the building is just massive. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=48.0s)]
*  You can see right there you go face to face with some of the worst people that are roaming the earth right now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=51.0s)]
*  It really is shocking. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=57.0s)]
*  How many people? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=59.0s)]
*  There's capacity for 80 people in each cell and then there's about 10 of them inside. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=61.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of people around 800 people inside. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=67.0s)]
*  And so these people live in this cell, like 80 of them per cell. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=70.0s)]
*  They sleep there. They go to the bathroom in front of everybody in that cell. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=76.0s)]
*  There are no doors. There are no curtains. There is no privacy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=82.0s)]
*  Is that for security or is there a psychological angle to this? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=85.0s)]
*  Really, I think it's security and these prisoners are stripped away from all their privileges. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=90.0s)]
*  So whatever happens in there, everybody can see. They don't get access to go outside. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=96.0s)]
*  Once they're inside, they'll never see the sun again and their lives will be inside of that cell for the rest of their life. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=101.0s)]
*  They come out for a brief period of time to do a little bit of exercise. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=108.0s)]
*  And if they want, they can also see a preacher who comes in and helps with that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=112.0s)]
*  You looked at these guys eye to eye. What do you see? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, you see darkness and you don't see much hope left in their eyes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=121.0s)]
*  I had the opportunity to ask some of them, I asked them, are you guys still proud to be gangsters? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=126.0s)]
*  And some of them looked me in the eye and shook their head and said yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=131.0s)]
*  And others, as you could tell, were very remorseful. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah, what's your biggest takeaway? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=138.0s)]
*  These takeaways, probably I'm happy they're not on the streets. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=142.0s)]
*  Right. Were you at all concerned that perhaps some of them were there and shouldn't be there? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=147.0s)]
*  Maybe just got sent to the wrong place or not really? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=152.0s)]
*  Not really. I mean, you can see their tattoos on their chest. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=157.0s)]
*  If they have MS-13 or bario, GSO on their chest, it probably means they're in there for good reason. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=161.0s)]
*  And there is a process if they do believe they're innocent, they can then prove themselves in front of a judge as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=167.0s)]
*  Well, Nick, it's a fascinating story and you're lucky to have gotten the chance to see that up close. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=174.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=180.0s)]
*  Thank you. Let's go out of Salvador. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofSzcYA_pk&t=182.0s)]
