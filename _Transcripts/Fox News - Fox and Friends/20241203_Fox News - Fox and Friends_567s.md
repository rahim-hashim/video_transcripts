# Manchin calls on Biden to pardon Donald Trump: Make it 'balanced'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y)
*  The Department of Justice special counsel that guy right there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Actually, I thought it was a picture of David Weiss. That's hunter Biden [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=3.6s)]
*  He David Weiss says the motion to dismiss hunter Biden's indictment should be denied [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Maddie Rivera is in Washington. Hey, hey Maddie. Hi guys. Good morning [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=12.68s)]
*  Well hunter Biden's legal team wants automatic dismissal of the gun and tax cases and that's what special counsel [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=16.94s)]
*  David Weiss is taking issue with he does not deny that pardon that rather hunter received a pardon [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=23.0s)]
*  But he does say that a pardon does not absolve hunter of guilt [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=28.16s)]
*  Weiss says the president's pardon does not mean the grand jury's decision to charge him based on a finding of probable cause should be [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=32.0s)]
*  Wiped away as if it never occurred [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=38.44s)]
*  He goes on to say there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=40.72s)]
*  Directly contradicting the president's characterization of hunters indictments [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  No [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=50.959999999999994s)]
*  Read the president's statement seriously read the president's statement. He said he believes in the Department of Justice [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  He does he also believes that war politics infected the process and it led to a miscarriage of justice [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=58.32s)]
*  He believes his son was unfairly targeted. He said that what his political opponents have done to my son [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  That's his words is cruel and enough is enough [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=71.28s)]
*  In response hunters lawyer, Abby Lowell says the special counsel acknowledges that he is not guilty of a crime [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=74.56s)]
*  He says that the majority of courts when faced with such a decision have chosen to dismiss an indictment [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=80.8s)]
*  The special counsel's admission that this is the practice of the majority of courts certainly provides legal support to mr [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=86.32s)]
*  Biden's claim that dismissal is warranted Lowell argues a dismissal doesn't wipe away the indictment like it never happened [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=92.0s)]
*  It just means that the indictment has been resolved lauren steve ainsley and brian [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=98.72s)]
*  All right, maddie. Thank you very much [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=104.32s)]
*  Well, you know yesterday we spent most of our three hours talking about this yesterday joe mansion [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=106.32s)]
*  Popped up up over on cnn and he said well given the fact that joe biden said i'm never ever ever gonna [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=112.08s)]
*  Pardon my son and then did [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Manchin had this observation [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=120.72s)]
*  What I would have done differently in my recommendations the council would have been why don't you go ahead and pardon donald trump? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  For all his charges and make it, you know, it had been it had gone down a lot more balanced if you will [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=129.68s)]
*  I'm just saying wipe them out [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  No joe joe biden would have well he interviewed jonathan terry and jonathan brought up a good point [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=138.32s)]
*  He said he really doesn't need the pardon because he's some of the cases have already been dropped sentencing has been pushed back [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=142.55999999999997s)]
*  The federal case is exactly so he might not even need the the differences [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=148.72s)]
*  He was saying basically is that hunter biden definitely did these crimes and you know, you can pass to some of them [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  Yes, and it's been proven many people think that donald trump was targeted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=158.56s)]
*  By the democrats and by a liberal justice department. I mean he talks about taking a gun buying a gun taking the gun having his [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=162.72s)]
*  Bo's wife hailey, I think's hailey [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  Seeing the gun getting worried and throwing in a dumpster. So I mean the whole thing is there [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=174.8s)]
*  So to write a book and do a book tour and not acknowledge the laptop [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=178.56s)]
*  It just shows you how impervious this guy thought he was and he probably felt the same way going through the trial [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=181.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=186.8s)]
*  My dad is going to pardon me as elon musk tweeted out [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=188.08s)]
*  He says now who is above the law as chris whipple a best-selling author historian chief [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=191.52s)]
*  Aster wrote a book about chiefs of staff [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  He talked about the moral clarity of joe biden when he insisted he would not pardon hunter biden and now look how stupid they look [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=198.4s)]
*  And another biographer evan osnos of joe biden talked about his old school sense of duty [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=205.52s)]
*  Uh and doesn't abuse his power. How dumb do all these people look right now bry is not just that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=211.52s)]
*  It is the party that talks about privilege all the time [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=217.68s)]
*  And favors and how we need equity. Do you think anybody else? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=221.68s)]
*  Would have gotten this type of shake [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=226.96s)]
*  Uh out there if they went through like I I just don't understand a person so concerned about his legacy [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=229.36s)]
*  How he does he want this to be the legacy or or is he bruised by the democratic party because they forced him out? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  And he just doesn't care. He just wants to protect him and his family. The law is the law [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  He's allowed to pardon of course this you might not agree with it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=246.8s)]
*  But you can do it and donald trump might do it for you know [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=249.92s)]
*  Someone that he's close with and you know, the republicans can't say anything about it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=252.96s)]
*  He's allowed to do this. I think what i'm hearing on the network constantly yesterday at least is they're upset that he lied [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=256.96s)]
*  Why didn't he just say i'm gonna pardon my son? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=264.0s)]
*  We knew he was good. I don't know yet. Yeah, we knew that decision about that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=266.8s)]
*  But how many times do we hear joe biden say, you know [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=270.0s)]
*  When asked about different things with the department of justice and the attorney general he said, you know what? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=272.8s)]
*  That's an independent agency [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=278.24s)]
*  I'm not gonna meddle in it. Well, he just meddled in it and that is why david weiss is saying [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=281.28s)]
*  Oh joe biden says that this was selective prosecution. It absolutely was not and then he went through everything [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  Now it technically technically is up to those two judges one in california one in delaware whether or not they do dismiss [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=293.12s)]
*  The case if the president united states issues a pardon usually it's just a rubber stamp boom boom [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=300.4s)]
*  But technically it's still up to the judge. What do y'all think about them? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=305.52s)]
*  Blaming raw politics kjp blame. Well, we don't know exactly what she said. Why not blame him? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=309.76s)]
*  I mean he committed these crimes. He didn't pay his taxes more than a million dollars. He lied on a gun form [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=315.6s)]
*  Why why would it be politics? Well, he actually did these well, he's never experienced accountability. This family is a mess [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=321.84s)]
*  I mean they allow I mean [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=328.64s)]
*  Him to sleep around with his brother's dead wife not take care of his children [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean it's it's an entire mess that the president and the first lady has allowed him to get away with [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=335.52s)]
*  I mean, this was only the cherry on top. He's never had to deal with accountability. Is that because he lost his mom tragically? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=342.72s)]
*  There's a lot of you know what? Maybe maybe but there's a lot of people in america that have to deal with loss and grief [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  And addiction right? Do they don't have the president to rescue them though? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  And I just think this is just an sad example for the country. Yes [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  Stand with the people with addiction problems, but everyone with addiction problem doesn't display that type of thing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump is just like say look this way i've been telling you you the justice department's been weaponized [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=373.76s)]
*  To take action against me. You mocked me and said hey, we'll do our debate on wednesday [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=378.08s)]
*  That's your day off on the trial maybe we'll do it then trump's like yeah [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=382.4s)]
*  I'll debate you on a wednesday and he lost his career while he waited [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=386.08s)]
*  This is what that's why cash patel they've many people feel his uh, candidacy and his nomination been fortified [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=389.76s)]
*  Because now he's going to go in there the fbi and these investigations and he's going to fix it [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=396.32s)]
*  Oh, you have a problem with that because joe biden just says he had a problem [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=400.56s)]
*  That's the deal though bryan they they've so I had that talking point yesterday [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=403.76s)]
*  Okay, finally the democrats and republicans agree on this issue, but then when kjp was asked about it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=407.6s)]
*  She made it seem like it was just a hunter biden situation. You know what she said only one situation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  That the department of justice has been unfair and it's just hunter biden no other case allow me to portray what [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  He said yesterday on air force one. She said two things can be true [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=425.92s)]
*  You can believe in the doj system and you can believe that the process was [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=431.04s)]
*  Infected politically and so that is why you know joe biden's saying that's the his party line now [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=435.2s)]
*  Look, uh, those darn republicans. They came after me. Oh, look the darn doj came after me [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  It was selective but as the guy who did the prosecuting david wyse said [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=447.36s)]
*  Mr. President, I know you're my boss, but you're wrong [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=451.52s)]
*  Are you hearing anything behind the scenes about kjp's reaction to she was the one who was told say i'm not going to pardon [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=454.24s)]
*  I'm not going to pardon. Nope. I would think she would be upset [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=460.56s)]
*  Some of y'all have said she should have resigned when she found out he did on principle [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=463.44s)]
*  But she she just passes along the president's message. Well, she doesn't know if he's going to go back on his word [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, ultimately she asked him [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=473.2s)]
*  That's the way it's supposed to work. Okay as the mouthpiece for the president [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  What is your official position on this this and this and he tells her? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  Or they put it in the binder and then she repeats it [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  But the way she's been asked through history and he joe biden has been asked and everybody's been asked it was always an emphatic [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=488.16s)]
*  No, no, not gonna pardon not gonna pardon and then they lied. Here's the malpractice part [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=496.0s)]
*  The nbc report said that he had always intended on doing it [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=500.56s)]
*  So she kept the same talking point yesterday after the report was released and says oh no [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=505.04s)]
*  He came up with this over the weekend, but there's another report contradicting and saying this was always the point [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVU2a-4qf-Y&t=509.76s)]
