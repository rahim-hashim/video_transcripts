# House Republicans’ unity will face ‘real test’ in new Congress
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw)
*  So, President-elect Trump's victory is solidifying a massive political realignment around the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=0.0s)]
*  country in real time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=8.92s)]
*  But as we look at voter analysis and groups Kamala Harris did best with, including wealthy, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=10.78s)]
*  non-religious, and college-educated people, what does it tell you about the Democratic [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=16.2s)]
*  Party and why it's struggling? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=20.22s)]
*  Fox News contributor, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer joins us now to break [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  it down. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=25.92s)]
*  Really stunning, the realignment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=26.92s)]
*  You tweeted that out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=28.2s)]
*  The group she made the most progress with was? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=29.52s)]
*  Rich people, people who make more than $100,000 a year, people who say they have no religion, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=32.76s)]
*  she won them by 40 points, and people with post-graduate degrees. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  The base of the Democratic Party, Brian, is increasingly a rich, non-religious, super-educated [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=41.56s)]
*  group of Americans, and that's why they're struggling with Latinos and working-class [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=48.14s)]
*  Americans. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=51.96s)]
*  It's interesting, because you've been inside campaigns. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=52.96s)]
*  weren't they seeing this in real time? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=55.64s)]
*  And they still went out and booked Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=57.48s)]
*  And their whole focus on it's okay for men to compete against women in sports. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  They just do so many things that just rub against the grain of what America has always [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=65.96s)]
*  been and send every signal to working-class people, we don't care about you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=69.9s)]
*  We have an idea and elitism, an ideology about America that you don't fit into anymore, and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=74.0s)]
*  people feel it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Here is Jake Tapper talking about this comms issue that they're blaming it on. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=80.7s)]
*  It's all about communications. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=85.94s)]
*  What? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=87.34s)]
*  I just have to say, I've been doing this job now for many, many years, many, many decades, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=88.34s)]
*  and I have to say, it's always a comms issue, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=92.98s)]
*  It's never the record. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=96.66s)]
*  It's always they're just not communicating what they did effectively enough. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  The truth of the matter is, is that there was horrific inflation, and people had trouble [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  buying groceries. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=106.66s)]
*  And like for most Americans, a $400 problem is a big problem. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=107.66s)]
*  Yeah, America was on the wrong track. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=112.34s)]
*  People wanted change. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  This was a change election. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=116.62s)]
*  But what's interesting about that is, of course, it brought Trump to the White House. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=118.42s)]
*  It got the Senate to go Republican, but it didn't move a lot in the House. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=121.86s)]
*  Republicans still have to be wise about how big an agenda, how much of an agenda they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=126.14s)]
*  should push. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=129.74s)]
*  I think President Trump has an instinctive feel for that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=130.74s)]
*  But the House is going to go Republican, Brian, but it's going to go Republican with a very [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=133.84s)]
*  small margin. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=137.04s)]
*  It's going to be a real test of Republican unity. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=138.04s)]
*  Can they deliver for President Trump and the country? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=140.17999999999998s)]
*  Does it show you that the Trump popularity along with the agenda, it wasn't just the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=142.72s)]
*  agenda or the mistakes of the previous administration? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=147.04s)]
*  Trump got more than the Senate, did even better than the Senate and better than the House [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  indicated? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=154.84s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=155.84s)]
*  Presidents almost always lead the ticket, and that's what happened here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=156.84s)]
*  But because the President led the ticket, it enabled Republicans to pick up the seats [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  in the Senate that they did. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  The House remains very closely divided. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  All I'm saying is, Republicans need to be realistic. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=168.56s)]
*  How much unity will they have in the House? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=171.48s)]
*  All right, I want you to hear this exchange, because you used to have this job. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  And the premise was, we know KJP said, by the way, Donald Trump's a fascist, and the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=177.04s)]
*  world's over if he wins. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=185.44s)]
*  This administration message to millions of Americans that they're going to wake up the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=186.44s)]
*  day after the election if Trump won and have their rights stripped away, that democracy [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=191.56s)]
*  would crumble, and the President said today we're going to be OK. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=195.44s)]
*  So how do you swear that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=198.72s)]
*  I can't square that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=200.88s)]
*  There was an election two nights ago. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  There was. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=203.92s)]
*  And it was a free and fair election. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=205.8s)]
*  And we respect the election process. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Important. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=211.44s)]
*  For example, is the message to people who are fearful based on what the messaging was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=212.44s)]
*  about mistakes? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=217.64s)]
*  Well, now you're just twisting everything around, and that's really unfair. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=218.64s)]
*  No, it is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=221.76s)]
*  No, no, no, Jackie, it's unfair. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=222.76s)]
*  And she took her book and went home. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=225.56s)]
*  She actually left right after that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=227.32s)]
*  Well, a couple of points. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=228.52s)]
*  I mean, the question is a good question, because Kamala Harris called Donald Trump a fascist. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=229.52s)]
*  So if he's a fascist, how's everything OK? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=233.64s)]
*  As for her getting up and leaving, I was not allowed to leave the room until a senior wire [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=236.92s)]
*  reporter said thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=242.04s)]
*  It was up to the press how long I'd stay in the room. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=243.68s)]
*  I'm traditionalist. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=246.04s)]
*  I go by those old school rules. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=247.04s)]
*  I couldn't just pick up and go. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=248.76s)]
*  I would never have disrespected the press like that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=250.76s)]
*  You reacted to 9-11 attacks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=252.96s)]
*  The emotion was extremely high back then. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=253.96s)]
*  But it was a tradition. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=255.8s)]
*  The press secretary did not leave the podium until the senior wire reporter said thank [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=256.8s)]
*  you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=260.32s)]
*  That was decades long tradition. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=261.32s)]
*  I guess that's over with. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=262.32s)]
*  You liked President Biden's tone, though, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=263.6s)]
*  I liked his tone, but you know what? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=265.6s)]
*  It didn't matter to me, because the tone of the Democratic Party in 2017 when Trump came [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  in, that is not what they did. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  They ran the worst transition in the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=274.48s)]
*  They set Trump up in those briefings that then leaked to the press about the Steele [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=276.44s)]
*  dossier. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=279.72s)]
*  It was not a smooth transition from Obama to Trump because of the games they played [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=280.72s)]
*  that hurt Trump. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  And Joe Biden was in the room when they finally hatched that plan. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  I tried to end up beating up but it couldn't. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=291.36s)]
*  It was great to see you, Ari. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=293.36s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQlgZAqCaw&t=294.36s)]
