# Ex-DHS chief slams sanctuary cities for sheltering criminal migrants #foxnews #shorts #immigration
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU)
*  It's incredible that, again, time after time after time, that local officials are not working [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=0.0s)]
*  with ICE as these detainers come in or as these individuals come into their system to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=5.64s)]
*  want them out of their communities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=10.92s)]
*  I mean, these are dangerous individuals. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=12.4s)]
*  And all they have to do is allow ICE to come in, and they will remove these individuals [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=15.0s)]
*  out of the communities. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=19.06s)]
*  And what a lot of these officials will try to tell their constituents and tell the American [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=20.06s)]
*  people is, we want to be welcoming to migrants. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=24.36s)]
*  We want to be welcoming. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=26.72s)]
*  It places fear into our community. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=28.52s)]
*  And nothing could be further from the truth, because what you're actually doing is making [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  your community more unsafe and allowing these individuals to stay there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  They are dangerous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=41.12s)]
*  If you have someone in your community that has been arrested for a terrorism charge, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=42.12s)]
*  my guess is that the majority of folks there want them out of their community. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0RHHcfJpU&t=46.84s)]
