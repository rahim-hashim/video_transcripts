# Trump rips ABC for 'rigged' debate: 'It was three-to-one'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40)
*  Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris squaring off on the debate stage last night meeting face-to-face for the very first time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a heated debate less than two months until election day [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=8.0s)]
*  Joining us right now on the phone to react after that very busy night the 45th president United States to the European presidential nominee [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=12.5s)]
*  Donald Trump mr. President. How do you feel about the night 105 minutes long? You've done this before [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=19.16s)]
*  I think your eighth one. What is your review of your of your performance? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=25.26s)]
*  I looked at the poll numbers. I listened to Harold Ford. I don't know what he was watching [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=30.08s)]
*  Because I think he wasn't watching the debate that I was in yesterday. I think we did great [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=34.64s)]
*  It was three to one [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=39.42s)]
*  it was a rigged a deal as as I assumed it would be because when you looked at the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=40.6s)]
*  the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  We knew it when it was a hundred percent good coverage for her over the last month or last year [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=51.16s)]
*  I looked at it and only bad coverage of me no matter what the press is so dishonest in this country [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  It's amazing now. I didn't mind it because frankly I knew that I was pretty sure that's what they would do [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=64.12s)]
*  CNN was much more honorable the debate we had with Biden was a much more honorably run debate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=69.86s)]
*  But this was incredible. I mean everything so many things I said would debunked totally debunked like Charlottesville [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=76.2s)]
*  Like I could I have a list of seven different things and she could say anything she wanted everything every time I spoke and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=84.28s)]
*  My stuff was right. They'd correct you. I thought it was terrible from the standpoint of ABC [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  They're the most dishonest in my opinion the most dishonest news organization and that's saying a lot because they're all essentially [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Really dishonest, but I thought I did a great job. It was three on one [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=106.4s)]
*  And I thought I did a great job now [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=110.98s)]
*  I we sent you the polls but every single poll last night had me winning like 90 to 10 we had [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=112.9s)]
*  C-SPAN at one point was at 80 to 20 and I don't know how it finished [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=120.94s)]
*  That was late last night. So I have no idea but it was at 80 to 20. I told that to Brett Baer and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=125.18s)]
*  So we sent him a lot of polls and we said you a lot of polls this morning and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=131.3s)]
*  Every single poll had us winning by a lot despite the fact that it was an unfair debate obviously and it was [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=135.26s)]
*  It was a three-on-one and I that's okay. I've had worse odds in my life [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=141.54s)]
*  I've had it before but never so obvious a lot of people are very angry about it, you know, you have corrupt news organizations [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=146.02s)]
*  You have a lot of bad people. It's amazing in that business in your business [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=153.62s)]
*  Yeah, mr. President. We kind of expected it because when you look at media research center [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=158.94s)]
*  They said 100% of the stories covered on ABC about Kamala 100% of the time was positive [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=163.56s)]
*  93% of the time when they covered you it was negative [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=171.36s)]
*  So it was infuriating to watch them fact-check you and not her when she brought up IVF when she brought up project [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=174.56s)]
*  2025 several times and when she brought up Charlottesville here are some of the lies that she said about you. Listen [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  The detailed and dangerous plan called project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=188.02s)]
*  couples who pray and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  and and and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments if [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump were to be reelected [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  He will sign a national abortion ban and what did the president then at the time say? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=205.46s)]
*  There were fine people on each side on that day [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=211.34s)]
*  140 law enforcement officers were injured and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=215.34s)]
*  Some died Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=218.14s)]
*  There will be a bloodbath if this and the outcome of this election is not to his liking [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=222.62s)]
*  And the bloodbath you were talking about the economy. It's a term that's used a lot when people are talking about a bad economy [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=227.9s)]
*  What's your reaction to why didn't the moderators correct her? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=234.56s)]
*  Because they're dishonest and because I think ABC took a big hit last night [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=237.98s)]
*  I mean to be honest, they're a news organization. They have to be licensed to do it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=242.42s)]
*  They ought to take away their license for the way they did that bloodbath was referring to the economy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=247.18s)]
*  Everybody loved the term because as soon as they heard the word it's sort of a vicious word [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=253.18s)]
*  But referring to the economy that they have created an economy bloodbath was the word that I used and it was fine in that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=257.42s)]
*  Context and they were trying to make it sound like there was a riot or something and it was a bloodbath IVF [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=265.7s)]
*  I was a leader on IEF the IVF the IVF which is fertilization [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=271.18s)]
*  I was a total leader on that when I first heard about it like right from the beginning [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=276.54s)]
*  I was one of the leaders on it and the Republican Party has been a leader on it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=281.26s)]
*  She tried to say it was just the opposite [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=285.82s)]
*  the the whole thing with [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=288.22s)]
*  Abortion what he said, I mean it was incredible. I think he corrected me six times and each time I was right [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=290.9s)]
*  I believe each time I was right didn't correct her at all and she was saying these things [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=297.74s)]
*  She was using like Charlottesville. She was using Charlottesville and everybody you take a look at Laura Ingraham [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=303.9s)]
*  She did it incredibly. She had it totally debunked. She said that in fact, it makes it angry [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  She makes she gets angry when people hear about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=316.38s)]
*  Charlottesville when they use that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  Because what they did is they stopped and they didn't put the following sentence in and when they put the last sentence [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=322.06s)]
*  In when it was all put together what I said was absolutely perfect and ABC knew that everybody knew that frankly [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  I think they lost a lot of credibility. But regardless [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=334.38s)]
*  Look, the polls are saying that I was I won that by 80 20 90. Here's we have one here [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=338.06s)]
*  92 to 7 and I sort of believe that's right. I thought look I've been told I'm a good debater [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=345.32s)]
*  I think it was one of my better debates. Maybe my best debate. I think I don't know [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  That's why i'm disappointed in this guy harold ford [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=355.26s)]
*  I don't know if he's still there [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=358.22s)]
*  But I don't know what he was watching because he was just as dishonest as ABC in my opinion. Mr. President [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=359.58000000000004s)]
*  I interrupted a moment ago. They just on the face of the pentagon [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=366.14s)]
*  Every year for the last 23 years, we have gone down to the pentagon at 6 46 that sunrise [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=371.02000000000004s)]
*  Down in the washington dc area when they unfurled that flag [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=377.42s)]
*  to commemorate [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=382.54s)]
*  American Airlines flight 77 that crashed into the pentagon. It killed all 64 on board [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=384.38s)]
*  125 people at the pentagon [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=390.04s)]
*  184 people lost their lives [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=393.56s)]
*  23 years ago today and I know [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=396.92s)]
*  I know you are going to take part in some of the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=400.38s)]
*  Commemorations as well here in new york city and in pennsylvania [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=403.4s)]

*  I'm going down to the world trade center site and i'll be down there for [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=411.74s)]
*  Much of it jd's going with me [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=415.9s)]
*  And we had uh, we had a great talk about it yesterday. It was very very sad horrible day [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=418.38s)]
*  Horrible day. There's never been anything like it just a horrible day and then going to pennsylvania, of course [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=424.53999999999996s)]
*  And so i'm going to be doing both of them. Sometimes i'll do all three [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=429.5s)]
*  Sometimes it doesn't work out when they're sort of simultaneously done, but we're going to be doing two of them today [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=433.5s)]

*  Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure it's you know, look [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=453.34s)]
*  Everybody should be very angry at how badly they've run this country [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=457.74s)]
*  Millions of people are floating into our country. Many of them should not be here [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=461.9s)]
*  They're criminals many criminals coming in many terrors coming in people coming they're emptying their jails into our country [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=466.53999999999996s)]

*  How can you say it too much they've allowed 21 million I think is the real number it could be more than that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=521.34s)]
*  21 that's bigger than new york state [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=527.26s)]
*  They've allowed 21 million people come into it to come into our country [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=529.26s)]
*  Many of these people are criminals and by the way [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=533.42s)]
*  Those countries are being emptied out of their criminals and their crime rates are way down [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=536.3s)]
*  Their prison populations are being dumped into the united states their populations in prison are way down [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtvhFTLso40&t=541.1s)]
