# Israeli woman: We have no proof of life
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk)
*  Alright, we have a Fox News alert new information just in the IDF says over the last hour three explosive devices were detonated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=0.0s)]
*  near IDF troops in two different locations in the northern Gaza Strip violating the framework of the operational pause in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=7.48s)]
*  One of those locations terrorists also opened fire at the troops who responded with fire a number of soldiers were lightly injured [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=15.6s)]
*  That's all as desperate Israelis [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=23.88s)]
*  Hope their loved ones will be in the next round of hostages to come home today including our next guest whose aunt [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=25.96s)]
*  Three cousins and two of them just three and five years old were finally released on Friday [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=32.8s)]
*  But it is far from over as her 80 year old uncle still remains among some of the 200 hostages still held by Hamas [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=38.64s)]
*  terrorists [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=46.44s)]
*  Efrat joins us now from Israel. Thank you so much for coming on again [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  And thank you very much. You're welcome enough and keeping the story up in the news, of course [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=52.08s)]
*  we're praying for Israel and we're just [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=58.04s)]
*  So sad for what y'all have all gone through you had four family members that were taken your 79 year old aunt and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=61.04s)]
*  Cousins a 34 year old a three year old and a five year old [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=69.12s)]
*  But in addition to those four you had another family member your uncle and what do you know about him at this point? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=72.12s)]
*  So [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=78.04s)]
*  As of October 7th, we have absolutely no proof of life [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  we have no idea it has been two months already and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=86.12s)]
*  Like us many other families. We have no idea and it's just really [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=92.12s)]
*  So tragic and to think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=98.4s)]
*  We are in a global world in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=101.68s)]
*  2023 [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Are still in such state. It's just really devastating. It's hard to believe that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=106.28s)]
*  nowhere [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=113.08s)]
*  we can find [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=114.28s)]
*  assistant of global [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=116.2s)]
*  Institutions like the UN or the Red Cross or anyone anyone that could [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=118.52s)]
*  Help with a proof of life. Yeah [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  It's not only about the proof of life now, you know, it has been two months [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=127.32s)]
*  We have been communicating for quite a long time right now, which I think for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=131.44s)]
*  And you know with all the chronically ill and we have so many [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=137.04s)]
*  So many of them in the group of their about 160 still being kidnapped [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=142.24s)]
*  Medicine is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=149.44s)]
*  Something they have to have now today because as we speak their lives are fading [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=150.88s)]
*  Efra how how's your aunt doing? How are your cousins doing? Have you talked to them since they have been released? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I am. I haven't talked to the one yet [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  But I did it with my aunt and I have to tell you that hug was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=168.55999999999997s)]
*  a precious moment for us [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=173.6s)]
*  um, she's amazing. She is really um, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  Erohean she is she's so [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  Brave and so strong not in body but in spirit [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=183.92s)]
*  And I think she is an inspiration to all of us [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=188.72s)]
*  Of how kind she was through all this time. We know [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=193.2s)]
*  She helped many people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  around her [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  It was very difficult for all the elderly's to get up from the thin mattress [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=202.72s)]
*  They had on the floor so she would help them pick up help picking them up [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=208.16s)]
*  And she helped a little bit with the little food they had with distribution [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=213.84s)]
*  And she was trying to keep up the good spirit with the people that shared a space with her [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  down in the tunnels and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=225.6s)]
*  I think that this is a victory of the spirit and I think we can all learn a good lesson [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=227.68s)]
*  We don't have to be very masculine or have any superpowers [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=235.36s)]
*  We can be ourselves when we [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=239.7s)]
*  Are at our best when we're connected to all the morals we and the education we got and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=242.66s)]
*  to the power of of hope [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=248.18s)]
*  And we're very very lucky and grateful to have her back. This is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=250.9s)]
*  Extraordinary and have the one and the kids but really, you know with my uncle missing still [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=256.32s)]
*  It's hard. So the happiness and joy is really [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=263.38s)]
*  A mixed feeling it's it's hard [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=267.22s)]
*  it's hard to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=270.66s)]
*  I'll show him again. Yeah, I love that picture of him and we can all relate to that. He's wearing his button-down shirt [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=273.14s)]
*  Um, you know about my dad's age has his glass of wine his red wine that he probably enjoys [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=279.14s)]
*  Just the red wine by the way is his own wine [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=284.74s)]
*  Oh, he he makes it. I remember you telling us that that's right. All right. Well, everyone say a prayer for him. What is his first name? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=288.74s)]
*  His name is gadi gadi mozes g-a-d-i gadi mozes [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  And really all the rest, you know the elderly the chronically ill [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=302.34s)]
*  I think all governments and I really do hope in america as well people will push [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=306.9s)]
*  For his release and all the chronically ill they're losing time. There is no time [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=312.5s)]
*  Tomorrow they might be dead [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=318.34s)]
*  They're in really critical conditions and as I said lives are fading there isn't time they have to be back home [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=320.58s)]
*  Efrat, thank you so much. We are praying for you for gadi and for all the other hostages and their families [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p6c14K7Nk&t=328.97999999999996s)]
