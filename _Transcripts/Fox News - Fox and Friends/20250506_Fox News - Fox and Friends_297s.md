# NEW: Israel strikes Yemen's port city as it plans 'intensive' Gaza operation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ)
*  Israel striking targets in Yemen for the first time in months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  One day after the Houthis fired a ballistic missile that beat all their missile defense [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=5.5s)]
*  and landed in the Israel's main airport in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=9.5s)]
*  This is Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that Israel will ramp up operations in Gaza [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=13.46s)]
*  aimed at defeating Hamas once and for all and freeing all remaining hostages, not only [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=18.82s)]
*  taking land but holding it in Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=23.98s)]
*  State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=28.48s)]
*  Tammy, great to see you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=31.86s)]
*  Hey Brian. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=33.76s)]
*  Yeah, same here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=34.76s)]
*  Your reaction, with the U.S. reaction to hitting the Houthi rebels who we've been hitting now [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=35.76s)]
*  for I think 15 straight days. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=39.52s)]
*  Those strikes were expected, wouldn't you think? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=42.68s)]
*  Well I think so. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=46.88s)]
*  I mean clearly the United States, the President, the Department of Defense, Secretary Rubio [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=48.6s)]
*  here at the State Department have made it clear that what the Houthis have been doing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=53.36s)]
*  when it comes to certainly the shipping lanes, the attacks on our ships, hundreds on commercial [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=57.94s)]
*  ships, on our military ships as well, that this will not stand. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=63.38s)]
*  And we have struck them, we've made it clear that it was not a pinprick dynamic and things [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=68.02s)]
*  go back to normal, that we intend to stop them and their efforts to constrain, not just [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=72.76s)]
*  constrain shipping through the Red Sea, but in attacking innocent vessels, innocent countries, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=78.26s)]
*  And we saw that also with the attack on Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=84.82s)]
*  At the same time, we know of course that Israel, one of our, if not most staunch allies, that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  we stand with them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=94.38s)]
*  We, of course, after the October 7th massacre, they have every right, as they always do, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=95.5s)]
*  to defend themselves and defending themselves against Tamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=100.86s)]
*  part of that mechanism. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=106.38s)]
*  Does the State Department, in support of the new policy with Israel, not only they've [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=107.38s)]
*  called up their reserves, they plan on going into Gaza and not only clearing land, but [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=113.58000000000001s)]
*  holding land and taking more with each time that, each day that passes without release [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=118.98s)]
*  of the hostages, are we in support of that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=124.42s)]
*  Well, I will not speak to, of course, the actions or decisions of a different government, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=127.14s)]
*  but what I can tell you is what the United States has said repeatedly and what Marco [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  Rubio has said is that Hamas cannot exist, that the only way forward for Gaza, and the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=138.1s)]
*  president has noted this as well, that Hamas must not exist within the framework of anything. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=143.94s)]
*  They've got to be obliterated and that every single hostage, and there are still several [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=150.1s)]
*  Americans, including Edan Alexander, who are being held by those monsters, that all the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=154.42s)]
*  hostages must be released. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=160.34s)]
*  This is something that Hamas has generally ignored and Israel is going to do clearly [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=162.9s)]
*  what it feels is necessary for their own defense and we stand by our ally and we understand, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=168.18s)]
*  of course, the nature of their reaction to Yemen and that missile attack, all within [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  a self-defense framework. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=178.66s)]
*  But Hamas cannot continue to exist. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=180.06s)]
*  All the hostages have got to be released. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=183.06s)]
*  The United States has been clear on that and forceful and that has not changed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  All right, so let's talk about the president's conversation with the prime minister of Turkey, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=189.5s)]
*  Erdogan, who the president has known even before he became president. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=194.14s)]
*  They said they have a productive conversation and they want to work together to bring an [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  end to the fighting with Ukraine and Russia, although both sides, and we'll see video, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=201.5s)]
*  were hitting each other with drone strikes last night and the fighting continues to rage. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  What role could Turkey play in all this? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=211.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, the president has an amazing ability to have good relationships and an [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=214.78s)]
*  interest in meeting with and speaking with everyone. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=220.06s)]
*  The previous administration, as an example, didn't talk to Russia for three years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=222.54s)]
*  That's no way to handle a nuclear power or to be able to exercise any kind of influence [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=226.62s)]
*  or persuasion. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  The president's comments with Erdogan, of course, are between him and that leader, but [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=233.66s)]
*  he did say that they were productive, as you noted, that they look forward to having more [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=239.74s)]
*  visits and that what they discussed included every hot spot that's in the world. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  I would expect that President Trump, in his effort to have peace around the world and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=251.66000000000003s)]
*  to end these meat grinder massacre wars that are happening, is being able to work with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  Turkey, work with other nations to make that happen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=263.1s)]
*  Clearly, the president seemed pleased and that's good for us and it's good for people [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=267.26s)]
*  who want war in that region to end. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=271.42s)]
*  All right, Tavie Bruce, thanks so much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=273.66s)]
*  We look forward to finding out where talks go with Iran, where talks go with Russia and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=275.18s)]
*  Ukraine, and where talks go with Hamas and Israel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=279.82s)]
*  A lot on your plate. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=282.94s)]
*  Thanks so much, Tavie. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=283.9s)]
*  It's all good news. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=284.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=286.14s)]
*  you [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi50ItLuxHQ&t=296.62s)]
