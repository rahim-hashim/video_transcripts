# 'This is all she has left': Kamala Harris under fire for 'divisive' closing address
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc)
*  Meanwhile, the Vice President Kamala Harris, not holding back in her closing argument to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=0.0s)]
*  voters last night on the ellipse, and ramped up the rhetoric against Donald Trump as the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  former president calls out the Democrats' tactics. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Watch both of them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=13.3s)]
*  This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=14.3s)]
*  out for unchecked power. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  We are not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=25.64s)]
*  The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that everyone who isn't voting for her [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=30.92s)]
*  is a Nazi. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=35.96s)]
*  I'm running a campaign of solutions to save our country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=37.2s)]
*  Kamala is running a campaign of demonization and hate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=43.56s)]
*  Well here to discuss New York Post columnist Miranda Devine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=50.32s)]
*  Miranda, good morning to you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=54.16s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=57.08s)]
*  We've heard all those comments that we just put in the soundbite montage right there before, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=58.56s)]
*  but it seems to be coordinated because what they're trying to do is they're trying to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=65.56s)]
*  say Donald Trump is a bad guy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=68.48s)]
*  He's a, you know, he's a fascist. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=70.24s)]
*  We heard that regarding the rally and stuff like that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=72.68s)]
*  Why do they think that that is a potent message in the last six days before the election? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=76.8s)]
*  Well, I can only assume that they are desperate and all they have left is demonization of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=83.44s)]
*  Donald Trump and all his supporters too. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=91.28s)]
*  You know, if they just confined it to Donald Trump, I don't think it would be as damaging [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=94.44s)]
*  to them as a campaign. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=97.92s)]
*  But they seem to really, the top people, Kamala Harris, Tim Waltz, Joe Biden, seem to have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=100.12s)]
*  a real dislike for half the country who the polls are showing are voting for Trump. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  We had Joe Biden, while Kamala Harris was out on the ellipse giving her speech, we have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=115.16s)]
*  Joe Biden on CNN calling Trump supporters garbage. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=120.52s)]
*  We had Tim Waltz over the weekend calling them Nazis, likening the Madison Square Garden [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=126.04s)]
*  rally full of tens of thousands of good people, calling that the equivalent of a Nazi rally [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=132.4s)]
*  from 1939. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=139.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris herself has said outright that Trump is a fascist. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=141.52s)]
*  So all of this put together tells me that they have nothing positive to run on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  She said last night that she was about unity. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  We heard that from Joe Biden back in 2020 and he was the most divisive president, I [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=156.0s)]
*  think, in living memory. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=162.44s)]
*  Well, you know, it's a unique situation because normally everybody six months ago thought [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  that Joe Biden would be running, but because of we know why, he's not. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=169.24s)]
*  And so she essentially is the heir apparent and she's extending his second Biden 2.0. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=173.88000000000002s)]
*  The problem is, and maybe this is part of it, Miranda, is the fact that she's talking [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  about all these other things, fascism and stuff like that, because you can't run on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=185.24s)]
*  your record when you look at some of the greatest hits for the Biden Harris administration. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=188.68s)]
*  You know, Abbey Gate killed 13 U.S. soldiers, the border crisis, two million gotaways, millions [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=193.96s)]
*  others in the country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=201.88s)]
*  And the last one, the thing that impacts us every time we buy something, everything is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=202.96s)]
*  at least 20 percent more than it was back in the day. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=207.44s)]
*  They can't run on, hey, you want high prices for another four years? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=211.0s)]
*  Well, for me, you can't do that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=215.88s)]
*  So you do something else. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=217.44s)]
*  Well, she's tied at the hip to Bidenomics and every other disastrous policy of the Biden [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=219.44s)]
*  Harris administration. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=227.72s)]
*  And she was the border czar. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=229.48s)]
*  So she's actually responsible for the tens of millions of people that have come over [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=231.02s)]
*  the border. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=237.4s)]
*  So I think she's trying to say that she's forging a different path. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=238.4s)]
*  She's never disavowed any of the policies or disasters. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=243.44s)]
*  So she's stuck with it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=247.72s)]
*  OK. I know you're coming out with a column tonight about just this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PplzQ9yqQYc&t=249.20000000000002s)]
