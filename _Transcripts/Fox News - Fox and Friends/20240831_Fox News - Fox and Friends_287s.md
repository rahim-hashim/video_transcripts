# 'WE'RE NOT STUPID': CEO sounds off on Harris' fracking flip-flop
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U)
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=0.0s)]
*  I would not ban fracking. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=2.5s)]
*  As vice president, I did not ban fracking. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=4.64s)]
*  As president, I will not ban fracking. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=7.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris appearing to make, not appearing, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=9.88s)]
*  she makes a complete U-turn on energy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=12.14s)]
*  And President Trump is not gonna let it slide [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=15.34s)]
*  in the Keystone State. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=17.54s)]
*  Then they start playing clips. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=19.52s)]
*  We will always ban fracking. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=21.66s)]
*  There will never be fracking. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=23.46s)]
*  The people of Pennsylvania are smart. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=26.52s)]
*  They're not gonna fall for it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=29.54s)]
*  We were energy independent four years ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=31.02s)]
*  Look what happened. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=33.78s)]
*  We're energy, we're gonna be energy dominant very soon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=34.72s)]
*  Bill Polichek is the president and CEO of JWF Industries, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=38.42s)]
*  who also spoke at Trump's rally in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=42.72s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=45.7s)]
*  Bill, thanks for being here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=47.54s)]
*  Kamala Harris is counting on the fact [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=49.36s)]
*  that she can hoodwink people, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=50.96s)]
*  that she can say, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=52.04s)]
*  well, I may have said that before, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=53.34s)]
*  but I don't believe that today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=54.54s)]
*  For folks in Pennsylvania who are involved in this industry [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=55.94s)]
*  or around that in the industrial base [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=58.86000000000001s)]
*  and manufacturing, which you are, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=61.06s)]
*  how do they feel about what Kamala Harris would actually do? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, first of all, we're not stupid, number one. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=67.74000000000001s)]
*  And you can't say something 10 times [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=70.38000000000001s)]
*  and then say something different 11th time [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=72.98s)]
*  and we think, oh, 11th time's the actual truth. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=75.34s)]
*  We know Dan well, she's far left. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=77.88s)]
*  We know that she's very liberal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=80.26s)]
*  They're against any fracking. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  And the sad part is our cost, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=84.22s)]
*  since Donald Trump has been out of office, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  our energy cost has gone up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Our jobs have gone down in the fracking industry. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  It was a wonderful thing where you had a fracking industry [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=95.08s)]
*  that was robust. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=99.32s)]
*  It created jobs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=100.61999999999999s)]
*  It brought our utility costs down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=101.82s)]
*  It brought our gas prices down into our homes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=104.1s)]
*  It's just ridiculous to think the average American, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=107.52s)]
*  the average Pennsylvania is stupid [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=110.6s)]
*  and they're gonna think, oh, all of a sudden now she's left. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=112.35999999999999s)]
*  Bill, we know the race to the White House [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  goes through Pennsylvania. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=118.22s)]
*  We hear about this issue of fracking. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  How significant is horizontal fracture in Pennsylvania? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  Is this a small issue or is this really something [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=126.96s)]
*  that people resonate with? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  No, it's a very big issue [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=132.0s)]
*  and I think it affects everybody across the state. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=133.04s)]
*  It affects obviously the people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=136.14s)]
*  that are working in that industry. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=138.88s)]
*  It affects the price of the pump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=140.14s)]
*  It affects the gas prices at your home. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=142.38s)]
*  It affects my cost of manufacture. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=146.12s)]
*  And of course we build things in the oil and gas industry. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=149.36s)]
*  We haven't had an order since six months [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=152.86s)]
*  since Biden and Harris took over office. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=156.54s)]
*  It's just to the point where you're hurting manufacturing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=161.08s)]
*  She says she wants to help manufacturing, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=162.9s)]
*  help the middle class. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=165.54s)]
*  It's the exact opposite. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=166.7s)]
*  That's who the hell it is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=167.82s)]
*  It's the middle class that she's affecting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=168.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's all duplicitous. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=172.28s)]
*  I mean, their policies for three and a half years [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=173.56s)]
*  crack down on your industries [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=176.66s)]
*  and then suddenly they talk about how they wanna help you [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=178.2s)]
*  or they wanna address inflation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  Speaking of inflation, by the way, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=182.28s)]
*  your Senate candidate there, Dave McCormick, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=183.48s)]
*  put out a couple of graphics or information [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  about the cost of things in Pennsylvania, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  which are that much more expensive. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=191.17999999999998s)]
*  Let me know, is this your experience? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=193.32s)]
*  So if you want a six inch hoagie from Wawa, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=194.83999999999997s)]
*  it's almost doubled from 2019 to 2024. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=197.6s)]
*  If you want a beer at a Phillies game [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=200.72s)]
*  or a Pittsburgh Steelers game, I can see you're a fan. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=202.4s)]
*  It's up by a buck 70. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=205.32s)]
*  And a cheesesteak up almost two and a half bucks. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=207.6s)]
*  Is this your experience too? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  Are people voting on this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=216.0s)]
*  When the average Pennsylvania lives paycheck to paycheck [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=216.84s)]
*  and they see these prices, they go to the grocery store [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=222.76s)]
*  and now they've gotta decide what they're gonna buy, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=225.32s)]
*  what type of groceries. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=228.68s)]
*  Or maybe some of the senior citizens [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=229.68s)]
*  now are deciding whether they can afford their medicine [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=231.78s)]
*  or pay for food. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=234.22s)]
*  I mean, it's the ability to whether you can live [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=235.98s)]
*  and it's just gotten ridiculous. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=240.14s)]
*  Yes, we see that same thing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=241.58s)]
*  And not to mention, go buy a hamburger today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=242.94s)]
*  It's up 50%. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=245.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=246.98s)]
*  Yeah, and then they wanna- [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=248.06s)]
*  And she says it's 3% increase. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=248.9s)]
*  She's bragging about the, it's only 3% more. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=252.06s)]
*  That's over the 20% that they've already increased [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=255.46s)]
*  with inflation, so it's ridiculous. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=258.74s)]
*  Correct, we brought inflation down to 3%. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=260.18s)]
*  Well, what about the 40% I see in all my other items [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=262.06s)]
*  in the grocery store, which we all experience? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=264.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=266.86s)]
*  Bill, thank you and good luck to Russell Wilson [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=267.7s)]
*  and your squad this year. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=270.3s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=271.5s)]
*  Yeah, we hope he's their favorite player. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  Hey, he's done it before, we'll see. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6v4Wv0n57U&t=273.90000000000003s)]
