# Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow during Groundhog Day prediction
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw)
*  So we've got some breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the moment we've all been waiting for. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=1.24s)]
*  Here is Puxatani Phil. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=3.46s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=5.48s)]
*  The [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=6.52s)]
*  Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=66.52s)]
*  Now on this February 2nd, Patsutani Phil, the seer of seers, the prognosticator of all [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=68.52s)]
*  prognosticators, was awakened from his wintry nap at dawn on Gobbler's Nile. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=77.72s)]
*  Phil looked to the skies and then, speaking in groundhogese, directed the President to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=84.52s)]
*  the proper scroll which reads, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  What a way to start a Sunday fun day. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=95.4s)]
*  You always said you'd make it here one day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  To this place barely big enough to contain ya, to this sweet Patsutani Pennsylvania. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  We're all here with the elements combined, where Mother Nature meets Father Time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=116.76s)]
*  To hear the truth, are those gray skies? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=123.92s)]
*  Only I know you can't trust AI. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=127.68s)]
*  It's Groundhog Day and maybe life is on the loop, but I miss my burrow, I miss my coop. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=133.68s)]
*  So I'm headed back down. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=143.44s)]
*  There's a shadow up here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=146.16s)]
*  Get ready for four weeks of retro high school. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=148.16s)]
*  Six more weeks! [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=153.92s)]
*  Six more weeks! [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=157.92s)]
*  Six more weeks! [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=161.92s)]
*  Six more weeks! [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=165.92s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=173.92s)]
*  Six more weeks of winter and I'm not surprised to be honest with you because this groundhog [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=175.92s)]
*  has predicted an early spring two years in a row, but what a day. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=180.92s)]
*  I mean, I think we've had 50,000 people here at Gobbler's Knob and Charlie, I will tell [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=185.92s)]
*  you, they're already starting to exit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=189.92s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=191.92s)]
*  Within minutes, Gobbler's Knob is going to be completely empty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=192.92s)]
*  But I will tell you, it's one of the best events that I have ever covered. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=197.92s)]
*  It doesn't matter who you voted for, it doesn't matter how much money you make, you're all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=201.92s)]
*  here to watch a groundhog and that's really special. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=204.92s)]
*  That's all about America, my friend. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=208.92s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=210.92s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=211.92s)]
*  When you put your head down, you look exactly like Puxitani Phil. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=212.92s)]
*  It's very impressive. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=217.92s)]
*  There it is right there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=218.92s)]
*  Bow to the groundhog. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=220.92s)]
*  Mother Nature meets Father Time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgmBKv0qXAw&t=222.92s)]
