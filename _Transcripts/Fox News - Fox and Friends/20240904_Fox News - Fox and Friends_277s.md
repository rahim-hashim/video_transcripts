# Baseball team, families left in shock after migrant's arrest for stabbing girl
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE)
*  An illegal immigrant from Honduras is now behind bars after a massive manhunt in Indiana. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=0.0s)]
*  Demas Gabrielle Yanez is accused of stabbing a 14-year-old girl while she was attending [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=6.2s)]
*  her younger brother's baseball game. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=12.4s)]
*  The suspect was deported in 2018 and is linked to several other crimes across the United [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=14.64s)]
*  States. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=19.48s)]
*  Matt Ramian was coaching the brother's baseball team. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=20.48s)]
*  He was on third base with a player and he saw the whole thing and joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=23.94s)]
*  Good morning to you, Matt. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=27.96s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=28.96s)]
*  Thanks for what you do for the kids. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=29.96s)]
*  Yeah, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=30.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=31.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=32.96s)]
*  So tell us what happened. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=33.96s)]
*  What did you see? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=34.96s)]
*  Well, I was just coaching a baseball game like I pretty much do all the time and I'm [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=35.96s)]
*  on third base. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=41.96s)]
*  I looked to talk to my on deck batter and out of the corner of my eye I see this dude [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=42.96s)]
*  just come out of behind my dugout and all he did was just jump on this girl and then [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=48.24s)]
*  to like push her down onto the bleachers and then he pulls out at least a 16 to 20 inch [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=55.52s)]
*  knife. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't even a regular sized pocket knife and just started swinging it and got her a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  few times and blood went all over the bleachers and on the people sitting in front of them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=66.12s)]
*  Then he just takes off running down the sidelines and started waving the knife at a couple other [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=71.48s)]
*  people as he was running. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=76.84s)]
*  And then a bunch of the dads, at least like 10 to 15 dads just go running after the guy [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  and chased them all through the woods and then like a 26 hour manhunt proceeded. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=83.74s)]
*  My goodness. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=89.74s)]
*  I mean, we see behind you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=90.74s)]
*  It's a field. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=92.16s)]
*  This is an all American thing that we all do this on a Saturday. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=93.22s)]
*  We go to our siblings baseball games. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=96.58s)]
*  You don't expect crime to happen there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=98.58s)]
*  Why in Indiana is this happening? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=100.94s)]
*  That's the question everyone's been asking. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=105.1s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's a small town. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=106.82s)]
*  I mean, Lowell is one of those little close-knit towns. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=108.62s)]
*  They have a big Labor Day weekend like festivals. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=111.9s)]
*  They have a music festival. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  They have fireworks shows, parades, every day something different. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's one of those towns where everybody knows everybody. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=119.98s)]
*  So, I mean, for something like this to happen was shocking just not for Lowell, but for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=123.26s)]
*  all the communities around them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=129.66s)]
*  What are they saying about this illegal migrant? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=131.5s)]
*  Was he on drugs? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=134.1s)]
*  What would make him just run and jump on this this young girl? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=135.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's the million dollar question. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=138.86s)]
*  Nobody has an answer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=140.54s)]
*  You know, the detectives and I think now it's in the DEA's hands. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=141.94s)]
*  So they're, you know, investigating every possibility on who, what, where and why. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=145.02s)]
*  I mean, the last I heard is he just took a train from Colorado and ended up in Indiana. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=150.14s)]
*  I don't know where he was going or what's going on, but he decided to be, I guess, like [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=156.1s)]
*  a drifter and cause havoc at a baseball game. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=161.82s)]
*  Yeah, this just proves it's not a Texas problem. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=164.22s)]
*  It's not an Arizona problem. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=166.78s)]
*  This is happening all over our country in small towns. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=168.1s)]
*  How's the young girl doing and how are the players doing? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=170.7s)]
*  Because I understand they were traumatized. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, you can only imagine how they feel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=175.74s)]
*  I mean, me witnessing it as an adult, it kind of shocks me. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=179.7s)]
*  I mean, it puts you in a different perspective. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  You know, you change your views on a lot of things. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=185.1s)]
*  The girl, she's doing very well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=187.74s)]
*  I mean, she ended up getting out of the hospital. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  She's, you know, being a trooper about it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=193.06s)]
*  She actually went to school. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=195.46s)]
*  Her mom told her she didn't have to go to school if she didn't want to. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=198.22s)]
*  But she wanted to be strong and she wanted to have a day at school. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=200.38s)]
*  So, I mean, that tells you a lot about her character and all the boys, all the boys [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  were kind of shocked, you know, they're all strong kids. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=207.66s)]
*  I mean, they're only 12 years old. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=209.94s)]
*  But at the same time, I mean, something like that happens. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's something that adults shouldn't see. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=215.06s)]
*  But I mean, for these kids to see that just makes it a little bit harder and makes you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  a little bit more emotional for them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=223.22s)]
*  Yes, yes. I understand. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=225.46s)]
*  She has, you know, big medical bills now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=226.9s)]
*  She was stabbed in the hand and she's also going to need counseling. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=229.94s)]
*  Some of the other kids might need counseling. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=232.66s)]
*  So I know you can go to Fox. Absolutely. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=234.38s)]
*  You can go to Fox and Friends dot com if you want to give money to that GoFundMe page. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=235.9s)]
*  How are her parents doing? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=239.34s)]
*  They're they're actually doing pretty good. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=242.9s)]
*  You know, the mom is, you know, your typical mother. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=244.78s)]
*  She's very worried. She's very stressed about it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=247.46s)]
*  You know, she thinks all the time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=250.02s)]
*  Why her? Why me? Why this happen? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=251.66s)]
*  She's being strong, you know, I mean, I think with her daughter [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=255.1s)]
*  being strong is making her stronger. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=258.18s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Matt, tell the family, God bless them. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=260.82s)]
*  We're all praying for her. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  I know the young girl is terrified to go to any sporting events now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=265.82s)]
*  And that's completely understandable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=269.06s)]
*  So please tell them we're thinking about them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=271.22s)]
*  We're sorry this is happening. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=272.74s)]
*  Absolutely. Thank you very much. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnlpSLpQpE&t=275.14s)]
