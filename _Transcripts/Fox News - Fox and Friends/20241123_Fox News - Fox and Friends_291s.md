# Migrant caravan from Mexico flooding to US border before Trump takes office
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ)
*  A new caravan of at least 1,500 migrants are rushing to the southern border, trying to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  make it before President-elect Trump takes office as Texas steps up to help Trump's border [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=5.76s)]
*  agenda. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  While we're working on deporting the people, we also have to be equally successful at denying [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  illegal entry. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=17.88s)]
*  That includes putting up the barriers and doing everything possible to prevent anybody [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=19.04s)]
*  from crossing between a port of entry. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=23.6s)]
*  We are expanding those buoys in the river. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  They are completely effective at denying illegal entry and a byproduct that costs less [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=28.4s)]
*  than building a border wall, which Texas is doing also. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=34.16s)]
*  This comes as the Biden administration quietly loosens immigration policies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=38.56s)]
*  Former Acting ICE Director Ron Vitiello joins us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Ron, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=46.72s)]
*  So explain to us this quiet loosening. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  What exactly has the Biden administration done under the cover of night, actually, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=51.96s)]
*  to loosen the rules? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=57.58s)]
*  What are these rules? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=59.2s)]
*  Well thanks for inviting me, Rachel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=61.96s)]
*  This is another example where the Biden-Harris administration are going to bring down the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=63.6s)]
*  rules for in-person check-ins for the 8 million people who are on the non-detained docket [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=67.56s)]
*  at ICE. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=74.36s)]
*  And so under normal conditions, people would go monthly or every other month or quarterly, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=75.36s)]
*  depending on what their immigration officer has determined is a successful way for them [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=80.76s)]
*  to report in, to make sure they're on track for their supposed due process in immigration [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=87.64s)]
*  court, whether or not they're going to be able to stay in the United States or not. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  And so what we know from experience, what I know from experience both in the Border [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=96.7s)]
*  Patrol and at ICE, is that people who are not detained before they see an immigration [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=100.56s)]
*  judge are not likely to be removed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=105.44s)]
*  So when you pull down the in-person reporting to something that's virtual, you're telling [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=107.6s)]
*  the world, just like this administration has told the world about the border, they don't [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=113.52s)]
*  really care about enforcing immigration law. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  They're not too concerned about the people who are on the non-detained docket, even though [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=119.32s)]
*  there are one and a half million of that 8 million who have criminal records in the United [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  States or in a foreign country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's really unbelievable to me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=129.0s)]
*  I mean, there was a message sent in this election that people didn't want this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Before they leave office, they're like, we're going to make sure as many of these [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  illegals get in as possible with as little vetting as possible. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=140.38000000000002s)]
*  It's remarkable to me that they can't read the room. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=144.22s)]
*  I want to talk about this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  This is Massachusetts Governor Mara Healey. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=148.46s)]
*  She's saying she's not going to cooperate with Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=151.94s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=154.5s)]
*  Would the Massachusetts state police assist in mass deportations? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=156.5s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=162.5s)]
*  I think that the key here is that every tool in the toolbox has got to be used to protect [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=164.82s)]
*  our citizens, to protect our residents, and protect our states, and certainly to hold [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  the line on democracy and the rule of law. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=173.94s)]
*  Ron, this is fascinating because this, of course, this statement is on the heels of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=177.42s)]
*  ICE in Boston arresting three illegal immigrants, a child sex predator, an MS-13 gang member, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=182.61999999999998s)]
*  and a Brazilian drug trafficker as sanctuary cities and blue states continue to harbor [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=190.22s)]
*  these criminals. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=195.46s)]
*  What say you? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=196.46s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=199.82s)]
*  She talks about the rule of law, but that she doesn't want to assist in raising the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=200.82s)]
*  quality of life of her constituency in the state. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=205.18s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=208.9s)]
*  Who is she protecting? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=209.9s)]
*  She's trying to protect people who have entered the country illegally, not been invited here, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=210.9s)]
*  not been inspected, not been vetted. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=215.18s)]
*  People who are in the country illegally and then are in Massachusetts and break other [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=217.38000000000002s)]
*  laws in order to be arrested by local authorities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=220.58s)]
*  But she doesn't want to help ICE or help immigration enforcement in the United States. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  And the people who are affected the most by this are people in poor communities, and people [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=228.9s)]
*  who are in the working class, people who have to live amongst what we know now are criminals, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=233.06s)]
*  these Brazilians that you were just talking about. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=239.06s)]
*  They did heinous things to children. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=241.58s)]
*  And this is who she wants to protect? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=243.86s)]
*  I'm not sure what the state of Massachusetts cares about, but I think the quality of life [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=246.26s)]
*  in cities and towns all over the United States are being affected by the millions of illegal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=250.66s)]
*  aliens that are here and millions of them who go on to commit crimes in these communities. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=255.7s)]
*  And so that's not the rule of law. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=260.74s)]
*  It's bizarre for her to say those words out loud. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=262.5s)]
*  It's just crazy to me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=265.88s)]
*  Now, it's insane. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=267.22s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=268.58s)]
*  She sits in a governor's mansion with all kinds of security and protection. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=269.58s)]
*  And these criminals, as you mentioned, one of them a child predator, are able to roam [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=274.18s)]
*  around in the neighborhoods of the most vulnerable communities, the poorest communities, and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=278.68s)]
*  they're the ones who suffer the consequences. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=284.70000000000005s)]
*  Ron Vitiello, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=286.5s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5tHWXqDAQ&t=289.46000000000004s)]
