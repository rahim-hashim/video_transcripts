# Trump is 'full steam ahead for America': Lara Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0)
*  It was a tale of two Americas this Independence Day weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=0.0s)]
*  On the left, anti-Trump protesters displaying their hatred for the country, burning the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=4.08s)]
*  American flag as angry demonstrations spread across the country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=9.16s)]
*  But on the right, a historic moment for the president as he cements his America First [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=13.88s)]
*  agenda with the passing of the big, beautiful bill on the 4th of July. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=18.44s)]
*  Laura Trump, host of My View with Laura Trump, is up early with us this morning to react [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  to all of this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=27.38s)]
*  Laura, good morning to you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=28.459999999999997s)]
*  Happy 4th of July. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=29.46s)]
*  I hope you had a great celebration with your family. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=30.46s)]
*  We did, yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=33.98s)]
*  Happy, happy 4th. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=34.98s)]
*  And what a celebration we all got to have this year, Carly, right? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=36.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=39.22s)]
*  We had President Trump, who, as you just said, told everybody he wanted that bill on his [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=40.22s)]
*  desk to sign on the 4th of July. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=44.42s)]
*  He got it done. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  The Republicans got it done. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  And we have such optimism, I think, for the future of America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=48.9s)]
*  So we celebrated as a family. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=51.7s)]
*  And I know there were so many across the country who were relieved and feel so excited about [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  now the future of America under this president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=58.38s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm glad you said that because we were talking about two different, a tale [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=61.06s)]
*  of two Americas, two different views of where people are right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  And I want to take them one at a time with you because, as somebody who is so close with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=68.34s)]
*  the president, I was wondering how you would describe this current moment in Donald Trump's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=72.18s)]
*  presidency. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=78.38s)]
*  Well, it's funny because I heard you guys, before you went into the break, talking about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=81.78s)]
*  how Trump 2.0, kind of the second, you know, administration is different than the first. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=85.66s)]
*  And I think there was so much learned by my father-in-law during his first term in office. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=90.74s)]
*  And certainly over the past four years, watching how many of our freedoms were truly eroded [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=95.22s)]
*  in this country, watching really the destruction in so many ways of America. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=99.38s)]
*  And he really sat back and he looked and he planned what he would do in this moment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=103.5s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=107.98s)]
*  I haven't seen a second of him on defense, or quite frankly, the Republican Party on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=108.98s)]
*  defense. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=113.18s)]
*  It felt like full offense from President Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  He is not bogged down by the media like he was during the first term in office. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=117.22000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats are on their heels. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=121.62s)]
*  They cannot get a footing anywhere. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=123.26s)]
*  And he's full seam ahead for America because, look, Carly, he realizes he's got a limited [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  amount of time to accomplish so much for this country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=129.86s)]
*  I would say in the first six months, it's been incredible. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=133.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't know any other president in history who's been able to do this much, this quickly. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=135.9s)]
*  But he is a different president. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  He's a little more relaxed and he's having fun doing it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=142.98s)]
*  And you see him out there on the balcony dancing with Melania. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=145.14s)]
*  You go in the White House with him and he's excited to show you the paintings on the wall. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=148.5s)]
*  There really wasn't that much time for that during the first term. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=153.1s)]
*  But it's remarkable to see what he's accomplished and remarkable to see the way he's brought [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=155.98s)]
*  together the GOP. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  I have not seen a Republican Party this united in my entire lifetime. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  OK, so we also want to talk about my view with Lara Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=164.73999999999998s)]
*  It is tonight and you have a big episode ahead because you worked out with Defense Secretary [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  Pete Hegseth and nobody could take a challenge on like that with him quite like you because [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  everybody knows how incredibly physically fit you are. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  So that's something that we can all look forward to seeing you guys do together. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=183.96s)]
*  We know that Secretary Hegseth works out with the troops all the time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=186.72s)]
*  So it's a great idea for you to join them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=190.12s)]
*  What else can we expect during this interview and workout session that we're going to see [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=192.52s)]
*  tonight on your show? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=196.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, I had to work out with the Defense Secretary because he talked about increasing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=198.56s)]
*  the standards for our military. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=203.2s)]
*  Carly, I can confirm this was a tough workout. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=204.64s)]
*  If I'm saying it was a tough workout, believe me, it really was. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=207.64s)]
*  I also have HHS Secretary RFK Jr. on. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=211.2s)]

*  We're talking with him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=217.92s)]
*  We're talking with Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=218.92s)]
*  And we're going to the iconic Ford factory, a staple in America that really revolutionized [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  this country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=227.4s)]
*  They put out a truck every 53 seconds off their conveyor line. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=228.4s)]
*  It's amazing to see. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=233.04s)]
*  It's all Americana. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6nTwHUgY0&t=234.52s)]
