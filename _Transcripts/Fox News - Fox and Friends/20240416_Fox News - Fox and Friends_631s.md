# Speaker Mike Johnson: Mayorkas is the worst cabinet secretary who's ever served in US history
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw)
*  All right, 25 minutes after the top of the hour. Fox News alert this morning. As tensions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=0.0s)]
*  grow in the Middle East, Congress is under pressure to take up a 95 billion dollar Senate [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=6.88s)]
*  foreign aid bill. House Speaker Mike Johnson announcing his plan to split it into four [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=12.72s)]
*  different parts, separating Israel aid from the more controversial Ukraine vote. And it [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=18.36s)]
*  could come to the floor as soon as this Friday. So what are we going to be doing in the meantime [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  because it is Tuesday joining us right now with Speaker Johnson, Mr Speaker, what is the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=27.16s)]
*  thanks so much for joining us. What is the method to the madness of four separate bills [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=31.92s)]
*  gave both sides a chance to weigh in separately because it's such diversity of opinion on it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=37.64s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't think it was fair or right for the house to be, you know, rolled by the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Senate. They sent us a large bill where everything was merged together. The Senate [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  supplemental that was not the will of the house. The will of the house is to address it in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=52.0s)]
*  single subjects, you know, in regular order and a regular process with an amendment process. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=56.6s)]
*  That's the way this is supposed to work. So that's what we're going to do this week. So you'll [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=61.52s)]
*  have four different bills. As you said, you'll have Israel first in the order, then you'll have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=65.28s)]
*  the Indo-Pacific region, then you'll have the Ukraine matter. And then a fourth bill will [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=69.88s)]
*  introduce our other national security priorities. And that'll include sanctions for additional [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=74.64s)]
*  sanctions for Russia and Iran and the repo act, which is the seizure of corrupt Russian oligarchs [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=78.92s)]
*  assets to to assist with all this. We're going to introduce the loan concept into these products. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  And so this will be a very different, I think, product than the Senate. And we'll let the house [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=90.0s)]
*  do its will. That's what we have to do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=94.56s)]
*  So, Mr. Speaker, what's the vibe in your caucus? Because it seems like when it comes to the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=95.84s)]
*  Republicans, there's more support for the Israeli package, but not as much support for the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine package. How do you get the feel is going to go? Do you see more Republicans voting for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=107.96s)]
*  that package and then more Democrats voting for the Ukrainian package? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  That's probably the way it'll shake out. And the beauty of this process is, again, that every [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  member, Republican and Democrat, can vote their own district and their own conscience on this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=124.32s)]
*  thing. And that's the way it should work. Look, I think there's a lot of support for Israel, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=128.48s)]
*  obviously, on the Republican side. Clearly, on the Democrat side, they have a real division over [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=132.44s)]
*  that. It's been pretty shameful, actually, that leading Democrats are turning their backs on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=136.56s)]
*  Israel at this most desperate and important time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=141.28s)]
*  And then, of course, the inverse is true. On the other side, most of the Democrats, I think, are in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  favor of the Ukraine funding and some of my Republican colleagues are more, you know, a little [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=150.0s)]
*  less bullish on it. Let's say that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=156.0s)]
*  Look, I think there's a big difference between lethal aid, right, and some of the big [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  humanitarian things. If you convert assistance to a loan, I think that's more palatable for people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=161.88s)]
*  But we'll break this down. Look, 68 percent of the Ukraine funding is going to replenish our own [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=167.24s)]
*  stockpiles. That is American jobs making American weapons. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=172.56s)]
*  I think that's something that people understand and they'll support. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=176.44s)]
*  But we'll see how this plays out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I know you talked to the president yesterday. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=180.76s)]
*  Did you talk to him about his plans for Israel, his plans for Gaza? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=183.8s)]
*  What did what what did you all talk about? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=187.56s)]
*  Well, I called the president to give him a heads up and explain to him exactly what we're doing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  We're not going to be ruled by the Senate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  The House is its own body and the House has to work its own will. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=196.28s)]
*  And this is not what the president wanted. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=199.08s)]
*  It's not what Schumer wanted. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=200.96s)]
*  But I have to govern my chamber. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=203.0s)]
*  And I told him how this is going to go down. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=204.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, Mr. Speaker, ultimately, they've got to pass the rule first and they will. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  And then everybody gets to vote. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=213.08s)]
*  But there are a number of members of your own caucus, Republicans, who have said, you know, if [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  you bring up the Ukraine thing, this was a week or so ago, they would vote to vacate you, kick you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=219.08s)]
*  out of your job. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=224.52s)]
*  Two questions. One, is that still a worry? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=227.0s)]
*  And two, if you if they do vote to vacate and you're kicked out of your job, if you were to resign [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=231.24s)]
*  from Congress, you could theoretically give the Democrats the majority in the House of Representatives. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=237.56s)]
*  Look, none of that's going to happen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  I don't worry about the vacate motion at all. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm here to do my job. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  I think what a lot of people were concerned about was us being pressed to pass the Senate supplemental [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=250.04s)]
*  again, where everything's merged together. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=255.28s)]
*  This is what conservatives like me and all my friends, Freedom Caucus and otherwise, this is what we [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  desire. This is what we work towards, is to have the regular process of Congress work. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's exactly what you're going to see this week. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=266.6s)]
*  So, again, everybody gets to vote their conscience on each of these measures separately. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=268.16s)]
*  And I think that resolves the concern. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=272.0s)]
*  So, no, I'm not worried about that at all. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=274.36s)]
*  So you got 60 billion for Ukraine, 14 billion for Israel, 9 billion for humanitarian assistance [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=276.0s)]
*  to Gaza, 4.8 billion for Indo-Pacific. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  Two phases to this question. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  Number one, do you see this passing or not passing by Friday or is this going to be the beginning of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=286.6s)]
*  the process? And number two, have you met a Republican that doesn't look up to Ronald Reagan? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=292.48s)]
*  And what do you think Ronald Reagan would say about Ukraine aid? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=300.56s)]
*  Well, look, I'm a Reagan Republican. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=304.52s)]
*  You know, I'm a child of the 80s and we were all raised, as you know, Brian, all of us, we understood [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=306.4s)]
*  the concept of peace through strength, that America is an exceptional nation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=311.52s)]
*  We have an exceptional role in the world. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=314.92s)]
*  And the only reason that the world order has been maintained since World War Two is because we're [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=317.4s)]
*  perceived as the superpower that can that can defend freedom. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=321.32s)]
*  It doesn't mean we need to be the world's policeman at all, but it means we have an important role. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=324.8s)]
*  And the perception of a strong America is good for stability around the globe. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  So that's what we're going to project here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=333.88s)]
*  I think we'll do our duty, our responsibility with regard to the numbers that some of that still being [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  decided. The bill text will come out later today. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=340.12s)]
*  But one of the important things to note here is that in the amendment process to all this, our members [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=342.56s)]
*  can bring amendments to, for example, add pay for for a lot of this funding. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  So this is going to make sense to people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=351.88s)]
*  I think this is the process what the American people should expect. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  So, Mr. Speaker, go ahead, Ainsley. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=356.24s)]
*  Well, Mr. Speaker, thank you, Lawrence. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=358.04s)]
*  There were all these chaotic protests yesterday in New York, in California and Chicago. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=359.64s)]
*  I know you were following that five hours on the Golden Gate Bridge. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=364.76s)]
*  People couldn't move. The Senate is introducing this new law to make it a federal crime to purposely [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=368.44s)]
*  obstruct public roads and highways. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=373.56s)]
*  What is the House doing? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=375.68s)]
*  Yeah, look, we will do the same. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=377.4s)]
*  What's so shameful about all this for all the obvious reasons is that we're turning our back on Israel, our [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=379.4s)]
*  critical ally and important friend. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=384.8s)]
*  But the most shameful part about it, I'm afraid, is the silence that you hear from Washington. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=387.76s)]
*  There's so many leading Democrats who refuse to speak out about this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=392.72s)]
*  And, you know, I think they're appeasing the pro-Hamas wing of their party now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=396.36s)]
*  And that's a serious problem. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=399.96s)]
*  We need to stand with Israel unequivocally. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=401.24s)]
*  I spoke to my counterpart, the speaker, the Knesset, Speaker Ohana, about 36 hours ago or so. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=403.8s)]
*  And he thanked me and us, the Republicans and others who have stood strong with Israel, with our voices. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=409.52s)]
*  And that's a very important thing for them. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=415.12s)]
*  I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu about a week ago, and he expressed the same sentiment. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=417.68s)]
*  We've got to stand strong. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=422.64s)]
*  We've got to tell the world and show the world that Israel is not alone here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=423.84s)]
*  But, Mr. Speaker, something has changed because we covered the event, the march in Washington, where you had [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=427.28s)]
*  you, Hakeem Jeffords gave a powerful speech. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=433.52s)]
*  You had Chuck Chum. You guys were all linked in arms. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=436.24s)]
*  And you all said that you're going to stand with Israel. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=438.88s)]
*  But it seems like some of the people on the left now are a little fickle. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=442.36s)]
*  And right now, Israel needs us. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  They have the same enemy as we have, which is Iran. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=449.12s)]
*  Hamas is not a friend of ours. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=451.8s)]
*  Have you had any conversations with the leader about his party? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=454.16s)]
*  Because you got Rashida Tlaib that's in there, and in her district, people are saying, death to America. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=458.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's unconscionable that anybody would stand by that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=466.2s)]
*  And it's shameful that we have House members who do. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, Chuck Schumer is really responsible for Israel not being funded yet. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  Remember, we sent over an Israel funding package back in October. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=476.72s)]
*  It was within the first week of my being the speaker. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=480.92s)]
*  We did a pay for it. We took it out of the IRS expansion slush fund to take care of that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=484.04s)]
*  But he refused to even address it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=488.24s)]
*  And it's been sitting on his desk. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=490.12s)]
*  We tried to pass Israel again about a month ago. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=491.24s)]
*  And one hundred sixty six House Democrats voted against that funding. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  Why? Because Joe Biden said he would veto it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  It's really shameful. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=499.24s)]
*  Well, speaking of Chuck Schumer's desk later today from the House, you're going to march over and drop on his desk [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  the articles of impeachment for Alexandra Alejandra Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security secretary. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  You guys passed that months ago. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=516.24s)]
*  Why is this taking so long? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=517.92s)]
*  Well, the timing is important. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=520.0s)]
*  Look, the Biden border catastrophe is the number one priority of House Republicans, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=521.52s)]
*  and it remains the number one priority. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=526.56s)]
*  The American people were fighting for border security every single day. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  We have passed our legislation. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=531.56s)]
*  We passed resolutions and now we passed the articles of impeachment. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  That's our constitutional responsibility in the House. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=536.76s)]
*  We did a long, methodical, deliberate process as the Constitution requires of us. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=539.2399999999999s)]
*  And we got that done. And now we're transmitting it to the Senate. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  And we're demanding that Chuck Schumer have the full trial, that they hear the evidence, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=547.64s)]
*  let us put it on for the American people and then remove this individual from office. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=552.72s)]
*  Desperate times call for desperate measures. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=556.76s)]
*  And Secretary Mayorkas is, in my view, the worst cabinet secretary that has ever served in the history of the United States. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=559.12s)]
*  It is a catastrophe that was committed by design. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=564.96s)]
*  They allowed this. We all know the facts and the terrible tragedies that have come from it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=568.68s)]
*  And there has to be accountability. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=572.52s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, in all that aid, nothing that you're requesting for Friday, none of it has border in it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=574.04s)]
*  Why not? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=579.48s)]
*  Well, we are trying to merge some of that into it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=580.64s)]
*  But the difficulty with the border provisions is that, you know, the Schumer Senate won't move it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  We've sent over our legislation, as I noted, we've sent over resolutions. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=589.08s)]
*  We've sent a lot to the Senate. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=592.16s)]
*  It dies on his desk. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=593.76s)]
*  H.R.2. is our big signature piece. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  And it had all the provisions that would solve that border catastrophe. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  But what's really important here to emphasize as well is the president has executive authority and he needs to use it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=599.72s)]
*  I think most of the American people understand that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=606.28s)]
*  He could close the border today. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=608.44s)]
*  He could have closed it two and a half years ago. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  He refuses to do it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=612.72s)]
*  Indeed. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=614.5200000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=617.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  Thank you for your faith. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9uTD1jpOw&t=618.6800000000001s)]
