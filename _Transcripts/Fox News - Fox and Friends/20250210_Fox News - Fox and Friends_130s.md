# Trump reveals 'beautiful' real estate plan for Gaza Strip
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk)
*  Brett Baer had an exclusive interview as we told you earlier, but you didn't see this part. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=0.0s)]
*  This is him talking about his plan for a guys watch. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=5.0s)]
*  We'll build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people. We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=9.0s)]
*  Could be five, six, could be two, but we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=14.0s)]
*  In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=22.0s)]
*  It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=29.0s)]
*  No, they wouldn't because they're going to have much better housing, much better. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=34.0s)]
*  In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=39.0s)]
*  It's not habitable. It will be years before it could happen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=46.0s)]
*  I'm talking about starting to build. And I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=49.0s)]
*  You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=54.0s)]
*  So you're going to watch Brett's interview with him tonight on Special Report. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=57.0s)]
*  What is interesting is the part where he says, you know, they would not have the right to return to their land. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=61.0s)]
*  The question is, where would they go? Would those other countries come in and say, OK, they can live here? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=68.0s)]
*  Would it be permanent? It sounds like that is part of the deal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=74.0s)]
*  The president does say and I'll give you one more little snippet. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=78.0s)]
*  He says we give those countries hundreds of billions of dollars, in which case it's kind of like, OK, we're helping you out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=81.0s)]
*  You help us out. Yeah, that's how about the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=88.0s)]
*  So the interview is split into two parts, one for the Super Bowl and then Brett Baer is going to have much more with the president that's going to air on his show today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=90.0s)]
*  But that part about the Gaza Strip and what the president intends to do with it is a major newsmaker. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=96.0s)]
*  And it is offering to the world. He's saying there are no better options. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=102.0s)]
*  It's going to take 10 to 15 years to rebuild this rubble. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=106.0s)]
*  This is what I think should happen. Now the ball's in your court. Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, our allies in the Middle East. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=109.0s)]
*  What do you think about it? If you don't like the plan, come up with something different. Bring something to the table. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5eZ73UjGPk&t=115.0s)]
