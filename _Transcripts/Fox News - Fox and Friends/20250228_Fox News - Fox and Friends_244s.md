# ICE arrests suspected gang member outside school
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE)
*  ICE officials confirming the arrest of a violent gang member outside a charter school in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=0.0s)]
*  city of Chicago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And school officials are outraged over ICE doing that and arresting that guy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=7.72s)]
*  Ty Pyro has the details. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=12.8s)]
*  Good morning, Todd. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=13.8s)]
*  Good morning to all four of you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=14.8s)]
*  This arrest taking place on Wednesday outside a charter school in Chicago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=15.96s)]
*  Fox News obtaining the video of the suspect being taken away by ICE. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=19.84s)]
*  You see it right there on your screen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=23.64s)]
*  Federal officials have revealed that the man is a violent street gang member with a criminal [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  record that includes drug trafficking, gang loitering and property damage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=29.3s)]
*  Officials also saying he had been previously deported from the U.S. in 2005 and in 2013. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=34.54s)]
*  But just hours before officials confirmed the suspect's criminal past, the Chicago Teachers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=40.42s)]
*  Union and city officials condemned the arrest and President Trump's immigration enforcement [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=45.46s)]
*  efforts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=51.06s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=52.06s)]
*  Children watched as their daddy was put in handcuffs by agents carrying out the orders [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=53.06s)]
*  of a tyrant president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=58.66s)]
*  When we have parents being grabbed from our schools, we've got to wonder what is the Chicago [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=59.66s)]
*  public schools doing to protect our children? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=65.7s)]
*  I would like to see our school district figure out how to keep people safe, how to keep schools [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=67.78s)]
*  open and welcoming and safe for our young people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  That rally you see there was planned before the ICE arrest as the charter school officials [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=78.02s)]
*  have been in talks to close seven charter schools. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=81.94s)]
*  Both ICE and school officials confirm that agents did not attempt to enter the school. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=85.34s)]
*  Back over to you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=90.58s)]
*  Todd, just to be clear, so this guy who's accused of being a gang member and drug trafficking [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=91.58s)]
*  and things like that, he was in a car near a school. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  There were school kids in the car, it sounds like, but they weren't his kids. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=100.98s)]
*  So it was just a bunch of coincidences. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=106.38s)]
*  It's near a school. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  There are school kids in there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=111.14s)]
*  The fact that it was so close to the school, that's what outrages them, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=112.74s)]
*  But of course, Steve, as we well know and as we've covered multiple times, the left [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=116.82s)]
*  takes an opportunity like this to make an example, regardless of whether or not the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=121.02s)]
*  facts are on their side. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=124.64s)]
*  And here, as we reported, the facts are not on their side. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=125.9s)]
*  These ICE agents did not go into the school. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=128.82s)]
*  This individual is a criminal according to our laws. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=131.46s)]
*  And under President Trump and Tom Homan's efforts, criminals that are illegal migrants [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=135.04s)]
*  are going to be deported out of our country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=138.84s)]
*  I don't care if they even went into the school. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=141.94s)]
*  If you got a gangbanger who is selling drugs that are killing children, by the way, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=144.34s)]
*  recruiting kids because when it comes to prosecuting the kids versus the adults, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=149.22s)]
*  it's different. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=154.02s)]
*  I want the guy out. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=155.22s)]
*  I don't care if you have to go into school or not. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=156.18s)]
*  And it seems like there's more outrage on the area. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  We'll go back to process again with the Democrats. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=161.34s)]
*  They weren't more concerned about the process than the crime that's being committed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  I think they're focused on the wrong thing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=167.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  This is a guy who is from Mexico, been deported twice, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=169.26s)]
*  no member of a street gang, been convicted of drug trafficking, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  gang loitering, and damage to property. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=177.14s)]
*  If I'm a mom at that school, I want him arrested. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=179.22s)]
*  I'm going to say, why is this guy hanging out in front of our kids' school? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and who were those kids? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  They were hanging out with the kids. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  You said that those weren't his kids. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=189.18s)]
*  So who were those kids? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=191.06s)]
*  Well, and here's the thing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=192.62s)]
*  A lot of schools are no gun zones. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  So if the guy's got a gun, go after him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=196.42s)]
*  We don't know exactly the particulars about it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=198.7s)]
*  But nonetheless, I think a lot of people on the left are trying to make it seem [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=201.54s)]
*  like if there are arrests near schools, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=205.14s)]
*  migrant families will not drop their kids off at school. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=208.98s)]
*  If you're not a gang banger, I don't think you got to worry about it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=212.33999999999997s)]
*  All right, the other problem, that's why the guy's got 18% [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  approval rating as mayor. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=218.26s)]
*  Kim Foxcott voted out. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=219.54s)]
*  And hopefully, Alvin Bragg will be next. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=221.54s)]
*  It's a big push in this country to be aware of who your DAs are, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=223.1s)]
*  to get those criminals once arrested to stay in jail. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=227.14s)]
*  Hopefully, these cities one by one will start straightening themselves out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkBPDz0-xE&t=230.7s)]
