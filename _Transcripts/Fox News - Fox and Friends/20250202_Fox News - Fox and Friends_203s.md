# Trump's warning to ISIS terrorists
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o)
*  Not even two weeks in office, President Trump already scoring another victory for the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=0.0s)]
*  This one against ISIS. He ordered a military airstrike against the terrorist group's leaders [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=4.88s)]
*  in Somalia. The president saying in part, quote, these killers who we found hiding in caves [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=9.92s)]
*  threatened the United States and our allies. The strikes destroyed the caves they live in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=15.76s)]
*  and killed many terrorists without in any way harming civilians. Foreign policy expert Rebecca [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=21.52s)]
*  Heinrichs joins us now. Good morning, Rebecca. Good morning. So I look at this and I'm reading [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=27.52s)]
*  there are people arguing that this was more of a show of force than a strategic move. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=34.32s)]
*  Do you have any insight as to how important this airstrike was? Well, I think it's important [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  because President Trump decided to announce it. He announced that the United States did this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=44.16s)]
*  He and then he also had a threat for anybody else who would threaten the United States. We will find [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=48.72s)]
*  you, he said, and we will kill you. If you remember, Joey, during 2017, when President [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=53.2s)]
*  Trump came into office the first time, he designated down the authorities to military [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  commanders to take out ISIS. He increased aerial bombings and uses of special forces. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=62.64s)]
*  And the effect of that was the successful destruction of the ISIS caliphate within about [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=67.2s)]
*  a year, 95 percent of it. And so during the Biden administration, you've seen ISIS grow back. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  And so now the Trump administration has to come in, reestablish itself, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=77.68s)]
*  get back in the game and to say the United States is not going to tolerate this and we're [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=81.52s)]
*  going to go back to destroying terrorists that threaten Americans. You know, I understand that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=84.88s)]
*  ISIS as an entity has fingers all over the world, all over the region in Africa and the Middle East. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  They don't always get along, but it was ISIS-K that we're told orchestrated the attacks in 2021 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  at the air base. And then we have an ISIS group here in Somalia. We also have other groups in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=102.24s)]
*  Somalia. We also have an ISIS-inspired attack in New Orleans. Is this kind of messaging [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=108.48s)]
*  that President Trump, hey, I destroyed the caliphate my first time around. I'm going to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=115.76s)]
*  destroy all of you this time around. Are those things connected? Is this being his first military [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=119.2s)]
*  action? Is that because of what happened in New Orleans and what happened at the air base? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  I think it's related, Joey, because the way it works is ISIS grows. As you said, you're going to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=127.68s)]
*  you're always going to have terrorists, Islamic terrorists around the world. But what the United [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=132.0s)]
*  States can do is to destroy the caliphate where they actually have essentially basing, where they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=136.4s)]
*  grow, where they train and then where they can recruit, because then they're really they get [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  stronger and then they have more successful recruiting through the Internet because they show, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=148.0s)]
*  you know, would be radicals that they're strong. And so the United States needs to destroy those [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  physical caliphates where they exist. You mentioned in Africa, you know, under the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=158.72s)]
*  Biden administration, Niger and Chad were two countries where the United States was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=162.16s)]
*  conducting counterterrorism operations and we were kicked out under the Biden administration. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  And so it's harder to do. So now I think it is important for the Trump administration to say, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=170.4s)]
*  we're going to destroy you where you are and you're not going to have successful recruiting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=174.72s)]
*  because we want to secure America's borders here at home and make sure Americans are safe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=178.96s)]
*  Yeah, I won't lose I won't lose a minute of sleep over some terrorists getting killed. I kind of like [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=182.56s)]
*  it. So, Rebecca, hundreds, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLzxdF2C9o&t=187.35999999999999s)]
