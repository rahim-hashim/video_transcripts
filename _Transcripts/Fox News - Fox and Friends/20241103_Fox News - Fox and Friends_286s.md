# Biden says Republicans are the ‘kind of guys you’d like to smack in the a—'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4)
*  So if you have the if Trump passes out if let's say Trump calls on to Arizona and Georgia and North Carolina [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, he just needs one of the blue walls. Just one just one and Nevada [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=6.04s)]
*  He has a good shot in Nevada, but they said they have not broken the wall has not broken since 88 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=10.24s)]
*  This is what you get when you get them all you get none you get none [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=15.64s)]
*  This is what I talked to someone who's very involved in this yesterday [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=18.48s)]
*  And they said the biggest problem for Kamala is she has a math problem and all early voting. She is falling short [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=21.84s)]
*  Trump has to win one either Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan looks like he has North Carolina, Georgia [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=28.0s)]
*  Arizona and a good shot in Nevada, but that only gets them to 268 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=33.88s)]
*  So that's why he has to win one of those three. He's up in all three in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, but it is extremely tight [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=37.8s)]
*  That's why everyone needs to vote and looks like the only chance for Kamala. She has to sweep the blue wall [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=44.88s)]
*  She has to sweep Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan and would have to wait. She seems very concerned about it, too [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=49.58s)]
*  And I just you know Jackie just done a report. She's gonna do these two events today [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=54.56s)]
*  She's doing one in Detroit, Michigan at the headquarters of Kojic essentially Bishop Sheard [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=58.24s)]
*  That is not a demographic that she should still be working for in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=64.36s)]
*  The final days of the election and so I just find it they are concerned about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=69.04s)]
*  Two things either some black voters breaking for Trump in a way that could be 29 to 30% [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=74.0s)]
*  when it comes to black males or people just staying at home and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  That is problematic if these voters stay at home or cast their vote in a small portion for Donald Trump. That's ballgame [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=83.84s)]
*  Yeah, right. It feels as though black males have stayed home in the early voting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=90.8s)]
*  That's where it that's where it stands [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=95.16s)]
*  So so far the turnout for for blacks in the voting early voting has not been strong [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  No, isn't early voting turnout really low compared to the last election granted last election [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=102.0s)]
*  We were in kovats [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=106.68s)]
*  So a lot of people did early voting [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  You know and we've been breaking down the number of Republicans who have early voted and Democrats what? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=108.84s)]
*  Oftentimes is not mentioned are the independents and in particular states like North Carolina [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=114.68s)]
*  There are more independents or third party or unaffiliated people than there are Republicans or Democrats [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=119.2s)]
*  And so they really hold the key in the meantime Jackie a moment ago said [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=124.72s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden was since Granton his hometown and used some language that was not helpful to the Kamala Harris campaign [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=129.36s)]
*  And you gotta wonder what is he doing when he says stuff like this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=137.16s)]
*  There's one more thing Trump and his Republican friends want to do they want another giant tax cut for the wealthy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=143.08s)]
*  Now I know some of you guys are tempted to think it's macho guy. I'll tell you what man [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=149.88s)]
*  Well, I just granted I used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  But I'm serious these are the kind of guys you like to smack in your ass [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=161.84s)]
*  Oh [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  He grits his teeth [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  So he's here get off my lawn with a few dozen in front of a few dozen people and he's there just to make sure that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it looks like it's busy work. So he's there to say that and then he gets off [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Kilted think about what he was saying. He's saying they want to give a tax cut to the wealthy and then he segues into violence [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=182.12s)]
*  I want to beat this guy up. I want to smack him [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=188.08s)]
*  Didn't he want to take him behind the barn at one point? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  Like a few years ago when he was saying it was healthier [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=193.84s)]
*  But didn't y'all see the report from the staffer saying essentially no one listens to him anymore [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=196.56s)]
*  I mean, this is the president United States. This is a person that's responsible for our national security [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  I know we joke about it, but he's still the person that's in charge. We got people saying oh, yeah [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=207.0s)]
*  We just don't listen to him that they're afraid to put him on the campaign trail because he does things like this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=213.4s)]
*  I mean there's a real national security component of this to a point that is quite scary [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=217.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean plus he's he's so [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=223.84s)]
*  Angry, he's angry, but he's talking about fighting bless his heart. I don't want to picture him in a fight [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=226.92000000000002s)]

*  Kamala Harris [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=241.84s)]
*  No, so she's telling her supporters to go ahead and vote on the non-political things on the ballot different ballot initiatives [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-W78yR8uQ4&t=242.64000000000001s)]
