# Biden admin ‘created’ this ‘mess,’ won’t clean it up: Abraham Accords negotiator
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc)
*  If we win, it'll be very simple. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's all going to work out and very quickly. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=6.4s)]
*  If we don't, you're going to end up with major wars in the Middle East and maybe a third [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=8.84s)]
*  world war. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=12.96s)]
*  You are closer to a third world war right now than at any time since the second world [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=14.42s)]
*  war. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=20.48s)]
*  President Trump issuing that dire warning about a potential Kamala Harris presidency [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  This comes after Netanyahu's visit with Harris in D.C. where the Israeli leader was reportedly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=27.36s)]
*  upset with her remarks on Gaza fearing they could jeopardize a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=34.6s)]
*  Adam Boller is former senior Trump administration official who helped negotiate the Abraham [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Accords and he joins us now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=46.16s)]
*  Adam, thanks for being here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=47.96s)]
*  So what did you hear? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=49.84s)]
*  What do you think Bibi Netanyahu heard from the remarks of Kamala Harris? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=50.84s)]
*  Did he hear daylight and how would that impact our relationship with Israel and its ability [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  to defeat Hamas? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=58.44s)]
*  I think he did hear daylight and I think the job of the United States right now is to stand [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  strongly with our ally and it's not just about what Vice President Harris said. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  It's about what she did. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=72.6s)]
*  When you don't attend a joint session of Congress because you have a meeting at your sorority, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=74.36s)]
*  which I really when I saw the sorority thing I had to look on Twitter a whole bunch. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=80.92s)]
*  I thought it was some far right conspiracy stuff but actually a sorority meeting to miss [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=84.56s)]
*  a meeting with our top ally that says a lot and so both actions and words are showing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  some daylight and that's what's going to hurt a relationship. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=96.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=100.88s)]
*  By the way, what would in contrast, you know, what does support for Israel look like right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=101.88s)]
*  now? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=107.88s)]
*  Is it pressing for a ceasefire? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=108.88s)]
*  Is it allowing them to finish the job? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=109.88s)]
*  If they are our closest ally, how should we be supporting them in your minds? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  When we negotiated the Abraham Accords, when we were there, it was enabled because we took [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=115.76s)]
*  out the number two guy in Iran. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  So what the administration needs to do right now is tighten everything they can on Iran. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=122.44s)]
*  This is all Iran proxy war. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't let oil get out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=130.0s)]
*  We shouldn't let Iran get rich. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=131.68s)]
*  So what they should do is tighten everything they can on Iran and then they've got to go [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  after and get our hostages home. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=137.52s)]
*  So I would say it's a combination of support tightening against Iran and we have five Americans [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=141.1s)]
*  that are there and we're doing nothing to get them home. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=147.5s)]
*  So what you just described is definitely what they won't do since they've catered to Iran [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  at every step and hence the problem. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=155.28s)]
*  By the way, sticking on Kamala Harris for a second, she's bragged in interviews that she [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=157.94s)]
*  was the last person in the room when the Afghanistan withdrawal decision was made. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=162.74s)]
*  I've been asking this question. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=167.62s)]
*  What is her foreign policy experience or perspective? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  She has zero foreign policy experience and she is of all, it's an interesting brag and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  it just shows how inexperienced one is. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  That was the biggest debacle of the administration to have people hanging on planes as we went [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  out and so this is the funny thing and it's the crazy thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Everybody says you've got Kamala saying she's going into Detroit, she's trying to win Michigan, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  she wants to tell everybody that we want to ceasefire. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=194.62s)]
*  The reality is this administration created the conflict by being weak in Afghanistan, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=197.66s)]
*  being weak in Russia and that emboldens Iran and Hamas to do what they did. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=204.34s)]
*  So they're actually created the mess that they are not now cleaning up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=208.5s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=212.78s)]
*  True strength deters conflict, doesn't have to fight them in the first place and that's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=213.78s)]
*  what Donald Trump proved. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=218.46s)]
*  Adam Bowler, thank you for your time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=219.9s)]
*  Thank you, Pete. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=222.34s)]
*  You got it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=223.34s)]
*  I'm juicy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1bp97qmmTc&t=224.34s)]
