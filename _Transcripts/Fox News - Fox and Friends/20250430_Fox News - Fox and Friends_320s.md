# 'STUPID QUESTION': Trump fires back at ABC host during fiery interview exchange
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE)
*  President Trump celebrating his first hundred days at a rally with supporters of Michigan Watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=0.0s)]
*  We're for common sense. We like strong borders. We like good education. We like low interest rates. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  We like being able to buy a beautiful car and now deduct the interest on the loan that's never [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  happened before. In 100 days we have delivered the most profound change in Washington in nearly 100 years. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=17.44s)]
*  So if you're taking a list right now, so far the president has signed at least 142 executive orders, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=24.56s)]
*  confirmed 21 cabinet members, saved 160 billion dollars with Doge and decreased border encounters [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=31.68s)]
*  by 94 percent. Mark Thiessen is a Fox News contributor, Fox former speechwriter for George W. Bush. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=39.36s)]
*  Mark, thanks so much for joining the program this morning. Good to be with you. I guess you could say [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=46.8s)]
*  the border numbers are his best numbers so far. Yeah, oh 100 percent. He's got an A plus on the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=52.4s)]
*  border. I mean you know remember that Joe Biden said I can't secure the border unless Congress [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=61.44s)]
*  passes a bipartisan border bill. Well, Congress didn't pass the border bill and Trump shut it down [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=66.32s)]
*  not in 100 days, in a few weeks, completely shut down the border. It's an unmitigated success [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=71.84s)]
*  and now he's doing what the American people asked him to do. New York Times poll 86 percent [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=79.12s)]
*  want to round up and deport all the illegal migrants with criminal records and he's doing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  exactly what 86 percent of the American people want and the Democrats are opposing him. So you know [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=87.76s)]
*  that's probably not the smartest strategy. So one of the things that the Trump administration now is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=94.16s)]
*  talking about is the economy. I know people are standing by for the tariffs and the big beautiful [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  bill but when you look in the first hundred days they've created 345,000 jobs. Veteran unemployment [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=103.52s)]
*  rate is down from 4.2 percent in January to 3.8 in March. Prescription drug prices have gone down [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=110.64s)]
*  two percent. Gas prices are down seven percent. Energy prices are down two percent and foreign and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=118.32s)]
*  private investment of five trillion dollars. Is that something they need to talk about more? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. Look the gas prices he said in some places is less than two dollars. Everyone's paying [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=128.48s)]
*  less at the gas pump. Everyone's playing less at the grocery store. Now people are bracing for the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=135.44s)]
*  effects of the tariffs and his poll numbers on the economy are not good but that's because he's got a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=139.28s)]
*  lot of things in play right now. I mean you look at the tariff situation. When he was president [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=144.16s)]
*  in 2018 he went to the European Union and the G7 and said how about this zero for zero tariff deal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  and they were like there was crickets. Nobody was interested. All of a sudden now they're coming to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=156.72s)]
*  him and saying hey how about a zero for zero tariff deal. The only reason is because he imposed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=160.96s)]
*  he started the trade war. He started the tariff war and so this is going to play out over the next [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=165.76s)]
*  six months next few months. If in the next few months he gets 75 trade deals and passes a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=170.32s)]
*  comprehensive tax reform bill that could that spurs economic growth his numbers on the economy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=176.88s)]
*  are going to skyrocket. So this is a work in progress but and he's in the early stages of it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=182.0s)]
*  So the president I think part of the reason the numbers are down in some respect is the negative [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=187.2s)]
*  coverage that's been coming from the media. I mean he gives them all a shot even the ones that don't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=192.88s)]
*  like him and they still only give him negative coverage. Yesterday I found this exchange [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=197.68s)]
*  interesting. It was a conversation on ABC about Pete Hexeth. This is the question they posed to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=203.68s)]
*  the president. Let's watch. You have 100% confidence in. I don't have 100% confidence in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=209.04s)]
*  anything. Okay anything. Do I have 100%? It's a stupid question. Look it's pretty important. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=215.68s)]
*  I have none. No you don't have 100%. Only a liar would say I have 100% confidence. I don't have 100% [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=222.88s)]
*  confidence that we're going to finish this interview. I mean it is so true. What was he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=231.04s)]
*  going to say? 90 or 30%? But if you look at the coverage though Mark when it comes to RFK Jr. 89% [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=235.28s)]
*  negative coverage. Elon Musk 96%. Pete Hexeth 100% negative coverage. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=244.16s)]
*  Yeah look the media is in part of the opposition. They're part of the resistance. But I think the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=252.4s)]
*  thing is Americans factor this into their viewing of the coverage right now. There's an Edelman [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=257.28s)]
*  Trust Barometer poll for 2025 that just came out. Seven in ten Americans say that the media [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=261.36s)]
*  is pushing an ideology rather than trying to inform the public. They get it. So you know it's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=267.12s)]
*  not that the media is not going to impact people's views of Donald Trump. What's going to impact [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  people's views on Donald Trump is if the terrorists produce trade deals, if he passes the big beautiful [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  bill, if he gets a grow, if he gives people, if he cuts their taxes and eliminates taxes on tips, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=285.68s)]
*  taxes on overtime, taxes on on caring for elderly. If he does all, delivers on all those promises [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=291.04s)]
*  nobody's going to care what ABC News asks him when he's in an interview. It's so true. They bypassed [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=297.2s)]
*  him the last election as well because he went straight to the American people. Mark thanks so [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=301.2s)]
*  much for getting up. Exactly. Take care. You too. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iwBUIgNwE&t=305.84000000000003s)]
