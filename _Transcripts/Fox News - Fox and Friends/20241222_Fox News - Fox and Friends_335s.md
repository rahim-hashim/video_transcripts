# Chicago residents furious with mayor after shocking political decision-making
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo)
*  Far left mayor Brandon Johnson facing calls to resign. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes after the city's public schools CEO was fired Friday after he refused to take out [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=3.44s)]
*  a $300 million loan for a new teachers union contract. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  That is the same union that once employed Mayor Johnson. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=12.96s)]
*  One op-ed arguing it is time for Johnson to resign saying this, quote, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=15.92s)]
*  you have demonstrated you are not a mayor for all of Chicago, but only for your friends [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  at the Chicago teachers union. You are willing to use your power to benefit those closest to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=24.96s)]
*  you while using the children you say you care about as political cover for your disastrous [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=29.92s)]
*  decision making. Our next guest says this loan was all about Johnson's push to help illegal [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=35.440000000000005s)]
*  migrants already costing his own taxpayers more than half a billion. That's with a B, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=40.56s)]
*  billion dollars. Chicago resident, Kata Trust joins us now with more. Kata, good morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  What a non-Christmas gift for this CEO, Pedro Martinez. What happened here? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=51.84s)]
*  Good morning. Basically what happened is our mayor has decided, decided that he wanted CEO [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=58.08s)]
*  Pedro Martinez to leave. They asked him to resign when he refused to secure the $300 million loan [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=66.8s)]
*  that the city wanted him to incur that would have put the city basically in a junk bond status and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=76.8s)]
*  lowered the city's credit rating. And Pedro refused to adhere to that. Also, you know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=84.8s)]
*  we would be remiss if we didn't talk about prior to our new elected school board being appointed, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=92.32s)]
*  all of the board members resigned because when the mayor asked them to fire Pedro Martinez [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=98.88s)]
*  initially, they refused, citing that there was no real reason to fire him and the fact that they [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=105.36s)]
*  agreed with him not taking out the loan. And so, you know, we have our mayor who went to our state [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=111.6s)]
*  senator to maneuver the laws that took place that got our elected school board so that the CTE, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=118.88s)]
*  Chicago teachers union could have control of how those people were elected. And also given the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=128.16s)]
*  mayor more control or CTU because they're wanting the same when the appointments for the Chicago [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=136.0s)]
*  new elected board were appointed. And so as you see, initially, all of the members were supposed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=142.64s)]
*  to be elected and Mayor Johnson went to our state senator, I guess, head in hand and asked him to do [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  things a little differently and to change how the members were going to be appointed, as well as how [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=156.88s)]
*  they were elected. I think that we would be remiss if we didn't talk about the fact that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=163.28s)]
*  they're asking, they asked these parents and regular community members to come up with a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=168.24s)]
*  thousand signatures in order to get on a ballot. Now, keep in mind that we have congressmen and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=176.08s)]
*  state senators who don't have to have more than 300 signatures to get on the ballot. So to ask a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=181.84s)]
*  parent to come up with that kind of signatures was already setting parents up to fail, putting him in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=187.76s)]
*  a position to appoint the people that he wanted to appoint, which is why we have now our CEO of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=193.44s)]
*  Chicago public schools now being fired. And kind of let's take a look and remind our viewers about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=199.84s)]
*  Mayor Johnson's record, a $982 million budget deficit and proposing this $300 million property [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=205.2s)]
*  tax hike spent $527 million on new migrant arrivals into Chicago's shot spotter gun shot [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=213.36s)]
*  detection tech, despite a 33 to 14 alderman vote in favor of saving it. Kata, what is the future now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=222.0s)]
*  What comes next with Pedro Martinez, the CEO, because it appears he was fired, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=230.96s)]
*  quote, without cause and now has some legal standing perhaps to challenge it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=236.56s)]
*  Well, of course, I'm sure that he is going to challenge it. I'm sure that he is going to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=241.84s)]
*  probably sue the city of Chicago, which means that the city is going to be find itself in deeper [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=245.68s)]
*  financial debt. And it's just a travesty. Let me just say that as mayor, any mayor who comes in has [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=252.16s)]
*  the right to appoint the person that they want. That's not what happened here with Pedro Martinez. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=259.44s)]
*  Pedro Martinez basically lost his job because he refused to do something that would have been bad [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=265.44s)]
*  for the city. Keep in mind that also within this teacher's contract is a $2,000 set aside per month [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=272.64s)]
*  for migrant students only. Now, keep in mind that this is only for migrant students. It's not for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=280.48s)]
*  underprivileged students. It's not for students whose families are in financial straits, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=285.52s)]
*  migrant students only. There's also a set aside of $60 million. Now, this is within the teacher's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=290.56s)]
*  contract, which has nothing to do really with teachers for housing for students who are [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=296.8s)]
*  unhoused. And we know that that is another way of putting money aside for migrant families. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  That's got to just be upsetting the Chicago residents. Kata, we've got to leave it there, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=311.76s)]
*  but thank you for the insight of what's happening there. We'll continue to follow this story and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=317.04s)]
*  Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you as well. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ds4iOaRQo&t=320.96000000000004s)]
