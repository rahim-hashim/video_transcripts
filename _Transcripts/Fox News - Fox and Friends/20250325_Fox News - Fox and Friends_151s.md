# Bill Maher to meet Trump at White House, sends message to left-wing critics
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50)
*  And comedian Bill Maher is not listening to critics who are upset over his plans to visit President Trump at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not playing this game that you mean girls play. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=6.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Where like, oh you know what? You can't sit at my lunch table because I'm just not talking to you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  And you also have to respect that, you know, the guy did win. It's more than half the country or whatever. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=15.68s)]
*  I mean, I just, I keep saying it. I'm not going to hate, you can not like Trump. You can hate him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=21.76s)]
*  You can't hate everybody who votes for him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=29.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=30.72s)]
*  I don't hate half the country and I don't want to hate half the country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=31.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's just not where my mind ever wants to go for my own mental health is all this hate. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=34.660000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=40.72s)]
*  So yes, I will talk to anybody. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=41.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=42.56s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's an honor to be invited to the White House under any circumstances. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=43.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=50.08s)]
*  Perfectly reasonable is that. The comedian also joked that he will not dress like Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=51.28s)]
*  He wants to dress for success, guys. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=58.48s)]
*  Yeah, just a soon time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=61.04s)]
*  They asked, what are you going to wear? He's like, I'm not going to dress like Zelensky. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=61.76s)]
*  Obviously that was an issue. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=64.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=66.24s)]
*  I think it's great that Kid Rock's doing this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=69.12s)]
*  Kid Rock connected them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=69.84s)]
*  Dress code. I like that one. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=70.96s)]
*  Thank you very much, Carly. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=72.24s)]
*  Yeah. Kid Rock is brokering a peace summit, essentially. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=73.12s)]
*  Right. And if he has some time, if he could do something with, do something with Russia and Ukraine, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=76.96s)]
*  I like Kid Rock on that one too. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=81.6s)]
*  I like it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  I just think it's incredible that the country is so divided that this is news. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=84.16s)]
*  That someone from the other side goes to the White House to meet with the president. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  That we're so pulled apart that him going to the White House just to meet the Commander in Chief becomes a news story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=91.2s)]
*  And it's only because we're so divided right now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=97.6s)]
*  Yeah, but think about during the Biden years. When was the last time Joe Biden or his team invited somebody who was, you know, from the other silo, so to speak. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=99.6s)]
*  A chance. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=108.16s)]
*  But I would say. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=108.8s)]
*  Don't think of an example. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=109.3s)]
*  Don't you think it makes Bill Barr a better host? So for now, he goes to do his show every Friday, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=110.0s)]
*  So now he can say there's four things going on. If he has a direct communication, which he could probably end that meeting if nothing, no fireworks happen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=114.16s)]
*  He go, hey, could you give me clarification on this? And he can go to his jokes and monologue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  So this has some balance because he invites mostly left leaning people on his show. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=125.12s)]
*  It's amazing the people who paid attention to the election results like Bill Maher did, Fareed Zakaria. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=130.0s)]
*  Some of the people like woke up and said something happened here and I'm out of touch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=134.8s)]
*  But then he still has some of the radicals. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=138.56s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=140.88s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP2X62hwu50&t=141.84s)]
