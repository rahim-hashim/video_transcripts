# McEnany: This is what you do when you don't have facts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU)
*  So first it was deep fakes and now the White House is spinning another deflection as they take heed over their federal hurricane response. Watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=0.0s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation and I beseech you, I beg you to please not pay attention to it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=9.0s)]
*  Sir, what's the risk of political figures sharing misinformation during this time? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=16.0s)]
*  It misleads people, puts people in circumstances where they panic, where they're really, really, really worried. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=22.0s)]
*  So I'm going to divorce the disinformation that is being spread from any one individual and just say this, disinformation harms survivors of a disaster because they lose trust in their government. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=28.0s)]
*  There's not enough money right now for people in North Carolina. That's not misinformation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=43.0s)]
*  Wait, no that is, your whole premise of the question is misinformation, sir. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=48.0s)]
*  What you do, yes, yes, it's misinformation and it's there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=53.0s)]
*  You don't like misinformation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=57.0s)]
*  Outnumbered co-host and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany joins us now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=59.0s)]
*  So Kayleigh, this is like the boy who cried wolf, there's actual disinformation out there, but when you keep crying disinformation, when you really need to warn the public, they don't listen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that exactly yesterday. This discredits your, you know, any assertion you make about disinformation when you are saying that basic questions from the press are misinformation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=73.0s)]
*  Look, Kareen, jump here. Let me just address that last one. When you're press secretary, you have a crisis on your hands. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=83.0s)]
*  Very simple three part thing you do. Number one, call DHS. I would call the Department of Homeland Security and say I want to tick tock of everything you've done. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=88.0s)]
*  I want to know the level of resources you have. Just like I did with COVID, you call the supply chain coordinator, Admiral Plovchek, let me know what PPE you sent out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=96.0s)]
*  Number two, you go talk to the president. Number three, you go talk to the press. What you don't do is scream misinformation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=103.0s)]
*  That's what you do when the facts aren't on your side. And if you do think something's misinformation, don't scream misinformation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=110.0s)]
*  Challenge the premise of the question. Like I would do with Jim Acosta. Hey, Jim, you're quoting Trump there, but you left out the second part of the quote. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=116.0s)]
*  What's the second part of the quote? And he would never have that on hand. Problem is Peter Doocy was exactly right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=123.0s)]
*  Facts were on his side. One hundred fifty seven millions going to Lebanon when people are hurting here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=128.0s)]
*  He had the facts. Kareen Jean Pierre had superfluous talking points. So let's talk about that a little bit because I was just there in North Carolina. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=133.0s)]
*  How's the PR on this? Because when I went down on the ground, you see the people crying out for help. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=141.0s)]
*  You see the private organizations that are on the ground. It's the White House accomplishing anything with it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=146.0s)]
*  Is the American public believing them when they say FEMA is there and and they're managing this perfectly? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=152.0s)]
*  No, I mean, you saw it with your own eyes. You said this morning you see unmarked vehicles, you know, where is the government personnel on the ground? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=158.0s)]
*  I heard save our allies, Tim Kennedy, they're talking in detail and being very gentle in his criticism of how he has been there when the federal government has not. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=166.0s)]
*  Look, are they doing what they can? Sure. They've mismanaged resources entirely. And that doesn't come from FEMA on the ground. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=176.0s)]
*  They're doing good work. It comes from the top. It said all when DHS, when my orcas said we don't have enough we think to get through hurricane season. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=183.0s)]
*  Why money is going to Lebanon and people outside of the places that need it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=192.0s)]
*  Thirty one million Americans in disaster zones in this country. Thirty one million two hundred counties. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=197.0s)]
*  And we're sending money to Lebanon. It's just the parallel and the contrast when you look at it and the American people are giving people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=202.0s)]
*  But when their concerns aren't met, they get a little frustrated about that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=210.0s)]
*  Rightfully so. Kaylee, I'm sure you've had to deal with crisis in the White House. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=214.0s)]
*  I don't think telling the press disinformation was enough when you were back. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=219.0s)]
*  I dealt with all of covid-19 and we listed out every day the mask and PPE we sent out. But that wasn't enough for the press. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=223.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. If you want more, Kaylee, and I know you do, watch outnumbered at noon today. Thank you, Kaylee. Thanks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=229.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ASKIq4KaYU&t=244.0s)]
