# RFK  Jr. vows to clear out entire departments at FDA
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w)
*  With the White House secured, President-elect Trump is ready to enact his Make America Healthy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=0.0s)]
*  Again agenda. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=7.7s)]
*  RFK Jr. says it's time to clear out entire departments in the FDA. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  But what exactly does that look like? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News Senior Medical Analyst Dr. Mark Siegel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=15.98s)]
*  Dr. Siegel, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=19.88s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=21.76s)]
*  What does he want to clean out? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=22.76s)]
*  Well, it sounds like he's focusing mainly, at least to begin with, on the food part of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=23.76s)]
*  FDA. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=28.76s)]
*  The FDA is food, Drug Administration. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=29.8s)]
*  With food, it's a mess. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=32.36s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about 75% of the stuff in supermarkets is ultra-processed foods. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=33.36s)]
*  You know what an ultra-processed food is? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=39.68s)]
*  It can't remember what soil it came from. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  It can't remember what farm it was grown on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  It's been so chemicalized that it doesn't have any connection to the original food it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=46.8s)]
*  was. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=51.24s)]
*  And it's why we have an obesity epidemic in this country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=52.24s)]
*  40% of Americans are obese. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  Leads to all kinds of diseases that I treat. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  Heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, heart attacks, and yes, even cancer, multiple [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  cancers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=64.0s)]
*  So that's a good place to start because we're spending $4 trillion on our health care in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=65.0s)]
*  this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  It's a sick care system, not a health care system. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  And the FDA, and one more point about this, they're also in charge of outbreaks, Ainsley. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  We have over 1,700 multi-state outbreaks of foodborne illness. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=78.86s)]
*  48 million Americans are getting sick from the food they eat every year, and that's also [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=84.1s)]
*  under FDA's umbrella. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=89.06s)]
*  They're very, very limp in that area. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=90.86s)]
*  When we were interviewing R.F.K. Jr., he said some things that were pretty shocking, like [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=93.1s)]
*  French fries at McDonald's, maybe made with three ingredients in Europe, but here made [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=97.14s)]
*  with, I don't remember the number, but 10, 20 ingredients. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=101.86s)]
*  Ingredients that aren't healthy for you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=106.18s)]
*  Different lobes, different dyes, he said, are in our cereal, but the same cereal made [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=107.5s)]
*  in Europe is not allowed to use those products. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=111.46s)]
*  So why, this is America, why are we allowed to put these products that are illegal in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=114.26s)]
*  Europe, and you go to Europe and you eat clean and you feel great after you eat pasta and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=119.42s)]
*  pizza, you don't gain any weight, but here, why are we allowed to put those terrible chemicals [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=123.18s)]
*  in our food that our children are eating? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=126.88s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=129.14s)]
*  We shouldn't be. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=130.14s)]
*  And I just told you, I just returned from Europe. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=131.14s)]
*  I could actually eat pasta and dessert again, and they didn't gain a pound there because [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=132.74s)]
*  it doesn't have those ingredients you're talking about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=137.22s)]
*  Canada also doesn't have it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=139.9s)]
*  Fruit loops here in the United States, multiple chemicals, and as R.F.K. Jr. says, in Canada, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=141.78s)]
*  two or three ingredients. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=146.34s)]
*  We don't police the amount of chemicals in our foods. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=147.84s)]
*  They also interfere with fertility. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=150.9s)]
*  That's one I didn't mention. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=152.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=153.5s)]
*  And when you become obese, you get diabetes a lot of the time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=154.5s)]
*  Then you have other multiple problems. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=157.38s)]
*  Now, he has a history as a social reformer, environmental activist. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=159.1s)]
*  That's his background. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=163.86s)]
*  So I'm very interested in his approach towards the food we eat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=164.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=167.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=168.78s)]
*  You also have a great op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, and it talks about marijuana. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=169.78s)]
*  It's not your parents' woodstock weed, but recreational can be misleading. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=172.14s)]
*  So everyone, go and watch that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=176.62s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=178.82s)]
*  I mean, go and read that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=179.82s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=180.82s)]
*  Because it's the THC content. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=181.82s)]
*  It's the chemicals in our pot, 30 to 60%. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=182.82s)]
*  Back when I was a kid, it was 1.5% in Europe. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=185.48s)]
*  In Switzerland, it's 1%. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=188.2s)]
*  It's not the same thing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=190.06s)]
*  Go out on the streets here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=191.14s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=192.14s)]
*  You smell it everywhere. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=193.14s)]
*  I feel like if I'm walking behind someone, I smell it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=194.32s)]
*  I just don't want to breathe that in. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=196.88s)]
*  You've got to, right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=199.08s)]
*  It's secondhand. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=200.08s)]
*  You're picking it up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=201.08s)]
*  You've got to walk on the other side of the street. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=202.08s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=203.08s)]
*  You smell it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=204.08s)]
*  You can't. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=205.08s)]
*  You can't avoid it in New York now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=206.08s)]
*  Dr. Siegel, thank you so much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=207.08s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpHLeR1pU_w&t=208.08s)]
