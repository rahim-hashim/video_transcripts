# 'UNACCEPTABLE': Louisiana lt gov rips New Orleans city leadership following terror attack
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM)
*  Well, here to discuss that and more is the lieutenant governor of Louisiana, Billy Nungesser. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Lieutenant Governor, welcome to the show. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=5.96s)]
*  Let's just quickly get your response. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=7.84s)]
*  And we're all grieving for what happened in your state in that fabulous city. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=9.8s)]
*  And it's just, it's heart wrenching and outrageous that this terrorist struck. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=13.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, it looks like there were maybe some preventative measures that were not deployed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  that day on a major tourist event. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=22.32s)]
*  And now we have the head of the police force in that city saying she didn't realize that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=25.28s)]
*  those tools even existed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=28.98s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=30.94s)]
*  I'm outraged. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=31.94s)]
*  Angry. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=32.94s)]
*  Since I got elected lieutenant governor, we've been fighting with the administration to make [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=33.94s)]
*  the French Quarter safer. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=40.82s)]
*  And it wasn't until Jeff Landry put a state police troop in the French Quarter, we saw [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=42.66s)]
*  great progress to save the French Quarter before this incident. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=48.18s)]
*  And our lack of leadership from the top on down to know those barricades were taken [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=52.46s)]
*  out with New Year's in the Sugar Bowl is unacceptable. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=58.26s)]
*  Yeah, they were apparently upgrading security for the Super Bowl, which is fine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  It makes sense to do that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=67.82s)]
*  But then leaving that area filled with tourists vulnerable on such a huge day, New Year's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=69.38s)]
*  Eve and a New Year's Day, the football game, as you mentioned, obviously a terrible failure. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=74.94s)]
*  There have been critics pointing this out now for a number of days, prompting this response. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=80.14s)]
*  I want to read this to you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=84.86s)]
*  This is from the mayor's office in New Orleans, quoting the city of New Orleans will not be [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=85.86s)]
*  distracted by outside commentary and welcomes everyone to join the positive efforts of the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=91.34s)]
*  unified command partners. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=97.94s)]
*  Outside commentary, Lieutenant Governor, that seems like they're kind of poo pooing this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=101.48s)]
*  or minimizing it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  I've been working with her administration for eight years to put a plan together to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=108.78s)]
*  manage the quarter. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=112.5s)]
*  She couldn't even give out a garbage contract to get the quarter cleaned up before Sugar [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=114.1s)]
*  Bowl. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=118.8s)]
*  The city council had to give out an emergency contract because she gave it to someone that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=119.8s)]
*  wasn't in that business. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=123.88s)]
*  For two years, we've been trying to get the post around Jackson Square replaced. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=125.61999999999999s)]
*  There is no protection to Jackson Square. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  I put a video out yesterday. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  You can drive through that pedestrian mall around Jackson Square by the St. Louis Cathedral [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=135.48s)]
*  without even stopping. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=142.32s)]
*  A car could run right through there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=143.32s)]
*  It's absurd, her lack of leadership, while she travels the world and leaves this city [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=145.76s)]
*  unprotected. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=151.12s)]
*  Everyone should be outraged. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I just want to ask you quickly, finally, in the months to come, as you mentioned, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Super Bowl is coming. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=159.44s)]
*  There's going to be Mardi Gras, as there is every year. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=160.44s)]
*  Are you confident by those major events that tourists and people should feel safe in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=162.48s)]
*  city of New Orleans moving forward? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=168.64s)]
*  Our governor, Jeff Landry, just like we put the state police in the quarter, I have no [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  doubt he will take charge of this and make this the safest city and be the safest Super [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=175.52s)]
*  Bowl ever. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=181.5s)]
*  I have all the confidence in the governor. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=182.5s)]
*  He's been leaning forward since elected to clean up the quarter and make it safe. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=184.72s)]
*  And I think he will take charge of this and make it happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=189.2s)]
*  All right, Mr. Lieutenant Governor, again, our hearts go out to everyone down in Louisiana [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=191.8s)]
*  and that affected community. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=195.72s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time this morning. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rXVkahNiaM&t=197.0s)]
