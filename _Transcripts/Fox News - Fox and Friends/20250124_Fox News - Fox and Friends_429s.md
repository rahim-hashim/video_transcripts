# Newsom set to 'crash' Trump's LA visit to see fire devastation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18)
*  All right, today, the president is making his first trip of his second term, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=0.0s)]
*  stopping in storm ravage, western North Carolina, before heading out to Los Angeles [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=4.16s)]
*  to survey all the damage from the wildfires. And those trips come after Donald Trump expressed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=8.0s)]
*  frustration with FEMA. Jackie Heinrich is live from the hard-hit Asheville with the details. Hey, Jackie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=12.72s)]
*  Good morning to you guys. Yeah, this community is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=20.48s)]
*  which hit in late September. The Japanese restaurant behind me is in ruins. There are still, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=25.2s)]
*  there's rubble all over the parking lot. I'll have my camera pan off so you can see what I'm [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=30.8s)]
*  talking about. And also, early this month, about 3,000 people were reportedly told that their hotel [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=34.0s)]
*  vouchers were expiring. They had only days notice, nowhere to go. Congressman Chuck Edwards, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=40.8s)]
*  he's a Republican who represents this district, had to lobby that agency to give people at least [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  21 days notice. And he says that they agreed, but he's also called for an agency overhaul. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=51.04s)]
*  He'll be joining the president today. Now, President Trump did not telegraph much about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=57.04s)]
*  FEMA overhauls that he is planning, but there are proposals to shift more of the recovery [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  burden to states or potentially condition it on preparedness. It follows criticism that FEMA has [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=67.36s)]
*  been biased against Republicans. Recall that the agency fired an employee on its hurricane [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=73.28s)]
*  relief team after telling first responders not to visit Florida homes that had Trump yard signs [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=78.08s)]
*  after Hurricane Milton. And there was a lot of criticism about FEMA's response to the hurricane [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=83.28s)]
*  here in Asheville, saying that it was too slow. Our country can no longer deliver basic services [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=87.84s)]
*  in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=94.72s)]
*  who have been treated so badly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=102.56s)]
*  And other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=108.56s)]
*  or more recently Los Angeles, where we're watching fires still tragically burn [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=114.08s)]
*  from weeks ago without even a token of defense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=120.08s)]
*  Now, the New York Times writes this morning, Trump says states should manage disasters. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=126.32s)]
*  Former FEMA leaders agree, quote, the past four administrators of FEMA, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=130.8s)]
*  two appointed by Democrats and two appointed by Mr. Trump, have made versions of that argument, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=134.4s)]
*  calling for states to do more. But states generally want more help, not less. Now, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=139.28s)]
*  conditioning aid is a controversial proposal. Historically, Congress has passed bipartisan [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  disaster supplementals on a bipartisan basis. But after California's fires, which are expected to be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=149.28s)]
*  the most expensive natural disaster in American history, Trump has threatened to withhold help [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=155.2s)]
*  if the state does not amend its forest and water management policies. And today, after he leaves [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  North Carolina, the president will head to California and Governor Gavin Newsom will be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=167.28s)]
*  scrambling onto that tarmac to greet the president, saying he wants to have a conversation, guys. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  All right. So hopefully there'll be some unscripted moments in North Carolina where people can voice [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  their concern. And in California, you really, anything can happen in California because the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=182.4s)]
*  fires are still raging. The governor and the president aren't really speaking. There's really [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=187.68s)]
*  no Republican outside Darrell Issa to meet him on the tarmac. All right. Thank you, Jackie. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=192.16s)]
*  Thank you, Jackie. That's right. Thanks, guys. So looking at that footage that Jackie has of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=197.76s)]
*  North Carolina, I look at Florida and they have hurricanes all the time. You got Ronda Sanchez, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=203.52s)]
*  and he clears those streets up fast, fast. He has the line workers there to get the electricity up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=208.8s)]
*  The fact that this place looks almost the same as four months ago show you there's a failure of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=215.36s)]
*  leadership that I'm so glad that the president is going down there to give those folks some help [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  because I feel like as the L.A. fires have gotten in the news, I've been getting messages from the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=225.84s)]
*  folks back there. They feel forgotten. They feel like everybody's forgotten about their story and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=230.56s)]
*  they're still dealing with a lot of the consequences of that storm. Yeah, Franklin Graham was with us [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=234.48s)]
*  when we were at the inauguration and he said there's a lot that still needs to be cleaned up in North [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=240.48s)]
*  Carolina. There's a headline in Politico because once the president's in North Carolina, he's going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=245.04s)]
*  to leave and go out to California. And Jackie was just mentioning this. It says Newsom plans to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=250.16s)]
*  crash Trump's L.A. wildfire visit. And in the article, it says this is Gavin Newsom. I look [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=253.6s)]
*  forward to being there on the tarmac to thank the president, welcoming him. And we are making sure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=258.96s)]
*  that all the resources he needs for a successful briefing are provided to him. There's no limit to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=263.6s)]
*  the resources we'll provide for that briefing. And in the article, it says that Newsom's been [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=268.0s)]
*  trying to get in touch with him and Trump hasn't returned his calls and they haven't talked since [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=272.8s)]
*  the president left office in 2020. Yeah, how about why did you cut the budget to the fire department? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Why is your homeless budget double that of the firefighters? Why did you not listen to the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  firefighters union and say they weren't ready? Why was it okay to have a reservoir totally empty [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=288.88s)]
*  and another one not working? Why was there no backup generator plan for when you did lose power [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=294.4s)]
*  that the fire hydrants were replenished with some type of generator? And I saw Nicole Shanahan on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=299.92s)]
*  last night who was the running mate of RFK when it was brief run for independent president. And she [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=307.6s)]
*  says people are constantly running up to Gavin Newsom saying I've been trying to clear the brush [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=312.24s)]
*  in the park lands behind my house. No one is coming out to do it. And there's a big push [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=316.72s)]
*  from Democrats as well as Republicans that have always been pushed to clean up the forests ahead [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=322.48s)]
*  of the guaranteed wildfires. So he's got water and he's got forest cleanup that he will not address. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=328.8s)]
*  Operative word guaranteed. We knew this was going to happen. They expect fires, especially with those [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=336.8s)]
*  Santa Ana winds, and it hasn't rained there for a while. It will this weekend, thankfully. Hope [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=341.68s)]
*  there aren't many mudslides or any at all. But they're used to this in California. You have to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=345.76s)]
*  get the forests fixed and you have to have water. So the narrative from the left is that the president [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=350.24s)]
*  is politically targeting the people of California. That's not true. Spoke with the president yesterday. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  He said he cares about the people. They're American citizens. He wants to, he goes, I'm trying to help [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=360.24s)]
*  them. He goes, a conversation with Gavin Newsom is a non-starter unless he wants to release the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=365.44s)]
*  water from the north. Fix up, take the brush out. He goes, I told them this years ago and he didn't [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  listen. And now you've got the people that are struggling. So if we're going to have a conversation [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=377.68s)]
*  by progress, those things have to be on the table. Gavin is going to be there to greet the president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=381.76s)]
*  I hope that he's prepared to have a tough conversation about what they can do to move the state forward. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=387.36s)]
*  Well, they got to make decisions on if they can rebuild in these areas or are they too problematic. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=393.68s)]
*  Number two, you got to that red tape. That's environmental red tape. They have all these [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=398.88s)]
*  qualifications. Number three, the water and number four, insurance. We as a country going to underwrite [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  all of California because they refuse to let these carriers raise their rates so the carriers [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=408.32s)]
*  pull out. So should we be handling their insurance? We'll be following it all day. I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGboP2yoN18&t=413.92s)]
