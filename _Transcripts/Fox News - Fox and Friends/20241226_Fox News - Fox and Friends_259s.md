# Major companies donate to Trump's inaugural fund as tariff threat looms
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE)
*  Toyota joining other major auto companies like Ford and General Motors in making [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=0.0s)]
*  $1,000,000 donation to President-elect Trump's inaugural fund [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=5.4s)]
*  It all comes in the wake of Trump's proposed 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada that would leave a big impact on the auto industry [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=9.56s)]
*  Here with reaction host of the David Webb show and Fox News contributor David Webb David. Hope you had a great Christmas [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=16.8s)]
*  Let's die. I did. Thank you. You do brief [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=23.44s)]
*  Let's dive right in the Wall Street Journal [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=25.96s)]
*  Frame this as saying that all the big business people from Silicon Valley to Wall Street and beyond our [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=28.32s)]
*  Shores are coming to kiss the ring bend the knee and cut the check Toyota being the latest look at the list of companies [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=35.2s)]
*  Though you can see from Toyota for General Motors, but it's also [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  Amazon meta open AI uber Goldman Sachs Bank America the list goes on and on many of them making [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=47.64s)]
*  Million dollar or more donations. Why do you think that so many business folks are coming to try in? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  Curry favor really is what it looks like with President-elect Trump [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=62.32s)]
*  Well, maybe their memory goes back a little bit if you look at the first Trump administration [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=66.0s)]
*  Businesses did better the economy did better and to be fair. They want a seat at the table [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=72.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is taking in what some estimated? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=77.8s)]
*  Possible about two hundred twenty five million dollars in total donations. They want to see it at the table [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=82.44s)]
*  They're gonna be discussions on policy regulatory policy [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=88.44s)]
*  Across the board and that's important but in the Trump administration just being at the table doesn't guarantee you the outcome [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  Because it's tough to buy Trump as I like to say and on top of that when you look at it Griffey's got Doge [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  So anyone who thinks they're going to get back into heavy crony capitalism [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Buying their way in we've seen that in the Biden administration. We saw that with the cylindras in the Obama Biden [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=112.04s)]
*  Administration more with the Democrats that's not going to happen here [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=118.92s)]
*  And there's a watchdog in Doge that we need an efficient government and we also don't need outside influence [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  When as the president has talked about it needs to be the government working for the people not the other way around [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=128.72s)]
*  So what do you make of already? We're seeing Democrats like Democrat congresswoman Jasmine Crockett [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=135.0s)]
*  That's saying about the inaugural money fund that that the Doge boys should immediately start cutting that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=140.92s)]
*  Let me show our viewers by the way, just how it stacks up Trump's inaugural committee already exceeding a hundred and fifty million dollars [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=147.44s)]
*  You go back only a hundred and seven million for Trump's first term [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=155.16s)]
*  But in 2021 only sixty two million for Biden Democrats are saying aha. This is where the Doge boys should start cutting right away [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=158.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=166.4s)]
*  Here's my words for everyone ignore Jasmine Crockett [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=167.6s)]
*  She basically has nothing of value to say I've watched her all her time in Congress [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=171.16s)]
*  Focus on what's happening. They need a new evil Empire, right? First Trump was all a fascist white supremacist [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=176.84s)]
*  He was basically Hitler and they went after him that way then they went to President Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  They're sending the same memos around now [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=189.6s)]
*  They need to attack Doge because the fact is there's an actual plan in place to help clean up government and if that happens [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=192.0s)]
*  They lose some of their influence [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=199.4s)]
*  We don't know how much but we already have a plan in place and you have a seat at the table the real seat at [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  The table is the EV mandate with Ilana and Vivek that we need to make sure government is efficient and make sure it's not just [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=206.96s)]
*  For the Trump years, but going forward there's a lot of work to be done and the Jasmine Crockett's of the world [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=214.12s)]
*  They don't like that the power players the elitist frankly in both parties [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Don't like that Trump's coming in with a mandate from the people that we need a change in direction [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, and I think there's a case to be made David that the center of the economic universe no longer runs right now through [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=231.16s)]
*  Silicon Valley or Wall Street, but perhaps through Mar-a-Lago in perhaps they see a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=236.94s)]
*  Opportunity and better days ahead David Webb. Thank you for taking time getting up with us the day after Christmas [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=242.2s)]
*  Anytime I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akogtLbRZZE&t=248.1s)]
