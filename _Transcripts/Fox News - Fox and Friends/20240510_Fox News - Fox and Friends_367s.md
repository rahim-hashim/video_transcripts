# White House scrambling after Biden's Rafah decision
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA)
*  White House is still scrambling, scrambling after President Biden's CNN interview earlier [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=0.0s)]
*  this week, where he threatened to stop sending weapons to Israel if they move forward with [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=3.72s)]
*  the RAFA offensive. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=8.14s)]
*  Actually, he did stop. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=9.14s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=10.14s)]
*  Madeline. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=12.14s)]
*  Hey, good morning, guys. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=13.14s)]
*  Republicans are accusing President Biden of giving in to the demands of the far left flank. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Now, the president must also navigate the growing rift between the anti- and pro-Israel [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=19.26s)]
*  factions of his own party. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=23.86s)]
*  Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman says, for instance, hard disagree and deeply disappointing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=25.86s)]
*  On the other hand, progressives believe the president's decision to condition aid to Israel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=32.18s)]
*  is a sign that protests like the ones roiling college campuses are working. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=36.9s)]
*  Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal says, I commend the president for heeding this call to ensure [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  we protect innocent Palestinian lives and refuse to supply weapons to ensure no more [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=46.82s)]
*  civilians in Gaza are killed as a consequence of U.S. bombs. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=51.72s)]
*  A Democratic mega donor also says, bad, bad decision on all levels. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=55.92s)]
*  Please reconsider. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=60.32s)]
*  Let's not forget that there are more Jewish voters who care about Israel than Muslim voters [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=61.84s)]
*  that care about Hamas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=65.98s)]
*  Let's listen once more to the president's red line. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=67.84s)]
*  I made it clear that if they go into RAFA, they haven't gone into RAFA yet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=70.32s)]
*  If they go into RAFA, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  deal with RAFA. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=82.0s)]
*  We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=83.0s)]
*  ability to respond to attacks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=88.04s)]
*  The White House, though, thinks the president's comments should come as no surprise, as they've [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=91.0s)]
*  been signaling their position for some time now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  They also make clear the shipments they're targeting is not from the foreign aid package [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=98.4s)]
*  that Congress approved last month. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=101.94s)]
*  The president and his team have been clear for several weeks that we do not support a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=105.16s)]
*  major ground operation in RAFA, where more than a million people are sheltering with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=109.84s)]
*  nowhere safe to go. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=115.16s)]
*  President has said that publicly, and he has communicated that repeatedly and straightforwardly [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=117.96s)]
*  to Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  Former White House spokesperson Jen Psaki says the president should have acted sooner. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=126.4s)]
*  I do think that there is some leverage that we are all seeing being used. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=131.88s)]
*  Should it have been used earlier? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=136.48s)]
*  I think the answer is yes to that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=137.76s)]
*  But we are seeing them hold back in the sending of weapons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=139.72s)]
*  That's actually a pretty significant sign. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to submit a highly anticipated report to Congress [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  regarding whether Israel followed international law in its operation in Gaza. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=151.0s)]
*  Axios reports this could happen as soon as today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=155.56s)]
*  Will Ainsley and Brian. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=159.64s)]
*  All right. Thank you, Mylan. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  In her report, she talked about that letter from this big mega donor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=162.4s)]
*  He's a billionaire. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=166.52s)]
*  He's number 23 on Forbes richest American list. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=167.52s)]
*  And his net worth is like $2.8 billion. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=171.16s)]
*  But he said he thinks it's a bad decision and we need to reconsider. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=173.44s)]
*  There are more Jewish voters than there are that care about Israel than there are Muslim [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=177.0s)]
*  voters. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=180.96s)]
*  It's Christianity is our number one religion. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=181.96s)]
*  Sixty three percent. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=184.36s)]
*  Judaism is number two. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=185.6s)]
*  So if he really cares about the voters and it seems that he's pandering to the voters [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  in Michigan and Wisconsin by going back on this and holding back the weapons, he needs [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=191.6s)]
*  to think about that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=195.32s)]
*  There are more Jewish people and many people I've talked to that are Jewish are saying [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=196.32s)]
*  they're now they're not voting for him because of this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=199.76s)]
*  Well, that'll be fascinating to see because that has been a vote that the Democrats have [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  been able to rely on, similar to how they've been able to rely on the black vote. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=205.88s)]
*  Cutting off aid. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=210.16s)]
*  That is something that Joe Biden said he would not do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=211.16s)]
*  Almost incensed at the idea in 2019. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  The idea that we would cut off military aid to an ally or only true, true ally in the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=219.76s)]
*  entire region is absolutely preposterous. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=230.6s)]
*  It's just beyond my comprehension. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=233.84s)]
*  Anyone would do that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  I was in 2019, Brian, and he was talking directly about Israel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=238.44s)]
*  So a couple of things here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  I wish we didn't even worry about the voters. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=243.64s)]
*  There's certain times in life you have to do what you're supposed to do. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=245.28s)]
*  The guy's 80 something years old. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=248.92s)]
*  But he does seem to care about the voters because he's backpedaling. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=249.92s)]
*  And by the way, Jen Psaki just revealed where most of the Democratic Party is. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=252.92s)]
*  He should have she's telling Stephen Colbert, we the president should have done this earlier, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=256.52s)]
*  threatened Israel instead of trying to find out what the right numbers are, how you fight [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=262.4s)]
*  in an urban environment, talk to a military person about what exactly Israel is doing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=266.04s)]
*  and what their objective is. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=270.0s)]
*  They quickly got to say, well, there's protests on campus. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=271.68s)]
*  Michigan's going south. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=274.68s)]
*  So that's why the president should take weapons away. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=276.28s)]
*  How about our allies of democracy? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=278.76s)]
*  They were attacked October 7th. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=280.88s)]
*  Worst time since the 1940s. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=282.68s)]
*  A guy who was Hitler was presiding over it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=285.28s)]
*  Hamas just as bad. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  Only there's more of them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  And now you just ask yourself this question. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=289.88s)]
*  What's the objective to wipe out Hamas? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Where are they in Rafa? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  How many are left? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  Eight thousand. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=296.24s)]
*  Where's the head? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=297.24s)]
*  Where's the head man? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=298.56s)]
*  Sinwar. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=299.72s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=300.72s)]
*  In the tunnels of Rafa. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=301.72s)]
*  Why would you not go in? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=303.56s)]
*  How dare you not allow a country that was just lost 2200 people in a brutal massacre, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=305.36s)]
*  including young people at a concert for peace. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=312.12s)]
*  How dare you tell them they can't go in and get the people responsible? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's what he should be saying. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=320.24s)]
*  Every person that dies is on Hamas's hands. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=321.76s)]
*  And don't forget, there are American hostages that are being held still within. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=324.52s)]
*  Yeah, he never brings that up. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=328.68s)]
*  No. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=330.12s)]
*  He never brings up the hostages either. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=331.12s)]
*  Everybody wants hostages out. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  That's the only reason why these other guys are still alive. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  But the other thing to keep in mind too is that the president of the United States could [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  be also defining for people the reason why hospitals are hit is because they're headquarters [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=341.12s)]
*  for Hamas. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  The reason why playgrounds and schools are hit is because they're weapons depots for [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=350.0s)]
*  It would be great if the president said that once in a while instead of when he finally [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=351.0s)]
*  does an interview just throwing Israel under the bus. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPzvjstMQA&t=354.56s)]
