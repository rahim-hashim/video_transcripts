*  up marrying you by the they have 3 kids together. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=30.480000000000004s)]
*  But you went through a rough spot and that rough saw spot [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=33.68s)]
*  became sort of something you overcame and then you had a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  springtime so talk to us about that rough spot what got you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=40.86s)]
*  out of it and this renewal of your marriage people want to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=43.96s)]
*  hear about that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, we do have that the book is encouragement, it's like a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=48.34s)]
*  love letter to people because I think a lot of people are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  discouraged about [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=53.94s)]
*  marriage or family or faith or all of that and we do hope that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=55.8s)]
*  it's encouragement but we went through a time where we were [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=58.96s)]
*  miscarrying there was infertility he just parted ways [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  with his band. That was very difficult. His mom was dying of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=65.24s)]
*  MS it was just like thing after thing after thing and we didn't [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  feel that we had even enough to encourage each other with both [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=73.88s)]
*  of us were hit really hot. Yeah, and so in that time I [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  think all we need to do was trust God in the pain that he [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=80.62s)]
*  was going to somehow redeem it and draw close to each other we [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=84.3s)]
*  pursued curiosity we which I consider the 6th love language [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=87.48s)]
*  is 5 love languages right we know about that but the 6th [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=91.48s)]
*  love language of asking questions like drawing him out [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=94.42s)]
*  not staying isolated because they're not paying I think [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=97.36s)]
*  often we can isolate. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=99.46s)]
*  What about the spring House up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=101.2s)]
*  Well, let me just because you mentioned so that I think it's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=103.06s)]
*  important to the story and that is kind of you are in a band [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=105.86s)]
*  that everyone knows foster the people had that song pumped up [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=108.94s)]
*  kicks and you broke from that in for anyone that's dealt with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=112.06s)]
*  a sick parent and then watch their parents suffering. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=116.02s)]
*  It's a tragedy and it's very difficult you go through all [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=119.46s)]
*  these changes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=122.26s)]
*  Your path to Rebecca into God how did that go how was it like. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=124.1s)]
*  Yeah, so actually met Rebecca kind of in the infants infancy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=130.04s)]
*  stages of the band so she was kind of with me in the journey [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=133.18s)]
*  through the blissful years of getting to travel the world and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=135.52s)]
*  do all the fun things together and so really the first couple [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=138.28s)]
*  of years of marriage were fantastic. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  We're kind of scratching our heads saying hey I thought this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  was meant to be hard and then suddenly we're thrust into the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=144.54s)]
*  complete opposite where it just felt like blow after blow after [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=147.34s)]
*  blow and we're just felt like under 10 feet of snow. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=150.02s)]
*  And so I think it was in that moment that that really I was [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  forced to live by faith, contempt for the first time in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=155.12s)]
*  my life because I was met by silence desperately crying out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=157.82s)]
*  for the Lord on what to do next who I am what what what what [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=161.56s)]
*  is my purpose anymore and met with silence so is forced to go [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=165.1s)]
*  back to what I knew God said and what I knew God was which [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  was good and stand on the rock of of his scriptures and the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=172.86s)]
*  foundation of who he is to carry us through those [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  challenging times. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=179.62s)]
*  It is remarkable, you know so much of culture today in [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=180.9s)]
*  America in particular. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=183.66000000000003s)]
*  Sort of degrades marriage and acts like it's not you know an [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  important part of life but but you know you look at people who [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=189.0s)]
*  are married and who make it succeed. It's you know you live [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=191.94s)]
*  longer you live happier you have wonderful you know the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  payoffs are extraordinary. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=199.3s)]
*  It's interesting because before I met cover I talked a lot [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=201.9s)]
*  about waiting for marriage and I have this love song to my [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=204.74s)]
*  future husband call wait for me and it was one of my bigger [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  songs. I was on Fox a lot actually talking about that with [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=210.4s)]
*  Hannity and and then so to to meet him and you know in my [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=213.84s)]
*  early 30's and have this dream come true and it is great it's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  worth the wait like I think what we also say is God's way is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=222.08s)]
*  beautiful and not that we're going to get a perfect we need [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=225.32s)]
*  forgiveness and grace just like anyone else. But his way is the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=227.88s)]
*  perfect and good and we're so thankful for the season and he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2TOSo8uQV8&t=231.12s)]
