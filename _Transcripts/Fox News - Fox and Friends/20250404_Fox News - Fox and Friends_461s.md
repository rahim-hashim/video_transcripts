*  Why was he still in our country? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=200.12s)]
*  And the argument is well this happens every day why is it a big deal he's an illegal immigrant [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=204.2s)]
*  You know my answer is because it's all preventable [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  There are things that happen in life that you can't help [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=210.79999999999998s)]

*  You make sense of what's happening here, and you don't blame the previous administration [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=243.4s)]
*  When people have a problem with Donald Trump deporting illegal immigrants criminals people [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=247.39999999999998s)]

*  Frequent in our country and the frustrating thing is that he was detained by ice in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=331.76s)]
*  2016 under the Obama administration [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=337.88s)]
*  Released the very next day and has managed to evade apprehension because quite frankly [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=340.2s)]
*  He's just not been able to appear and now it has resulted in just yet another tragedy in our backyard [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=345.92s)]

*  But what's scary is the people that are here that were allowed to come over under the Biden administration? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=363.16s)]
*  And as people like this that they're changing American lives families that are true victims and good people [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=368.84000000000003s)]

*  We've never seen anything like it the response by the Trump administration early [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=399.08s)]
*  Is that he is doing exactly what he said that he was going to do and he's doing it at record speed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=403.6s)]
*  Despite the courts sometimes despite the outcry from the left [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=409.24s)]

*  How many lives like this are touched because of crimes that are committed by illegal immigrants that should have never? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs46CIDwE98&t=426.92s)]
