# Trump threatens new tariff, calls out 'grossly incompetent' Gov. Newsom
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8)
*  Also, the administration is talking about the film industry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=0.0s)]
*  We've seen all these tariffs, and now Donald Trump is saying there's a tariff on the Hollywood [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  industry or the film industry if you go and you make a movie in another country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=8.88s)]
*  And there are ways to do this, where you can use it with AI and with green screens. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=12.48s)]
*  You can make it look like you're in Italy and just film your movie here in America so [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=16.38s)]
*  that our economies, our states get to keep the money here in America. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  So Donald Trump was talking about this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=24.7s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=26.8s)]
*  Film industry has been decimated by other countries taking them out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=28.36s)]
*  And also by incompetence, like in Los Angeles, the governor is a grossly incompetent man. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=33.04s)]
*  He's just allowed it to be taken away from, you know, Hollywood. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=37.36s)]
*  Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=41.24s)]
*  They have the nice sign and everything's good, but they don't do very much. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=44.24s)]
*  A lot of it's been taken to other countries and a big proportion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=47.84s)]
*  And I'm actually going to meet with some because, you know, there are some advantages, I guess, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  and I'm not looking to hurt the industry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  I want to help the industry. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=57.56s)]
*  So we're going to meet with the industry. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  I want to make sure they're happy with it because we're all about jobs. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  That's all what I'm, you know, it's very important. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=64.44s)]
*  It's a big industry, but it's an industry now that's it's really left. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=66.88s)]
*  It's abandoned the USA where it started. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=71.72s)]
*  And we'll get it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=76.12s)]
*  We'll get it back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=77.12s)]
*  So Brian, I guess there's a little bit of disagreement on the capture. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=78.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=81.04s)]
*  Because you say, look, they distort their own industry with all the woke policies and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=82.04s)]
*  all that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=85.88s)]
*  But I think that this is America first in the sense you can still get out of California. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=86.96s)]
*  You can go to Texas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=92.6s)]
*  You can go to Georgia and go to Nashville, South Carolina, exactly. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=93.6s)]
*  New York was offering tax credits to have these movies there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=97.8s)]
*  They can change the scenery to make it look like another place. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  I don't think because some of in the industry have become woke that you destroy the entire [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=105.32s)]
*  industry. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  One thing when they bring up AI in the industry, they go crazy because if you could start generating, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  you can generate fake people and destroy the acting profession. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=116.02s)]
*  That's one thing they want to strike with. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=118.94s)]
*  Number two is when you have these other countries offer these extremely good packages, if you [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=121.0s)]
*  are trying to find the best deal possible, that's why you go to Egypt. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  That's why you go to Romania. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=129.84s)]
*  Romania is like the hottest place to do movies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=130.84s)]
*  Isn't it more expensive to take your whole crew to another country? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=133.1s)]
*  Or judging by how much it's here with the insurance costs and with the unions that they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=136.54s)]
*  other states, the prices are through the roof. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=143.86s)]
*  Brian, that's the same argument that businesses make. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=146.66000000000003s)]
*  They say, look, we can go make the product for cheaper in China, but they're using slave [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=149.62s)]
*  labor and all that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  It's the same argument just in a different industry. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  They will play the going rates, let's say, in Romania. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  They're not going to impoverished states. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=161.52s)]
*  For example, they're shooting a movie about Saddam Hussein's days in captivity after he [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  got caught. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  They're shooting in Egypt. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=168.44000000000003s)]
*  It's a perfect backdrop. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  The United States got incredible sites, and it is really affordable from the go there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  So if they want to go there and do a movie for less money, maybe give the actors more [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=175.2s)]
*  of the money, instead of Arizona, why should you stop them from doing that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=180.12s)]
*  I guarantee some of these governors are going to hear this now, and they're going to say, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=184.2s)]
*  we will give you incentives. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  You won't have to pay taxes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  They know about it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  Believe me, they'll go to the highest bidder. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  Do you think that any of these American actors want to go spend three months in Romania, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  but it's so financially beneficial and it's so hard to make a profit on movies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=198.84s)]
*  As you know, there's no back end with the streaming stuff that they have no choice. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=203.18s)]
*  I think what he's got to do, John Voight met with them that spurred this whole movement, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=206.5s)]
*  just like Nick Saban spurred the NIL talk. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=210.08s)]
*  So find people who are experts in the business. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=212.52s)]
*  Say why are you in Romania? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  Why are you shooting over in Morocco? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=216.34s)]
*  It's the Middle Eastern countries especially, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Why are you shooting over there? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=222.8s)]
*  What could we do to bring you back here? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=224.12s)]
*  Stop with the non-binary key grip or else you don't get an Oscar. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=225.98s)]
*  You can't hire the best people because you've got to make sure everybody's diverse enough [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=230.92s)]
*  and politically correct enough. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=236.6s)]
*  Hollywood did this to themselves, but now it's almost impossible to be here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=239.12s)]
*  We rolled the clip in during the day of Rob Lowe. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=242.33999999999997s)]
*  Rob Lowe, who lives in Los Angeles, has to shoot the floor in Ireland because it's cost [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=244.56s)]
*  prohibitive to shoot it here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=250.48s)]
*  So meet with the people in the eye of the storm. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=252.22s)]
*  Is there not a way to say to all the governors, what is your bid? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=254.9s)]
*  This is what Ireland's bidding and these are our costs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=259.14s)]
*  I need it to be less than Ireland. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=262.62s)]
*  And one of the governors you don't think would say, shoot it here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=264.44s)]
*  We'll use all of our people in our state to build you a set where it looks like it's in Ireland. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=267.36s)]
*  It's going to be a fascinating debate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=271.36s)]
*  I'm Steve Juicy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=273.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxdgL4QjCC8&t=274.02000000000004s)]
