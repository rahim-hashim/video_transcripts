# 'MAJOR ESCALATION': Russia reportedly launches intercontinental ballistic missile toward Ukraine
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs)
*  The Ukrainian Air Force saying Russia has fired an intercontinental ballistic missile [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=0.0s)]
*  in the central eastern city of Dnipro. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=5.68s)]
*  If true, this would be the first known use of these powerful nuclear-capable missiles. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And this as the U.S. Embassy in Kiev has reopened following an urgent warning that Russia might [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=13.92s)]
*  launch a significant air attack on the capital city. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=18.72s)]
*  Tensions remain high in the region after Ukraine used long-range British missiles and American-made [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=22.32s)]
*  ballistic missiles to strike Russian territory for the first time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=27.8s)]
*  President Biden also expanding Ukraine's arsenal by agreeing to give the country anti-personnel landmines. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  The landmines that we would look to provide them would be landmines that are not persistent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=38.36s)]
*  You know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate, and that makes it far more safer [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  eventually than the things that they are creating on their own. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=56.28s)]
*  John Elliott is the former Trump National Security aide and author of the new book, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  The Biden-Harris Betrayal, Weak and Woke on the World Stage. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=64.28s)]
*  And John joins me now. John, good morning to you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=67.88s)]
*  So how big of a deal is this news that Ukraine is saying that Russia has fired an intercontinental [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=69.64s)]
*  ballistic missile for the first time? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=75.8s)]
*  Well, Carly, good morning. It's absolutely a big deal if it's true. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=78.68s)]
*  Just as you said, what this is, this would represent a major escalation by Russia in the war against Ukraine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=82.28s)]
*  And this follows on what the Biden administration did just the last couple of days. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  They allowed for attacks, directly long-range attacks, 130, 190 miles, up to 190 miles into the territory of Russia [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=92.76s)]
*  that's never been authorized before. These are U.S. weapons that are now authorized to go directly against Russia. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=102.12s)]
*  And then also what Lloyd Austin was just saying there about the anti-personnel mines, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  those have never been given over there, and those are very, very dangerous. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=112.52s)]
*  Once again, that's a major escalation. So if true, this ICBM that was launched for the first time [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  against Ukraine, this would mean a major escalation, really a response to the provocation [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=121.32s)]
*  that the Biden administration is doing in the last three. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  As we got two months going in this administration, President Trump has said that he's going to ramp [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=129.24s)]
*  this war down, and suddenly why are we provoking the Russians and then having a tit for tat? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=133.88s)]
*  Meantime, there's more going on in Iran that we can talk about, but we're on the verge of World War Three [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  in two locations on the Biden-Harris watch, and it's coming in the last two months before President Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=144.76s)]
*  gets in office, and this is outrageous. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=150.44s)]
*  Okay, so also, Vladimir Putin just lowered the threshold for the country to be allowed to use nuclear weapons. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  Their current stance is essentially they could use nuclear weapons if they're attacked at any time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=159.16s)]
*  So where do you think all of this is going? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=165.16s)]
*  Well, once again, we're on the verge of World War Three right now because Putin has said that there [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=167.88s)]
*  was a red line. He said that if we allow Ukraine to attack directly long-range missiles into [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=173.8s)]
*  Russian territory, then that was a red line and that he threatened nuclear action as a result of that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=181.8s)]
*  Look, we also have the Iranians who are one month away from building several nuclear weapons right [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=187.88s)]
*  there, and so this is once again the instability that's brought about through the Biden-Harris [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=192.92s)]
*  weakness. We saw it in Afghanistan. There was a green light for Putin to go two years ago into Russia, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=197.72s)]
*  two and a half years ago now, and so this is something where Russia is right on the edge [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=203.56s)]
*  right now, and this is something that we need President Trump in office right away so that he [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  can ramp down these conflicts and just bring peace to that region. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=213.64s)]
*  So, John, there are also those in the Republican Party who think that President Biden should have [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=217.0s)]
*  already done this, given Ukraine the ability to strike deep inside Russia from day one, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=221.56s)]
*  give them everything they want. You could make the argument that that would be the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=226.2s)]
*  peace through strength position. What about that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=230.2s)]
*  Well, it's not the case because once again this is something where President Putin is ready to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=234.44s)]
*  negotiate because he knows for a long time that this is a position that President Trump has had [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=239.64s)]
*  and that he will, as a dealmaker, he's the art of the deal and he'll be able to push both sides [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=244.36s)]
*  together. But what this risks right now is something that can spiral out of control very [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=248.36s)]
*  quickly. We saw the use, if this is true, the report of the ICBM being used. That's the first [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  time ever, and that shows that all you need to do is put a nuclear warhead on that, and we've got [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=258.04s)]
*  World War III. So this is something that is very dangerous, and if we're looking to strengthen [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=262.2s)]
*  the hand of Zelensky, the Ukrainians, against Russia, this is a very dangerous game to play, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=267.32s)]
*  and we need to be very careful and get President Trump in office so that he can push both sides [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=273.08s)]
*  together and get a deal here. Tense times. John Elliott, thank you so much for joining us. We [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=277.8s)]
*  appreciate it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2sezhsnCPs&t=281.71999999999997s)]
