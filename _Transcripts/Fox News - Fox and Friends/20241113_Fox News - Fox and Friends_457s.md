# Lawrence Jones: There's a reason Washington is 'freaking out' about this Trump pick
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig)
*  All right, Mark Meredith is live in West Palm Beach where the former president lives with the latest on the additions of Trump's transition team mark [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=0.0s)]
*  Lawrence and friends good morning to you the president-elect is expected to get a hero's welcome when he meets with House Republicans a little bit later on today [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=9.0s)]
*  He's expected to show new support for House Speaker Mike Johnson as he gets ready for another likely term as speaker overnight [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Trump also announcing a slew of new people. He would like to serve with come for his administration next year [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=21.94s)]
*  This is video of him getting ready to head to DC from within the last hour Trump getting on his 757 as he makes his way to Washington overnight Trump announcing like Pete Hegseth an army veteran best-selling author and longtime host here on Fox to lead the Department of Defense [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=28.099999999999998s)]
*  Trump writing Pete has spent his entire life as a warrior for the troops and for the country Pete is tough smart and a true believer in America first [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=42.1s)]
*  Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe is Trump's pick for CIA director [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=50.14s)]
*  He'd also previously served in Congress and spoken out frequently about the threat China and Iran pose [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=54.14s)]
*  Trump also calling for Mike Huckabee the former Baptist minister Arkansas governor and TV host to be his ambassador to Israel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=59.14s)]
*  Huckabee says he is honored to serve writing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=66.14s)]
*  It's been an incredible day as Trump asked me to serve as ambassador to Israel a land I've been visiting since 1973 when I was a teenager [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=69.14s)]
*  It will be a privilege to serve my country and my president in this role overnight Trump also making it official [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=77.18s)]
*  He wants South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=83.18s)]
*  Noem says she is both honored and humbled by the opportunity [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=87.18s)]
*  But perhaps the biggest headline today is Trump tapping Elon Musk the owner of Twitter and Tesla [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=91.18s)]
*  I should say X not Twitter these days and Vivek Ramaswamy the former presidential candidate to lead an agency that would be tasked with trying to reshape the federal government itself [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=96.18s)]
*  To cut through bureaucracy to shrink the size of the federal government [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=105.22000000000001s)]
*  There's still a lot of questions about how this exactly would work [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=109.22000000000001s)]
*  But Trump making it clear he wants these two very high profile conservatives to play a key role in the second Trump term [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=112.22000000000001s)]
*  Steve Ainsley, Brian Lawrence back to you guys [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=119.22000000000001s)]
*  And Mark this department that they would head up doge the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=121.22s)]
*  It doesn't exist right now so that presumably somebody would have to hire staff unless Elon Musk uses some of the you know his Tesla geniuses [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=128.26s)]
*  Or some of those guys in the back room to try to do the calculations about where they should make the cuts [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=137.26s)]
*  You know this is interesting some people were kind of saying this is the idea of a deficit reduction committee essentially the ideas here are just some ideas of where government can be reined in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=145.26s)]
*  Now I'm just speculating here I'm not saying this is going to happen but perhaps it's saying to every agency hey Department of Energy where do you see cutbacks are possible [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  They submit a report and then perhaps perhaps it would be Elon and Vivek who then would present that to Trump they could all decide from there [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  But I would imagine that a number of lawmakers would want to exercise their congressional authority before any serious changes [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  Mark remember that when we would see the government waste and it was like t-shirts for certain causes or shrimp on a treadmill [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=177.34s)]
*  That's what this reminds me of pulling back the curtain to see where your tax dollars were [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=184.34s)]
*  Yeah and there was always advocacy groups in DC that would present a report every year of like the biggest waste [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=188.34s)]
*  I mean I think many taxpayers would be outraged if they saw where some of their tax dollars went to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=193.34s)]
*  Of course the federal government is such a huge entity it is not easy for any of us to get our arms around it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=198.34s)]
*  But Trump says there simply has to be changes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=204.34s)]
*  Thank you very much Mark keep in mind going with the pork barrel stuff back in the day [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=206.38s)]
*  That's back when there was a lot of it because you know your congressman would go to Washington DC [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=210.38s)]
*  And then next thing you know they're building a bridge or they're building that shrimp on a treadmill laboratory [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=215.38s)]
*  They would throw all of it in a bill [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=222.38s)]
*  Right and well it was in different bills but they would bring the money back home and then they would be heroes [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=223.38s)]
*  But they've pretty much gotten rid of a lot of that pork and a lot of those earmarks [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=229.38s)]
*  The Simpson bowls these guys gave all three or two years of their lives to study how to make government more efficient [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=233.42s)]
*  And President Obama looked at and said we'll never do this I'll never get congressional approval for this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=238.42s)]
*  So I would look at the Simpson bowls what they came up with see if any of that is usable because they did a lot of the work [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=243.42s)]
*  Paid millions of dollars and of course they don't use it and these were two retired senators at the time [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=248.42s)]
*  But let's talk about the new line up [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=254.42s)]
*  Pete Hagseth came out what time last night around 9 o'clock [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=256.42s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=260.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  645 yeah, yeah was during Laura Ingram show or Sean show yeah, so Pete our friend [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  We're so proud of you Pete if you're watching he's our weekend co-host sits right here on the curvy couch [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=268.58000000000004s)]
*  And he has just been such an advocate of Donald Trump's but more importantly the military it is his life [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=272.58000000000004s)]
*  He loves meeting with veterans every time we go to diners all the veterans say where's Pete house Pete? What's he really like? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=278.58000000000004s)]
*  He's a great guy look at this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  He served our country army National Guard infantry officer served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  Then he was a guard at Gitmo two Bronze Stars combat infantryman badge [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he went to also Princeton and Harvard of course he's been at Fox News for 10 years and he was a CEO of concerned veterans of America [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  a huge pick by the president-elect and if you're wondering why Washington is freaking out about this appointment [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  You know he wrote a book about the corruption [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=314.14s)]
*  That's going on in the Department of Defense all the focus on wokeness as you remember they also [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=316.38s)]
*  Targeted him tried to force him into retirement [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=321.9s)]
*  And so if the Pentagon is not in support of this that there may be a little reason why and and the reason [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=324.62s)]
*  This is a great point Lawrence the fact that he has written a number of New York Times number one best-selling books [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=331.18s)]
*  But his book called war on warriors [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=337.62s)]
*  Essentially and I'm sure Donald Trump either has read the book or [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=341.0s)]
*  Has watched Pete's specials and Donald Trump would go you know what what he's talking about right there is what I would like to do [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=344.64s)]
*  So this is why it you know it makes perfect sense why Pete would get tapped for this particular job [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=351.92s)]
*  Keep an eye on Lee's held in two. I think he's gonna have a real important job to get our energy [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=358.38s)]
*  Together it's gonna allow the drilling natural gas the pipelines back together get the export going over to Europe [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=362.32s)]
*  The other positions that need to be filled Treasury Attorney General interior agriculture commerce labor HHS so [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=368.24s)]
*  transportation energy and education [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=376.36s)]
*  I have no specialty [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=378.72s)]
*  Attorney General is still open yeah also her C&I this morning [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  Cash Patel is on the short list almost there for AG to be at the FBI right so they were saying on him [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=385.36s)]
*  They were suggesting he means Chris Ray would be fired and and cash Patel would be brought in right the story a couple [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  Days ago was the cash Patel might go to the CIA, but mr.. Radcliffe has gone there [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=398.16s)]
*  There's one you left off the the list and that is Marco Rubio [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  You know we think he's gonna be Secretary of State we heard that a couple of days ago here [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=406.1s)]
*  We are on Wednesday. We heard about on Monday [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=410.54s)]
*  Still no official notification that he's been nominated [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  I would say this I thought the same thing and I was communicating with someone very higher up last night said there's no problems [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=416.12s)]
*  It's a go [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=423.74s)]
*  Even senator Fetterman Democrats said his quote was he's a strong choice for you, and he looks forward to working with him [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=426.24s)]
*  That'll work. I bet you he's the mansion of this also very important for Israel Mike Huckabee will be the ambassador Israel [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoZWDR5xMig&t=433.3s)]
