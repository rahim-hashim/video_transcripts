# Kamala Harris demands six-week cease-fire in Gaza
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco)
*  A Fox News alert. Israel boycotting ceasefire negotiations yesterday as Hamas terrorists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=0.0s)]
*  reportedly refused to provide a list of the hostages still alive in captivity. The news [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=5.04s)]
*  coming as top Israel cabinet member Benny Gantz traveled to Washington to meet with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=10.64s)]
*  President Biden's administration members, including VP Harris later today. So what's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=15.52s)]
*  next for Israel? And is this administration trying to divide the Israeli government? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=20.72s)]
*  Joining us now, former IDF spokesperson and senior fellow at the FDD, Jonathan [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=25.84s)]
*  Canriquez. Jonathan, great to see you again. First off, why is Benny Gantz coming here [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  when Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right Likud Party spokesperson said this was an unauthorized visit [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=38.56s)]
*  and Netanyahu reportedly said it's going to be that we can only have one prime minister at a time [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=45.52s)]
*  in a tough conversation you had with Benny Gantz before he left. What's going on here? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=51.36s)]
*  Yeah, good morning. I hope you can hear me well. I'm in southern Israel in Zderot, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=55.76s)]
*  close to the action, close to Gaza. So it's no secret that the strategic ties between Israel and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=62.64s)]
*  the U.S. are of the utmost importance for Israel and for regional stability. And as such, I think [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=69.28s)]
*  all Israeli parties are trying to do the best with the current situation and perhaps most [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  importantly, alleviate pressure from the U.S., which is leveled on Israel, in order to be forced [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=81.04s)]
*  into this deal that is now being spoken about a lot and that Israel really wants to release our [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  hostages. But we find ourselves in a situation where Hamas are making preposterous demands, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=94.64s)]
*  perhaps banking on the fact that they know that there's a lot of pressure on Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=100.72s)]
*  And I think that the visit of Minister Gantz is part of the effort to try to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  alleviate some of that and get a better bargaining position for Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=110.0s)]
*  Do you believe Prime Minister Netanyahu wants him to go or not? Is this spokesperson wrong saying [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=115.12s)]
*  that he did not want him to go? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  I think it serves the eventual purpose of getting Israelis home and that is what [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  eventually matters the most. Politics are important for politicians. What Israelis care [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=130.08s)]
*  about is getting Israelis back home and winning the war. And we've gone too many nights and days [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=135.28s)]
*  and the families are waiting for their loved ones to be returned from the hell that Hamas [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=141.12s)]
*  is keeping them. And in my mind, I think that any means are justified here in order to further the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=146.24s)]
*  chances of us getting them home and winning the war. I don't know why you, why don't you answer [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=153.6s)]
*  the question though, does Netanyahu want Benny Gantz to go? And is this an attempt by this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=159.28s)]
*  administration to defy the Israeli government who clearly have a problem with your Prime Minister? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=165.76s)]
*  I don't know. I honestly don't know what the Prime Minister prefers and what he doesn't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=173.12s)]
*  prefer. But I think that this cabinet is more or less focused on defeating Hamas and trying to get [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=176.96s)]
*  the best conditions possible for getting Israelis home. I think a big challenge that we have ahead [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=182.8s)]
*  of us is the issue of Rafah. There are, that needs to be taken, it needs to be done, but the IDF has [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=188.08s)]
*  been told to wait and wait and wait until the deal is made in order to deliver the final and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=195.84s)]
*  decisive blow against Hamas and in military terms, that is never a good thing when you lose momentum [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  and when you stop in your tracks. I hear you. Here's our Vice President calling on you guys [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  to stop fighting. Watch. I will repeat, the threat of Hamas poses to the people of Israel [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=214.16s)]
*  must be eliminated and given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=223.28s)]
*  ceasefire. For at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=235.36s)]
*  Can you have, can Hamas be defeated if you don't go into Rafah? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=245.68s)]
*  The short answer is no. Hamas cannot and will not be defeated until the IDF takes Rafah, dismantles [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=252.24s)]
*  the tunnels that have been running weapons into Gaza for the last 15, 20 years through Egypt. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=258.56s)]
*  Without those tunnels closed, Hamas has a way out and it has a way to build its future capabilities [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  and trying to argue otherwise would be not telling the truth. We need to win this war. We need to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  defeat Hamas in a decisive way for them and all other terrorists to understand what fate awaits [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=277.44s)]
*  them when you cross the border into Israel, when you massacre 1200 Israelis, mostly civilians, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=284.32s)]
*  they cannot be allowed to live and see the light of another day. The war could end very quickly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=290.8s)]
*  and as the Vice President says, ceasefire can in and is within reach. If Hamas surrenders, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=295.84s)]
*  if they turn over the hostages unconditionally and if the Hamas coward leaders emerge from [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  underground under their hiding underneath Israeli civilians, the war would end, I think, very quickly [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=307.76s)]
*  because Israelis want to get on with living but that isn't the case and the decision here is by [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=313.12s)]
*  Hamas and it is simply no way of ending the war without defeating Hamas and defeating Hamas comes [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=318.24s)]
*  after we take Rafah. Right and all those civilians, every civilian death is a tragedy but it's Hamas [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=324.88s)]
*  is to blame. You guys are dropping fires, text messages, making calls, you're providing corridors [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=331.2s)]
*  to exit. It's up to Hamas to do it but instead they keep people in arms away because they cower [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=336.0s)]
*  in basements of schools and hospitals. Jonathan, thank you so much. Thank you for having me and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=341.84s)]
*  have a good morning. All right, stay safe. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1YHLFjxco&t=347.35999999999996s)]
