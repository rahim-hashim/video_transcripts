# BREAKING: Accused Trump assassin facing new charges
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw)
*  We're going to shift to this Fox News alert and some big news here. The state of Florida is charging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=0.0s)]
*  field Trump assassin suspect Ryan Ruth with attempted first degree murder and terrorism. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=4.72s)]
*  Dana Marie McNichol is live in Miami with the latest for us. Hey Dana Marie. Hey Ainsley, good [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=10.56s)]
*  morning. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeyer says these charges of attempted murder and terrorism [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=15.44s)]
*  are a long time coming. He tells Fox News that the Florida's investigation into Ryan Ruth was [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=20.8s)]
*  delayed more than 200 days because of what he described as stonewalling by the Biden administration. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=27.04s)]
*  Now Uthmeyer says that Florida law enforcement, they had trouble even accessing the crime scene [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=34.16s)]
*  and the Attorney General's office was met with major roadblocks in trying to prosecute this case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=39.84s)]
*  Here's what he told us. We want a justice system that is willing to pursue justice no matter what [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  party is in charge and Joe Biden and the Democrats did everything they could to drag their feet [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=51.76s)]
*  and refuse to cooperate with the state of Florida. Under Attorney General Bondi and the Trump [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  administration and our new FBI director, it's been a breath of fresh air, very different. They've been [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=62.32s)]
*  transparent, cooperative. Uthmeyer says this will be a collaborative investigation. The federal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  government, he says, has made their evidentiary folder available to his office and they plan to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=74.32s)]
*  do the same. He also mentioned that more evidence about the case will become public very shortly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=79.92s)]
*  Now Ruth is already facing a state charge for attempted felony murder related to a traffic [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=86.0s)]
*  accident that injured a six-year-old little girl after he fled the scene at Trump International [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=91.68s)]
*  Golf Club. Now Uthmeyer also confirmed that case is still ongoing and back out here live guys, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=97.28s)]
*  this federal case, the federal charges that Ryan Ruth are facing will take precedent so of course [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=102.64s)]
*  they will have to wait until that trial is over scheduled to start in September until the state [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=108.08s)]
*  of Florida can proceed with their trial. All right, Dan Marie, thank you very much. And you know, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=112.4s)]
*  it was after that attempt at his golf course in West Palm Beach that suddenly the Secret Service [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  changed everything and now he is traveling with, he's armored up wherever he goes and he should be. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=123.84s)]
*  Absolutely. Well I think the bit, also the big takeaway, Angelina, is the fact that this guy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=130.8s)]
*  attacks were grander than he was able to carry out. How that weapon that he was trying to get, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=134.88s)]
*  the communications, I know the feds have that communication, they're probably not wanting to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=140.16s)]
*  release everything that's there yet but following that trail, is there a connection with the first [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  attempt as well? I look forward to hearing what the FBI is going to say about that. Yeah, when you're in Palm Beach, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  they have, they block off that entire street around Mar-a-Lago. There are cement barriers, you have your [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=153.44s)]
*  car sniffed if you're driving into the club, if you're a member of the club or you're expected to go [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  there for dinner and they check everything but they will not even open that. I think it's like [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=164.0s)]
*  if he's not, if he leaves and then he's coming back, 48 hours before he comes back, they put that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=169.92s)]
*  barrier up again. So you have to drive if you're at the southern end of the island on Palm Beach, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=176.08s)]
*  you have to drive over the bridge, get back on the main road on West Palm and then go back on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=179.92s)]
*  the other bridge to get to the northern side of the island. So they're definitely, they've set up [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=185.04s)]
*  this huge perimeter to keep him safe. I remember he was golfing with Steve Witkoff at the time as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=189.12s)]
*  they were about to make the turn when the shots got fired and he was able to find out about it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  and head it off but if you find out, we're finding out more and more about this guy. Obviously, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  deranged profiles like every killer thought it was his responsibility to take out Donald Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=204.72s)]
*  That's what Elon Musk was saying. People make him and that Trump so, they make such villains, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  they feel it's their duty in their twisted minds to do something for the world to stop him from [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=216.16s)]
*  coming to power. That's the danger of this violent rhetoric and I have a sense that if Trump had not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=222.32s)]
*  won, we never would have gotten this detail and these type of stiff charges. I still have a lot [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=230.16s)]
*  of questions against this guy and I still have a ton of questions about Butler. Yep. We all do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkfB0ARJQw&t=235.2s)]
