# Dem candidate mocked after reporter injured at campaign gun event: 'Morons'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA)
*  Democratic Senate candidate Lucas Kuhns is facing backlash after a local TV reporter was struck by a bullet fragment while Kuhns was firing a gun at a gun range during a campaign event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=0.0s)]
*  His opponent, GOP Senator Josh Holley, posted to X, quote, I know the Kuhns campaign needed a shot in the arm, but this is taking it a little far. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=12.0s)]
*  Federalist co-founder Sean Davis also weighed in saying, quote, Absolutely mind-blowing insanity from a candidate for a political party that wants to take away your guns because it claims you can't safely own them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=21.0s)]
*  Kuhns gave this statement to Fox News Digital saying, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=32.0s)]
*  Safety is important to us, which is why the range was set up and run by a certified NRA training counselor. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=35.0s)]
*  We acted quickly and I'm glad the reporter was OK and able to keep reporting. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=42.0s)]
*  And those are your headlines, guys. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=47.0s)]
*  A little bit of controversy over that one. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=49.0s)]
*  These morons had a cameraman downrange as they were shooting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=50.0s)]
*  Anybody that, I mean, Chris, you want to give a hand? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=55.0s)]
*  Anyone that believes in the Second Amendment and understands firearm safety? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=58.0s)]
*  No, you don't have cameramen downrange as they're shooting live rounds. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=63.0s)]
*  No, this I think it was in his backyard, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=67.0s)]
*  They were shooting at the home. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=69.0s)]
*  It was a private home. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=70.0s)]
*  At his home? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=71.0s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=72.0s)]
*  And to the reporter's credit, and that's why there's that great video right there is because there was a TV crew there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=73.0s)]
*  The reporter got bandaged up by the candidate who apparently was a Marine and he had all the stuff there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=80.0s)]
*  And there's Adam Kinzinger. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=86.0s)]
*  Haven't seen him for a while. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=87.0s)]
*  And next thing you know, the reporter kept reporting. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=88.0s)]
*  He finished the story and now he is the story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=91.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=95.0s)]
*  All right. Best of luck. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vj4X7LN_QA&t=96.0s)]
