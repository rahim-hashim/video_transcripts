# This has caught Trump’s attention: Will Cain
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk)
*  Canadian diplomats just met with President-elect Trump's team in Florida to discuss the risk of imposing new trade tariffs and the northern border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=0.0s)]
*  The visit follows Trump offering Canada tax cuts if they agree to become our 51st state. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=10.0s)]
*  Former State Department Senior Advisor under Trump, Christian Witten, joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=15.0s)]
*  Christian, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=20.0s)]
*  It's fun, and I think there's a lot of really deep conversations to be had about American expansion. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=22.0s)]
*  The question is how seriously do we take this idea of Canada becoming the 51st state of America? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=30.0s)]
*  And I think the answer, Christian, is pretty seriously if they're running to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's serious. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=42.0s)]
*  Now, they're running to Mar-a-Lago in panic mode. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=43.0s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, the left-wing prime minister who is probably on his way out, probably will lose office along with his party this year, already went to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=45.0s)]
*  Obviously what he said and offered wasn't sufficient for Trump because Trump has been sort of having fun, I think, on Truth Social, on Twitter with this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=54.0s)]
*  You know, it's not a bad idea if you take the central provinces, if you take Alberta, Saskatchewan, parts of Manitoba, and if you take British Columbia, excluding Vancouver, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=63.0s)]
*  which is very left-wing, those states make a lot of sense and would be a natural part of the United States and a link with Alaska, maybe with Greenland. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=73.0s)]
*  If you take all of Canada, you're going to get a lot of lefties, a lot of socialists, some French speakers, and you're going to make America harder to govern or more liberal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=81.0s)]
*  So, you know, I don't think it's a terrible idea, and I think a lot of those central provinces might like to be governed by Washington or at least have more self-governance rather than the pinkos in Ottawa who are unpopular. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=90.0s)]
*  I think that's such a great point, Christian, and it's one that needs to be highlighted. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=101.0s)]
*  It actually ties into this culture debate that's been raging with Vivek and Elon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=105.0s)]
*  You don't just absorb a new country unless they can be absorbed into your culture. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=109.0s)]
*  That's a bottom-line truism, and maybe parts of Canada can. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=113.0s)]
*  By the way, Jean-Sebastien Camot, spokesman for Canada's new finance minister Dominic LeBlanc, said, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=117.0s)]
*  Minister LeBlanc and Minister Jolie had a positive productive meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Howard Lutnick and Doug Burgum as a follow-up to the dinner between the prime minister and President Trump last month. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=123.0s)]
*  I want to also transition this. If we're going to talk about American expansion, I actually love the instincts by Trump, Greenland, Canada, Panama, if it makes sense for the United States. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=134.0s)]
*  Can you talk to me about the Panama Canal? What is it about China and the role they're playing at the Panama Canal that has Trump's attention? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=145.0s)]
*  Two things about the canal. One is Chinese companies like Hutchison Wapua, which is Hong Kong-based. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=154.0s)]
*  As you know, Hong Kong is just another Chinese city now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=161.0s)]
*  Beijing extinguished press freedom there through people like Jimmy Lai into prison who owned a pro-democracy paper. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=165.0s)]
*  So you have, anyway, these Chinese companies that basically operate the ports of the canal that we built at great expense and a great cost of life. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=172.0s)]
*  Lots of people died of malaria. That's sort of the concern. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=180.0s)]
*  Number one, China also owning a port now, a super port in Peru. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=184.0s)]
*  So it's extending its tentacles into our into our southern hemisphere. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=188.0s)]
*  And then also basically Panama is charging tariffs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=194.0s)]
*  They're non-tariff barriers to trade, but exorbitant fees for ships to transit the Panama Canal, US ships, whether it's the military or ships carrying commercial goods. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=198.0s)]
*  Sometimes these fees can go as high as $400,000 during ordinary times. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=208.0s)]
*  And then extraordinary times, they can go up to $4 million. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=213.0s)]
*  So these are things that have to be corrected in Trump's view. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=216.0s)]
*  OK, one last quick question for you, Christian. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=219.0s)]
*  I'm tight with 30 seconds, but I know you can answer it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=221.0s)]
*  What does Greenland offer to the United States? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=224.0s)]
*  If that were a serious piece of American expansion, what would we get out of Greenland? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=226.0s)]
*  Well, they would get something and we would get something as climate changes, I believe naturally. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=232.0s)]
*  It's easier to exploit natural resources in Canada, and especially if you have US capital and the resources there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=237.0s)]
*  Greenlanders who are ruled by Denmark really mad at their high cost of living. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=245.0s)]
*  We can help make them rich. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=249.0s)]
*  If they had an Alaska style trust fund where they get revenue instead of the government from natural resource extraction, they could all be millionaires. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=251.0s)]
*  So they would be better off and we would be better off. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=258.0s)]
*  All right, good stuff. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=261.0s)]
*  Fascinating discussion that I think too many people are dismissing as crazy talk. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=262.0s)]
*  You know, crazy talk used to be what drove the world forward, Christian. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=265.0s)]
*  So I appreciate the instinct from Donald Trump and your enlightenment this morning. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=270.0s)]
*  Christian Witten, thanks a lot. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=275.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=276.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDDhMVXPvk&t=277.0s)]
