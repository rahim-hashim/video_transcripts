# 'LIBERATION DAY': Trump set to unveil major economic shake-up
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI)
*  All right, so President Trump is set to roll out a wave of tariffs to advance his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=0.0s)]
*  America First economic agenda. It's an event that he is calling Liberation Day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=4.32s)]
*  What is Jackie Heinrich calling it? Jackie, what are you calling it? A lot, a lot to handle. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=9.64s)]
*  I'm trying to wrap my head around what's coming. We don't have all the details right now, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=15.56s)]
*  and so we're really awaiting, just like everybody else, the full news on what this will look like. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=20.6s)]
*  But the White House has said it's already seen evidence that this strategy is going to work, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=24.64s)]
*  including from billions of dollars of private investment coming back into the country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=29.84s)]
*  They're telling anyone that's been spooked by what they've seen with the jitteriness in the stock [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=34.4s)]
*  market that this policy is ultimately going to return production to America, generate more [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=38.72s)]
*  American jobs and also more tax revenue. And the president says ultimately Wall Street's going to be just fine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  They will be effective immediately. And the president has been teasing this for quite some [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=51.44s)]
*  time as they're not going to be wrong. It is going to work. And the president has a brilliant [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=55.84s)]
*  team of advisors who have been studying these issues for decades. And we are focused on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=60.24s)]
*  restoring the golden age of America and making America a manufacturing superpower. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=66.16s)]
*  There are several unknowns, including how the White House plans to structure this. The White [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=71.12s)]
*  House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Fox News Sunday the tariffs could raise $600 billion annually, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=75.76s)]
*  which some took to imply an average rate of 20 percent. According to some reports, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=81.36s)]
*  the president has considered a flat 20 percent as a way to generate more revenue to offset the tax [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=86.48s)]
*  cuts he hopes to push through Congress. But Moody's chief economist said yesterday a 20 percent [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=92.08s)]
*  universal tariff would be a worst case scenario combined with full retaliation from other countries [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=97.04s)]
*  on U.S. goods. Moody's claiming its simulation with those inputs would wipe out five and a half [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=101.92s)]
*  million jobs, raise unemployment to seven percent, and drop GDP by 1.7 percent. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=107.2s)]
*  But the president's allies say it is not going to come to that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  You have to trust the president's instincts on the economy. OK, why? You don't. This isn't blind [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=116.48s)]
*  faith. Remember what he accomplished in the first administration. Everybody's a little concerned. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=121.92s)]
*  We all are. But at the end of the day, we got to have faith in our leadership. Our country's going [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=127.04s)]
*  in the wrong direction. Thirty seven three and in debt. We've got to get manufacturing back to the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=133.04s)]
*  country, people back to work. Better way to do that is tariff. So let's give it a shot and see [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  what happens. Now, President Trump said he might not fully equalize tariff rates with some countries [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=143.28s)]
*  because their rates are so high he would be, quote, embarrassed to charge them the same rate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  There will also be some kind of new charge applied to new countries as well as sector specific [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=154.56s)]
*  tariffs. Steel and aluminum imports are already subject to a 25 percent tariff and 25 percent [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=160.64s)]
*  tariffs will also be applied to auto imports starting tomorrow. That does include auto parts. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=165.76s)]
*  The administration, though, has welcomed deals from other countries to try to offset some of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=170.48s)]
*  this. The UK, for instance, is trying to shape an agreement on artificial intelligence. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=175.44s)]
*  On the other hand, though, we just saw yesterday the prime minister in Canada and Mexico's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  president come together on a phone call to try to come up with some kind of a deal to bolster their [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  trade and blunt the impact coming from the U.S. So we'll see what comes out of the 4 o'clock [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=189.6s)]
*  Rose Garden press conference, guys. That's right. And, you know, Jackie, I was just thinking about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=194.64s)]
*  that. The president's calling it Liberation Day, but maybe we should call it Libation Day because, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=198.64s)]
*  you know, Wall Street's all over the place. They might start hitting the sauce at 4 o'clock when [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  they finally unveil this thing. Maybe even sooner. That's right. I was reading this morning that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  according to the Wall Street Journal, some people in the business community and on Wall Street are [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=216.08s)]
*  still banking on the idea that the White House might actually pull back on the tariffs if [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=221.68s)]
*  something bad happens to the economy. And I know Goldman Sachs is predicting now with the tariffs, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=227.28s)]
*  there's a 35 percent chance of a recession. That has been put out there. I think also the impact [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  of a recession on other countries would be more difficult. For instance, with Canada, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=241.76s)]
*  it would be harder for them to pull out of a recession, which is a big concern for them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=246.64s)]
*  But to your earlier point, you know, we have seen the president's willingness to either delay some [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  of these tariffs when he gets a reaction from companies that would be impacted by them or when [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=257.28s)]
*  he gets outreach from other countries, willingness to come together on some of these trade [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=261.76s)]
*  agreements and sort of reshuffle the groundwork of what it is we're sort of building off of. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=266.0s)]
*  So we haven't heard a lot of proposals from the rest of the world on what exactly it is that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=271.2s)]
*  they're trying to offer the president to offset this. He might get into some of those details [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=277.2s)]
*  today. But I think the real issue that Wall Street is looking at is just the uncertainty [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  here because we don't know so much. And if he decides to put in place a universal tariff, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=287.84s)]
*  whether it's a 20 percent or something less, and what that means versus taking sort of a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=293.28s)]
*  piecemeal approach and dealing with individual countries, that will have different kinds of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=298.08s)]
*  impacts on the economy. And that's the reason that investors are worried, guys. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=303.2s)]
*  Okay. Thank you so much, Jackie. It's all about Light Nation Day. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=307.68s)]
*  Trump just doesn't want to be taken advantage of. And he says, not on my watch. If everything's got [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=310.4s)]
*  to be equal, this is reciprocal. And this is going to be great news coming down at four o'clock for [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=315.12s)]
*  your interview tomorrow. You're talking to JD Vance in Washington. Yeah, tomorrow we'll be doing [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=320.24s)]
*  the show. You guys will be on the couch. I'll be at the White House. And we're going to ask the vice [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=324.08s)]
*  president about this. He's been a great messenger for the president. And I think this is where the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=329.12s)]
*  Republican Party and the populace kind of start to split apart. And this is how you got that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=334.0s)]
*  Democratic coalition that switched over from the Democrats to the Republican side. All those union [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=339.52s)]
*  workers, they support this. Right. This is their job. Yeah. What Ro Khanna was saying that really [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=344.88s)]
*  helped his district with the steel tariffs last time. Now there's going to be all imports on steel, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=349.52s)]
*  25 percent aluminum, 25 auto imports expected to start today too. They expect reciprocal tariffs [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  just on the money. If nobody changes what they're doing and what they're taxing us, $600 billion. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=360.0s)]
*  But Moody's comes out and they said that an escalation in the trade war could wipe out 5.5 [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  million jobs and lift unemployment to 7 percent and GDP could drop 1.7 percent. That's if people [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=370.24s)]
*  don't come off it and Moody's is not for it. But the tariffs will apply. It will bring a lot of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=377.12s)]
*  money in on just the tariff goods. And let's see. The ultimate goal is to bring manufacturing back [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=382.24s)]
*  here. Right. Ro Khanna doesn't think it's going to bring manufacturing back. Well, Brian, that is [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=388.08s)]
*  the dream. Keep in mind, this is a gigantic experiment like we've never seen before. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=392.0s)]
*  You know, on paper, it looks great to the president and his team who are talking about it would be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=396.72s)]
*  great to bring jobs back to the United States. But keep in mind, people have got to come over [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=401.84s)]
*  here and build factories and that takes years. And there's a lot of uncertainty on Wall Street [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  and also in the business community about, okay, this new round of tariffs, how long is it going [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=413.28s)]
*  to last? Are they going to last one year, five years, 10 years? They've got to be able to plan. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's why the stock market has been all over the place. Well, the reciprocal tariffs can end [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  today if they just remove them off our country as well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st5KJ-iy-fI&t=427.92s)]
