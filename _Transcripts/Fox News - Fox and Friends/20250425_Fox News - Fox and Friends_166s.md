# Ex-judge, wife arrested for reportedly harboring alleged Tren de Aragua gang member
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw)
*  All right, federal officials arresting a recently resigned New Mexico judge and his wife for allegedly harboring a suspected Trinidad, Aragua gang member. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=0.0s)]
*  Chandley Painter is here with the details. Hey, Chandley. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=9.52s)]
*  Hey, good morning. So the former judge, Joel Cannell, and his wife, Nancy, each face charges of evidence tampering for allegedly harboring this man, Cristian Ortega Lopez, an illegal immigrant and alleged Trinidad, Aragua gang member. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=12.32s)]
*  Despite the couple's arrest this week, the controversy began in late February when Homeland Security Investigations arrested three Venezuelan nationals, including Ortega Lopez, during a raid on the judge's property in New Mexico. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=26.4s)]
*  Cannell then resigned as a magistrate judge in March, and earlier this week, though, the Supreme Court of New Mexico permanently banned him from ever serving as a judge again. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=39.24s)]
*  And just as a reminder that when you have four years of an administration in the Democrat Party completely embracing open borders, this is going to haunt them for years, if not decades, because it doesn't matter. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=110.04s)]
*  These stories are going to keep coming out. They're never going to go away. They're never going to get over it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=125.04s)]
*  And if Republicans are smart, they will forever remind voters that this is what Democrats embraced, bringing in literally millions of illegals, many of them gang bangers, who committed crimes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=130.04s)]
*  You know what the worst is, Charlie? They denied it. And then they told you they couldn't be stopped. It's a policy issue. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=143.04s)]
*  You needed new laws. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=149.04s)]
*  Don't believe your eyes. Don't believe the Border Patrol. But that makes it worse. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WxZwIT5Cyw&t=151.04s)]
