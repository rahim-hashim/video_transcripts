# EXCLUSIVE: Florida Highway Patrol bust migrants using new law
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw)
*  Fox News is getting exclusive ride along of a migrant bust in Tampa. Dana Marie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=0.0s)]
*  McNichol joins us now from the Sunshine State. Hey, Dana Marie. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=5.84s)]
*  Hi, good morning, guys. Well, immigration enforcement on the road is new for the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  state of Florida. They're taking a directive from President Trump. So we [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  spent the morning with FHP as their operation took a dangerous turn. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=18.02s)]
*  We got 100 across northbound, northbound. A man ran from the Florida Highway [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=24.1s)]
*  Patrol after being pulled over for a traffic violation. When his legal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=28.78s)]
*  status was questioned, he took off. Come on out here right now. I see your [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=34.74s)]
*  hands. Come on out. He was caught hiding in a nearby neighborhood shed. He was [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  previously convicted for unlawful possession of a firearm and assaulting [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=43.54s)]
*  an officer, according to Border Patrol. For the first time, Florida troopers [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  have the ability to question a person's immigration status on the side of the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=52.3s)]
*  road. That wasn't always the case. Every day, Florida Highway Patrol troopers [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=56.58s)]
*  would interact with people that were most likely here unlawfully, and there [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  was nothing that we could do as state law enforcement officers. Now FHP is the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=63.82s)]
*  only state agency in the nation trained and acting in partnership with federal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  immigration agents under what is known as the 287 G agreement. And Fox News is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=72.78s)]
*  the first to see it in action. The van and trailer was originally pulled over [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=78.62s)]
*  for speeding, but Florida Highway Patrol officers say all 11 passengers [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=82.46s)]
*  are undocumented and now being detained before the sun was even up. Troopers [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=86.61999999999999s)]
*  had a total of 30 people in custody. That's just here on a small stretch of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=93.02s)]
*  highways in Hillsborough County, Tampa, Florida. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=98.08s)]
*  Although the operation could have lasted much longer, FHP FHP said it was [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=102.88s)]
*  over within an hour because they were at capacity. They didn't have any more [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=107.02s)]
*  room to hold undocumented migrants. So guys, this begs the question about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  detention space not only here in Florida, but nationwide. But Dan Marie, I [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=115.14s)]
*  mean, how great is that sometimes going right along to nothing happens and you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=119.3s)]
*  get exactly what they were looking for. It was a wild morning, guys. Let me [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=123.86s)]
*  tell you, watching them all jump into action, but we were happy to be able to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=130.26s)]
*  bring it to you this morning. What happened? What happens if you said [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=134.38s)]
*  everyone in that van was illegal? They're detained. What happens next? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=137.5s)]
*  Yeah, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=141.26s)]
*  so then if they have final removal orders, they will be processed to be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=142.46s)]
*  deported. And then if not, they will go through to process the immigration [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=146.46s)]
*  judge and then the process goes from there. So again, it's a lot about, yes, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=150.06s)]
*  the mission is to find undocumented migrants, but then to keep them and have [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=154.68s)]
*  capacity space. That's the next step. And I know Governor Ron DeSantis has [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=159.66s)]
*  sent a plan to DHS to expand that in the state, and they're just waiting on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=163.18s)]
*  some approvals. Did they have a heads up or like, did the police have a heads [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=166.98s)]
*  up or were they just pulling people over like the van? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=171.74s)]
*  So this was a Florida Highway Patrol criminal interdiction unit. So we went [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=176.78s)]
*  out in the morning and they were pulled over for normal traffic violations. So [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=180.92s)]
*  the van that I showed you there, they were going over 80 miles per hour. So [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=185.28s)]
*  when the trooper approached the van, they talked to those inside and that's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=189.66s)]
*  when they found out their immigration status. Wow. Thanks, Henry. Thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=193.26s)]
*  So you got a guy with weapons charge that's running through traffic. Uh, and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  then he goes and hides in a garage. That could have been a terrible situation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=201.82s)]
*  You don't know what the guy has on him. He's running for a reason because he [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=205.94s)]
*  knows that he's gonna be deported. Every single state should be working with [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=208.7s)]
*  federal and law enforcement to get these people out of these are people that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=214.06s)]
*  already have criminal records. Uh, so they already committed crimes. The [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=217.22s)]
*  first crime was coming to the country illegally. Then they came here, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=220.8s)]
*  committed more crimes. They gotta go. Right. So there's nothing about it. The [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  illegal immigration that went into the sanctuary cities was by the tens of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=227.4s)]
*  thousands. Thanks to Joe Biden. And now when the price tag comes in, it costs [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=230.82000000000002s)]
*  New York. They estimate over the last few years $7 billion to house them, to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=234.96s)]
*  feed them. And it turns out thousands of which have criminal records coming in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=239.46s)]
*  and committed crimes once they got here. So it's just outrageous what's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=244.08s)]
*  happening and nothing's happening with these major cities to change their [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=248.26s)]
*  policy. Well, like in Illinois, Tom Homan was on our show earlier, slamming [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=251.38s)]
*  the governor there Pritzker for ignoring migrant crime and pushing these [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=255.26s)]
*  sanctuary cities. Listen, it continues alive on sanctuary city status in the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=259.8s)]
*  state and Chicago, especially look when the first places I went to after [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=265.9s)]
*  President Trump took the oath of office with Chicago and the first day we [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=270.53999999999996s)]
*  TDA members. We arrested two illegal aliens that were convicted of murder [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=276.02s)]
*  that were walking the streets. We arrested, I think, or six or seven child [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=280.5s)]
*  predators, child rapists in Chicago. And these people are walking the street [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=284.34s)]
*  because Cook County, Cook County jail, one of the biggest jails in the nation [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=288.78s)]
*  won't accept ice. He turned them won't work with ice. I just don't understand [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=292.34s)]
*  what the constituency is of supporting this. You see the poll and even a lot of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=296.06s)]
*  Democrats support getting rid of the criminals out of this country, but you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=301.82s)]
*  still see all these lefties that are advocating for the criminals. It makes [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  no sense. Right. The mayor who's got 18% approval rating, he says they're one [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=309.34s)]
*  of his and that governor is going to run for president Pritzker. It's and he's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  going to run on sanctuary cities. So the American people, he's not going to hide [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=318.02s)]
*  his leniency. So the American people have another choice. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Go3OcUXfw&t=321.98s)]
