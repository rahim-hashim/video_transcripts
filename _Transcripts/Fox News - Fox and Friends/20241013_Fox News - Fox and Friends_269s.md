*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=11.0s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=13.1s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=14.76s)]
*  To become better men. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=16.04s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=17.72s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=19.64s)]
*  Louisiana pastor and famed football coach [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=20.48s)]
*  at Evangelical Christian Academy, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=22.64s)]
*  Denny Duren leads his talented team [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=24.96s)]
*  with a focus on faith. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=27.28s)]
*  Their quest for a 15th state championship [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=29.68s)]
*  is highlighted in the must see series, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=31.72s)]
*  God, Faith and Family, out now on Fox Nation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=34.36s)]
*  Here with more, and in person, coach Denny Duren, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=38.92s)]

*  and junior linebacker and running back, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=44.4s)]
*  Damari Dede Drake. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Gentlemen all, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=49.22s)]
*  Oh, we love being here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=50.8s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=51.72s)]
*  I can't wait to watch this series. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=52.56s)]
*  As a head coach, you take this approach [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  of God, family, football. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=56.56s)]
*  Why do you put it properly ordered that way? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=58.8s)]
*  Well, that is the name that our great producer [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  gave to our program. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  But the fact is, we wouldn't be doing football [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=68.2s)]
*  if I didn't have an opportunity to share Christ [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=71.72s)]
*  with these young men. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=74.12s)]
*  Our program has always been an effort to lift the city. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=75.92s)]
*  And you lift the city one life at a time. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  And we have this wonderful opportunity [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=82.16s)]
*  to get the 75 young men every morning [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=84.38s)]
*  and to share the love of Christ with them [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  and to show them what the gospel can do [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  to elevate their lives. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=92.8s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  And Fabian, you've got a pretty good football team too. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=94.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's pretty good. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=97.55999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you guys are in the running. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  As we watch this season, you will be watching a team [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=100.28s)]
*  in pursuit, potentially, of a state championship. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  You're a good football team. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=106.24s)]
*  Yeah, pretty physical. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=107.06s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  So I get to build the muscles, right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  So we get in the weight room, hard iron. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  We run hard, run fast. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=113.44s)]
*  But most importantly, these guys get [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=114.72s)]
*  to understand that all this is preparing you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=116.8s)]
*  to become a better man. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=118.56s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=120.86s)]
*  Diddy, what's that like? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=122.24s)]
*  What's it like to be in that locker room? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=123.12s)]
*  First of all, I mean, talk about the faith aspect. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=124.44s)]
*  That's different than 99% of how most kids grow up [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=126.44s)]
*  playing high school football. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=130.2s)]
*  First, speak to that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=131.28s)]
*  What does that mean to you? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=132.12s)]
*  It actually means a lot to me [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=134.88s)]
*  because before I even heard of evangel [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=136.4s)]
*  or came to evangel, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=140.0s)]
*  my faith with God wasn't even as strong as it is now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=142.84s)]
*  But now that I'm here, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=146.12s)]
*  football is just a plus. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=147.8s)]
*  But now that I'm here actually going through Bible study, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=149.96s)]
*  being and having great men in my life, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=152.96s)]
*  good mentors, good father figures, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=155.16s)]
*  it just makes my life more easier and better. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=157.52s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=159.88s)]
*  How do you manage playing football with cameras in your face? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=160.82s)]
*  Because you're living a reality show too. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  I just play football, man. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  I just can't worry about the distractions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  Just got to stay on, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=170.16s)]
*  just got to stay with some ton of vision. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=171.84s)]
*  I get that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=173.36s)]
*  And Coach, you feel pretty comfortable. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  You're a minister as well, have been for a long time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  So this is an extension of ministry for you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=180.68s)]
*  And we were so surprised by it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=181.72s)]
*  because we never set out to do this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=184.16s)]
*  There was a young man who was 14 years old when I met him [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  and he got into production. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  And he would come by and say to me [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=192.12s)]
*  whenever we got a chance to be together, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  you know, I'm coming to do your story one day. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=196.6s)]
*  And I said, I don't know what story that would be. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=198.76s)]
*  He said, well, with this football team. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=200.84s)]
*  So he called me four years ago and he said, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=202.88s)]
*  how's the team doing? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=205.04s)]
*  I said, well, we haven't won a game. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=205.88s)]
*  So we're all freshmen and we're 28 strong. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=208.04s)]
*  We only have 28 kids. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=211.04s)]
*  We lost two graduating classes of 68 players. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=212.16s)]
*  Seven of those guys are in the NFL today. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=215.88s)]
*  So they were good players and then there's nothing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=218.32s)]
*  So it was a restart. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  So I said, well, I'm going to get back in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=223.28s)]
*  He said, what are you going to do about it? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=224.88s)]
*  I said, I'm coming out of retirement. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=226.04s)]
*  He said, when? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=227.56s)]
*  I said, tomorrow. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=228.6s)]
*  He said, that's the story I want to do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=229.44s)]
*  And so the rest is history. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=231.44s)]
*  So Aaron Binward is the guy that's behind this, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=233.2s)]
*  this whole story and idea. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=237.44s)]
*  And that's the reason we're doing it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=239.64s)]
*  Taking us under the curtain for sure. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, I look forward to watching. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=243.56s)]
*  I appreciate you being here in New York. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=244.92s)]
*  Danny, Fabian and Day-Day, good luck. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjUiB_G53w&t=246.32s)]
