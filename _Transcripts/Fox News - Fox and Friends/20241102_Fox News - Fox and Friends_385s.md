# 'Backlash' to Mark Cuban remarks was 'epic,' says Trump camp
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E)
*  Former President Trump joined us earlier while on his way to launch his final campaign blitz, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=0.0s)]
*  making stops later today in North Carolina and Virginia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=5.44s)]
*  Will wants to know why so much North Carolina. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=10.0s)]
*  Well, joining us now is the Trump 2024 National Press Secretary, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=12.4s)]
*  Caroline Levin. So she can answer that question. Good morning, Caroline. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=15.76s)]
*  Hey, good morning. Good to see you guys. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=20.56s)]
*  We have it up on the wall. I think we can shoot this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=22.48s)]
*  Where both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump planned to spend the last three days here [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=25.2s)]
*  before the election and the audience can see the different states and cities where they're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=29.2s)]
*  going to be visiting. I did notice Caroline a lot all three days, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=34.0s)]
*  at least a portion of the day in North Carolina. A lot of focus for you guys on North Carolina. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=40.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, President Trump is holding 10 rallies in the next three days, barnstorming [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=48.08s)]
*  the country. It's been more than 70 days and he has not taken a single day off and that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=53.52s)]
*  certainly isn't going to change over the next three. The Tar Heel State is a critical to the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  path to victory. It's where confident President Trump is going to win it for the third time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  And if you look at the early voting trends in North Carolina, Republicans are leading. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  Same goes for Arizona and Georgia. Republicans are doing 20 points better this year with early [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=73.04s)]
*  voting than we did in 2020. So all of the data is showing a big victory on Tuesday night. We [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=78.96s)]
*  are cautiously optimistic, but obviously not taking a single voter for granted. We're focused [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=84.72s)]
*  on encouraging everyone to get out and to vote early for President Trump. Our closing message [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  in this race is very simple. Kamala Harris broke it. President Trump is going to fix it. And it's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=95.35999999999999s)]
*  a stark contrast to the very negative and vitriolic closing message that we're hearing from the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  opposing campaign. Yeah, no doubt about it. Garbage and all kinds of stuff coming from the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=106.16s)]
*  other side about those voting for Donald Trump. I want to talk about strategy because you're [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=111.44s)]
*  hearing a lot of people, maybe it's Nikki Haley. There are others saying it. Donald Trump needs to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  speak more to women, but it's very clear if you look at this campaign that Donald Trump believes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=120.64s)]
*  there's a lot of men out there who agree with his policies, who also feel, I would say, upset about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=124.72s)]
*  all the attacks on men, calling them toxic, all the things that make it harder to be a man, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=134.08s)]
*  including putting food on the table these days, that he's clearly going after the male vote. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=140.24s)]
*  Can you talk to us about that strategy? Because there seems to be a lot of debate about what he [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=145.68s)]
*  should be doing and who he should be talking to. Well, certainly there is a big gender gap in this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  election and it's a problem for the Harris campaign when it comes to men. President Trump [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  is leading Kamala Harris with men in this country by more than 20 points, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=161.36s)]
*  but I would reject the premise that President Trump is not speaking to women at all. He talks [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  to them every single day when he is out on the campaign trail because all issues are women's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=169.36s)]
*  issues. Women in this country want prosperity for our children. We want more money in our pockets. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=174.24s)]
*  President Trump is offering to do that with more tax cuts and to end inflation. Women want safety [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  and security. And what has happened in Kamala Harris's America over the past four years is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  every woman's worst nightmare to have illegal immigrant criminals, rapists and murderers coming [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=189.12s)]
*  over our border, taking the lives of innocent women who Kamala Harris has never even called, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=193.76s)]
*  by the way. President Trump is going to protect women and our families. He's going to restore [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  law and order in this country and he's going to put more money in our pocketbooks. That's an [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=203.04s)]
*  appealing message to women. And again, all of the data we see right now is very encouraging with [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=206.56s)]
*  both genders. Well, Caroline, we had President Trump on the program earlier talking about that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=210.72s)]
*  very subject. Here he is. Well, I know Mark very well. He's a very insecure guy. Can't hit a golf [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=216.08s)]
*  ball more than 50 yards. He's weak physically and mentally, as far as I'm concerned. But I've known [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=224.08s)]
*  him for a long time. You know, he's totally retracted his statement. Like, you know, weak [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=228.72000000000003s)]
*  people always do. They retract their statements. But he was hit by some of the strongest, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=232.4s)]
*  not human beings, women. He was hit by the strongest people that it wasn't men, women. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=238.4s)]
*  It was women. He was hit by women that make men look like babies. Because you know many of the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=245.36s)]
*  women that I deal with and that I have, and I could go over the list, but the list is long, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=253.52s)]
*  including the fact that I happened to be married to a rather strong woman who just right now is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=259.44s)]
*  the number one bestseller in the whole wide world in her book, Melania. So no, I've surrounded myself [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=264.24s)]
*  with women. I've given women chances too. I mean, I had Kellyanne as the head of my 2016 big victory. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=271.52s)]
*  So you take that, the comments that Mark Cuban made, and you add them to that Julia Roberts ad [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=280.0s)]
*  where she's saying, oh, hide your vote from your husband. There's almost this cartoonish view of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=284.4s)]
*  who conservative women are, who all women are, which creates an opportunity for you in the campaign. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=288.96s)]
*  Well, what does the Democrat Party offer women? They think the only issue women care about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=296.56s)]
*  is abortion, which I personally think is incredibly insulting. Again, women care about having money in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=301.2s)]
*  our pockets. We care about border security and safety in our neighborhoods, and we don't want to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=306.88s)]
*  be in a World War III where we're going to have to see our children go off to fight in foreign [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=311.76s)]
*  conflicts. President Trump is offering peace and security and prosperity, and that's a very appealing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=316.56s)]
*  message to women. And Mark Cuban, he certainly learned not to mess with strong, intelligent women [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=321.12s)]
*  who support President Trump. The backlash was epic, and I'm still waiting on Kamala Harris to go to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  a microphone and condemn her top surrogate, Mark Cuban, for those disgusting and insulting comments [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=331.12s)]
*  to not just the women on President Trump's campaign and all those of us who work for him, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=336.8s)]
*  but the tens of millions of women who are proud to cast their ballots for him in this election. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=340.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, let's talk about strong women. She had a baby while she was on this campaign. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=346.24s)]
*  Mark Cuban taking a direct shot at you, Caroline. Absolutely. Your son, three months old? Three [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=351.2s)]
*  months? Three weeks. Three months. Three months. Beautiful baby. And running a campaign. Caroline, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=357.12s)]
*  thanks for being with us on Fox News. Thank you, Caroline. How dare Mark say that? She was like [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=363.2s)]
*  the perfect person to have. Like, this is a woman who just had a baby in the middle of the campaigns, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=367.04s)]
*  killing it, and then here we go. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Erhart. And [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d6PPCxKT4E&t=372.16s)]
