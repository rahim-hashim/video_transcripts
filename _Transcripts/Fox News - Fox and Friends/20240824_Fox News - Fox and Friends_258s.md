# This is the ‘sleeper issue’ of 2024 campaign: Calley Means
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM)
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suspended his campaign and endorsed President Trump, the two taking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=0.0s)]
*  the stage last night and coming together on a range of issues, including making America [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=9.48s)]
*  healthy again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=15.52s)]
*  Our next guest is credited with connecting R.F.K. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=16.92s)]
*  Jr. and Trump on the issue of America's health crisis. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=19.72s)]
*  The co-founder of TrueMed and author of the bestselling book, Good Energy, Callie Means, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=23.72s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=29.96s)]
*  Callie, good morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=31.52s)]
*  It was a remarkable night last night. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=33.88s)]
*  Twitter is blowing up a lot of Democrats, very angry at what's happening, obviously. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=36.56s)]
*  But talk to me about what you think this partnership, this endorsement, will actually mean for this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=42.56s)]
*  idea of making America healthy again. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=48.96s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you've been saying it for over a year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=52.08s)]
*  The childhood chronic disease epidemic is the sleeper issue of this campaign. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=55.86s)]
*  And last night, the forgotten child was thrust squarely into the national conversation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=60.58s)]
*  And from my small vantage point, I can tell you that these two men bonded over questions [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=66.26s)]
*  about what's happening to American's children. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=71.98s)]
*  Why are 50% of American teens overweight or obese when it's only 3% in Japan? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=75.44s)]
*  Why is the American Academy of Pediatrics pushing Ozempic on six-year-olds instead [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=81.94s)]
*  of healthy food? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=85.44s)]
*  Why have autism rates gone up, orders of magnitude in the past 20 years without change in screenings? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  Why have cancer rates been exploding among kids? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  Why does America have the earliest puberty rate among children among any country in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=95.08s)]
*  world because of our inter-disrupting foods that are in our food supply and our environment? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=100.48s)]
*  These questions are at the core, I think, of what's been propelling RFK, what's been [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=106.12s)]
*  propelling Trump, what really is the defining political issue in the country, which is this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=110.0s)]
*  populist frustration with our institutions and the institutions that profit from sick [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=114.1s)]
*  kids are on notice right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=118.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=120.22s)]
*  You know, last night when RFK took the stage, he actually named names. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=121.22s)]
*  He said the USDA, the FDA, the NIH. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=125.42s)]
*  It felt like a declaration of war on government corruption, this collusion, these inside deals [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  that, as you say, are really hurting our children. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=137.12s)]
*  So talk to me about what could happen in a Trump administration. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=140.38s)]
*  Obviously, you know, it was laid out there last night to bear. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=144.06s)]
*  You've been advising both Trump and RFK on these issues because of your deep knowledge [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=148.78s)]
*  on this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=153.5s)]
*  What can we do to stop what we see happening to our kids and to our metabolic health as [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=154.62s)]
*  a nation? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=160.94s)]
*  There are so many things, Rachel, that can happen day one with the president who has [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=161.94s)]
*  moral clarity and courage. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=167.62s)]
*  It starts with just getting corruption out of those institutions that you named. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=170.42s)]
*  Americans would be shocked to learn that 95% of the USDA panel that recommends nutrition [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=175.1s)]
*  guidelines for kids are paid for by food companies or pharma companies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=179.22s)]
*  We can get unbiased doctors like Mark Hyman, Peter Tia, others on the USDA nutrition panel [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  to actually have guidelines that make sense to say that there's a metabolic health crisis [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  among kids and stop recommending sugar to two year olds, which is what currently happens. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=192.22s)]
*  People should be shocked to learn that 80% of NIH grants right now go to professors with [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=197.14s)]
*  conflict of interest. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  With one stroke of a pen, a president could say no more conflicts of interest in NIH grants. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=202.16s)]
*  And we're subsidizing this food that's causing torture to children's metabolic health. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=208.22s)]
*  Tens of billions of dollars a year ago to subsidizing ultra processed food. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=214.17999999999998s)]
*  We can cut those subsidies with the stroke of a pen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  Stop subsidizing, stop recommending and give Americans flexibility, you know, flexible [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=222.0s)]
*  savings accounts to have their money go to food and exercise. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=227.8s)]
*  Well, it's an amazing topic. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=232.52s)]
*  It is the sleeper issue. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=234.48s)]
*  I think it's going to win a lot of women over as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=235.48s)]
*  Kelly, you've been instrumental in bringing this to the forefront, working with both candidates. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=237.8s)]
*  We thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=242.24s)]
*  More Fox and Friends coming up. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=245.08s)]
*  Thanks, Kelly. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=246.6s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=247.6s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=248.6s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZkP7GsJVFM&t=249.6s)]
