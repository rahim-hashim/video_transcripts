# US military takes control of key portion of border land
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY)
*  Well a 60 foot wide strip of federal land along the US Mexico border to be put under [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=0.0s)]
*  the control of our military to oversee security. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was there yesterday and spoke exclusively with Fox News. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=7.72s)]
*  Brooke Taylor live in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=12.0s)]
*  That is just north of the southern border. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=14.6s)]
*  Brooke what do you have today? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Hi Dana, well first I want to let you know as we're getting ready to go on air we just [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  saw a group of what appears to be these scouts with masks on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=23.04s)]
*  They were waving to us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=26.68s)]
*  One of them even joked that he's with the FBI. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=28.2s)]
*  Clearly we have a camera right in front of us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=30.28s)]
*  So they're most likely trying to find the right opportunity right now to smuggle people [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=32.44s)]
*  across and I'll tell you if you ask border patrol agents out here they'll probably tell [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=36.64s)]
*  you that these guys are in for a rude awakening if they try to do that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=41.0s)]
*  Especially this new move that you just mentioned. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  The White House tells me that that is going to give the military the authority to detain [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=47.84s)]
*  any illegal migrants that try and cross them over because they'll be trespassing on this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=52.92s)]
*  military owned land now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=57.88s)]
*  They'll hand them over to border patrol agents and they'll eventually be deported. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=60.68s)]
*  We got this exclusive access though as you mentioned to Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  as he signed these documents transferring a stretch of land along the border to the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  military for three years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=77.48s)]
*  It's all part of the Roosevelt Reservation which runs through parts of New Mexico, California [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=79.56s)]
*  and Arizona. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=84.84s)]
*  Secretary Burgum toured the New Mexico section, an area known for illegal crossings, gotaways [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=86.96s)]
*  and smuggling activities. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=91.96s)]
*  In the cartels in many cases they've got more funding, they've got more incentives, they've [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=94.8s)]
*  got more determination to it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=99.8s)]
*  I mean we're up against a real enemy here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  We need to make sure the border is secure not just to protect the citizens from bad [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=103.6s)]
*  actors that are entering but it's a real effect of national security. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=108.84s)]
*  And earlier this year President Trump declared a national emergency at the border. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=115.76s)]
*  This is all part of his efforts to ramp up military presence. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  In January we were there getting an exclusive first look at the military transporting illegal [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=123.92s)]
*  migrants back to their home countries on these removal flights using military planes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=129.24s)]
*  And the military has also been helping border patrol with surveillance. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=134.8s)]
*  Just last month a few weeks ago we got access to those striker vehicles that are being used [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=138.32s)]
*  to detect crossings. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=143.04s)]
*  And some of this latest move really marks a significant expansion of military authority [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  here at the border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=150.2s)]
*  And all of this comes as we continue to see those record low numbers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  Brooke Taylor, thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TupaapeldRY&t=157.23999999999998s)]
