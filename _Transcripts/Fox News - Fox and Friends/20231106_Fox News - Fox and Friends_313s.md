# Piers Morgan: This makes my stomach churn
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4)
*  Do you want to clear the air and clearly condemn the attack in Hamas today? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=0.0s)]
*  No, I want to clear the record. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  First of all, the Palestinian Authority is not what represents the Palestinian people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  It's the PLO. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=13.68s)]
*  Do you want to clear the air and condemn it? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=14.68s)]
*  De-designate the PLO from the terrorist list in the U.S. Congress. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=18.84s)]
*  But on that specific condemnation, it would just be a very quick answer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=22.96s)]
*  And allow me, Margaret, because I watched your interview with the Israeli ambassador [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=27.96s)]
*  and he said two things, very important. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=32.72s)]
*  He said, you know, those are unintended consequences. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=34.6s)]
*  Well, he had a chance, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Kingdom refusing to condemn [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Hamas terrorists as pro-Palestinian protesters hits the streets across the globe, including, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=43.92s)]
*  as you can see right there, London on Saturday. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=49.72s)]
*  Speaking of London, joining us right now from London is Piers Morgan, the host of Piers Morgan [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Uncensored on Fox Nation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=56.08s)]
*  Piers, good afternoon to you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Good afternoon, Steve. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=60.4s)]
*  This guy had it really easy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=62.44s)]
*  Just a yes or a no. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=63.96s)]
*  The correct answer is yes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=65.12s)]
*  He'd like to condemn the mass murder of innocent civilians, but he didn't do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=66.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=72.28s)]
*  You know, I've interviewed a lot of pro-Palestinian voices on my show Uncensored in the last month, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=73.92s)]
*  including that ambassador. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=78.52s)]
*  And I've asked all of them that question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=80.84s)]
*  Because to me, you can absolutely say that you're concerned about the plight of the Palestinians, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=83.64s)]
*  both before and after what happened on October the 7th. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=89.72s)]
*  That's completely normal and a completely human reaction. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=92.8s)]
*  However, however, if you're not prepared to condemn that appalling terror attack, then [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=95.72s)]
*  I'm afraid I don't want to hear you asking for condemnation of anything else. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=102.0s)]
*  So I start with that question. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  And his inability there repeatedly to just give a straight, of course I condemn it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=108.16s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  It's very telling. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  And you're seeing this in these demonstrations now all over the world. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  A lot of the people demonstrating are indeed genuine peace protesters. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=118.64s)]
*  And I respect that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  In democracy, you're allowed to demonstrate peacefully. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  However, they're getting infiltrated with more and more people who are blatantly pro-Hamas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  And Hamas is a terror organization. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  So when you stand there with your placards supporting Hamas or you chant jihad or from [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=135.72s)]
*  the river to the sea, which we all know means the eradication of Israel, which is the stated [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=140.96s)]
*  mission of Hamas, then you are promoting and supporting and endorsing terrorism. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=146.0s)]
*  And what happened on October the 7th? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=151.72s)]
*  And that is completely unacceptable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=153.64s)]
*  You know, Piers, as we were looking at some of the video of the protests there in London [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  on Saturday, great big protests in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=160.88s)]
*  They're estimating perhaps as many as 100,000 were marching. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=164.64s)]
*  And in addition to from the river to the sea that they chanted here, they also chanted [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=168.48s)]
*  F. Joe Biden. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=173.88s)]
*  So what were they, in addition to from the river to the sea, what else were they cheering [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=176.52s)]
*  and chanting there in London? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=180.6s)]
*  Oh, lots of abuse for our prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who has also stood up for Israel's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=182.84s)]
*  right to defend itself. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=187.96s)]
*  And indeed, not just a right, but in my estimation, it has a fundamental duty to protect his people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=189.44s)]
*  from an organization whose spokesman only last week reiterated that they want to do [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  what happened on October the 7th again and again and again and again. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=199.84s)]
*  So those people marching for the Palestinians, I get it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=204.56s)]
*  I get why people are concerned about the ferocity of Israel's response. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=207.64s)]
*  But I also ask them a simple question. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=212.64s)]
*  Do you think Hamas should stay in power in Gaza after what they did? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  And if, as most people answer, well, no, probably not, then in that case, how do you get rid [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=219.04s)]
*  of them? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=223.12s)]
*  Nobody has another answer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=224.28s)]
*  They lived deliberately amongst their own population, who they themselves have repressed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=226.0s)]
*  now for 17 years or so. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  And they will continue to do that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=232.56s)]
*  They spent a lot of the money that's been given to them supposedly to try and make the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=234.12s)]
*  Gaza a more prosperous place on just terrorizing Israelis. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=237.6s)]
*  And now on October the 7th, they did what they have warned they would do if they ever [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=242.4s)]
*  got the chance, and that is commit an effective genocide on the people of Israel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=246.12s)]
*  So these protests, we've got one, for example, on Saturday coming in London. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=251.12s)]
*  Now it's a very special day in London on Saturday. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  It's Armistice Day. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=257.48s)]
*  It's the day we celebrate the end of World War I. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=258.48s)]
*  It's also a day that forms part of a weekend of Remembrance Sunday and the Cenotaph in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=261.64s)]
*  London where we commemorate and remember and honor all those who lost their lives serving [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=266.32s)]
*  this country in war around the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  And the idea there are going to be huge mobs of people going around, some of whom will [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=274.48s)]
*  be promoting a terror organization as we're supposed to be celebrating and honoring the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=279.96s)]
*  memories of those who died in conflict against people like the Nazis, makes my stomach churn. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=285.52s)]
*  And that is why you are wearing a poppy today live from London. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=291.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=295.44s)]
*  And we have Veterans Day in this country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=296.44s)]
*  Piers, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=298.64s)]
*  Thanks a lot, guys. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=301.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=302.44s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=303.44s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jvx13Mbs_4&t=304.44s)]
