# Americans ‘can’t trust what’s on the ingredient label’: RFK Jr
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E)
*  R.F.K. Junior is throwing his support behind Donald Trump in part because he and the former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=0.0s)]
*  president agree on a number of key issues. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=6.9s)]
*  And that includes the American diet and what's in our food. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=9.52s)]
*  I also want to salute Bobby's decades of work as an advocate for the health of our families [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=13.88s)]
*  and our children. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Nobody's done more. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=20.6s)]
*  We talked about not about the things that separate us because we don't agree on everything, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=21.96s)]
*  but on the values and the issues that bind us together. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=27.92s)]
*  And one of the issues that he talked about was having safe food and ending the chronic [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=33.2s)]
*  disease epidemic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=39.04s)]
*  And don't you want a president that's going to make America healthy again? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=40.88s)]
*  Before his announcement, I spoke with Kennedy about this very topic and a potential position [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=46.8s)]
*  in the Trump White House. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=53.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  I thought it'd be great to just kind of look at some of these items because parents are [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=56.32s)]
*  encountering these food items in grocery stores everywhere. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=61.16s)]
*  Maybe we could just start right here with seed oils. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=63.96s)]
*  We are hearing a lot about seed oils. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=67.0s)]
*  Why should people be worried about these kind of products? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=68.88s)]
*  Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients that we have in foods. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=72.56s)]
*  Seed oils, the reason they're in the foods is because they're heavily subsidized. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=82.6s)]
*  They're very, very cheap, but they are associated with all kinds of very, very serious illnesses, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=88.76s)]
*  including body-wide inflammation, which affects all of our health. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=96.32s)]
*  It's one of the worst things you can eat, and it's almost impossible to avoid. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=102.92s)]
*  If you eat any processed foods, you're going to be eating seed oil. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=106.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=109.84s)]
*  Why would the government want to subsidize something that's going to make people sick, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=110.84s)]
*  and then in the end, we all end up paying for that in terms of health care costs, which [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  are skyrocketing? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=120.84s)]
*  Yeah, because that is a direct result of corruption. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=121.84s)]
*  About 75% of FDA's budget comes from regulated industry, and that means food processors and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=126.16s)]
*  pharmaceutical industry, all of them profit from a sick population. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=132.76s)]
*  By the way, it's getting very expensive, our cereals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=139.2s)]
*  Why is the food coloring in particular bad? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=141.56s)]
*  You see here, yellow food coloring, that is a petroleum product. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=145.6s)]
*  It's associated with depression. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=151.64s)]
*  It's associated with autoimmune injuries and ADHD. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=157.96s)]
*  And red dye also is very bad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=164.0s)]
*  In Europe, the same companies are producing the same products, but they're using natural [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=166.92s)]
*  coloring. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=172.88s)]
*  But here, they can get away with it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=173.88s)]
*  We have about almost 1,000 chemicals that are in our food that are either outright banned [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=176.48s)]
*  in Europe or actively discouraged. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  So you wouldn't be able to buy this kind of stuff in Europe. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=185.44s)]
*  You ask about why it's so cheap, why it's so ubiquitous. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  It's because we subsidize the worst foods. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=194.88s)]
*  We subsidize it with about 70% of our food stamp program is to process foods, which are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=197.32s)]
*  all poisoned. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=202.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=203.74s)]
*  One other thing that's interesting is you'll see on labels, natural flavors, which is this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=204.74s)]
*  catch-off phrase that I guess was lobbied for, but the ingredients in natural flavors [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=209.04s)]
*  are not really natural. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=215.32s)]
*  No. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=216.32s)]
*  In our country, natural flavors aren't chemical products. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=217.32s)]
*  You can't trust what's on the ingredient label. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=222.04s)]
*  And the reason for that, again, is government corruption. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=225.04s)]
*  It's that the agency, the USDA, the FDA have been captured by the industries they're supposed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=227.6s)]
*  to regulate. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=234.04s)]
*  And they all have an interest in subsidies and then in mass poisoning the American public. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=235.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=241.92s)]
*  I want to talk about pesticides, and then let's talk about the policies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=242.92s)]
*  So let's talk about the pesticides and the things that worry you about. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=245.68s)]
*  I mean, this looks like fresh food, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=248.64s)]
*  What should I be worried about here? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=251.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=252.28s)]
*  I mean, the irony is, for example, my wife loves kale, and she had the impression that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=253.28s)]
*  kale is actually good for you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=257.64s)]
*  If it's organic, it's very good for you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=261.28s)]
*  But most kale and strawberries, for example, grapes, are contaminated with pesticides. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=263.56s)]
*  And particularly the environmental working group has found what they call the dirty dozen, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=271.24s)]
*  some of the worst pesticides on these products. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=275.84s)]
*  So, you know, I look at a strawberry and I think, oh, this is a healthy food. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=279.96s)]
*  But in most cases, unless it's organic, certified organic, you are getting something that's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=284.88s)]
*  actually hurting you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=290.52s)]
*  What can be done at a government level to stop this and make people get healthy? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=292.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=296.6s)]
*  As president, I'll issue an executive order on day one that anybody who is recommending [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=297.6s)]
*  food products and USDA or FDA at any of those committees, if you are going to be on those [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=302.32s)]
*  committees, you have to have no conflict of interest. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=308.96s)]
*  We spend five times our military budget on chronic disease. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=311.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=317.32s)]
*  And it's made us the sickest population in the world. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=318.32s)]
*  And if you wonder why we're the sickest people in the world, why do we have these epidemics [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=321.8s)]
*  of ADHD and depression and all these kind of psychiatric illnesses that have been linked [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  by the science to these kind of foods, to the ingredients of these foods, and why do [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=336.48s)]
*  we have these neurological disorders, all this epidemic of autoimmune disease. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=342.36s)]
*  So many of these products are geared towards children, which I think is what's really tragic [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=347.44s)]
*  about it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=351.6s)]
*  It's sort of like you're putting them at a very early age on this pathway to chronic [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=352.6s)]
*  disease. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=356.64s)]
*  And then at the end of that is pharma to sort of cure whatever the food did to you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=357.64s)]
*  The advisors who actually choose the nutrition guidelines are almost all of corrupted. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=363.76s)]
*  They're conflicted. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=369.68s)]
*  Are you willing to take on a position like this in the Trump administration as healths [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=370.68s)]
*  are? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=375.84s)]
*  Well, one way or the other, I'm going to be fighting to get this stuff out of our food. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=376.84s)]
*  I mean, we're poisoned. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=380.44s)]
*  We have a generation of kids that are swimming around in a toxic soup right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=381.8s)]
*  And we need to, you know, we're betraying them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=387.68s)]
*  We're supposed to be taking care of our kids and we're letting these industries corrupt [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=391.48s)]
*  our agencies and mass poison them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=395.72s)]
*  And you know, nobody in the world has a chronic disease epidemic of the kind that we have [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=398.32s)]
*  in this country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=404.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=405.0s)]
*  I think it's a sleeper issue of this election. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=406.0s)]
*  So I really appreciate you coming on, explaining this, breaking it down and laying out your [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=408.6s)]
*  policies. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=412.56s)]
*  Rachel, thanks for having me and thanks for paying attention to this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=413.56s)]
*  I think I know that it's difficult in your position to go up against powerful industries. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=416.64s)]
*  I'm glad you're telling the truth. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42G68Hdq4E&t=424.04s)]
