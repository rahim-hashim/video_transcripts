# Biden-Harris under fire for 'ridiculous' leaks from Netanyahu meeting: 'Incompetence'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu reportedly telling President Biden he's willing to strike Iran's military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=0.0s)]
*  rather than oil or nuclear facilities, pointing to a more limited counter-strike despite high tensions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=5.84s)]
*  Retired Army National Guard Major General John King is speaking at Donald Trump's rally in Atlanta today [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=11.8s)]
*  on the dangers of our troops are facing under Biden and Harris' command. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=17.14s)]
*  And join us with more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=21.2s)]
*  First off, Major General, it's outrageous. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=22.48s)]
*  Another leak to the Washington Post from confidential meetings between Netanyahu and this administration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=24.88s)]
*  Good morning, Brian. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=33.84s)]
*  It's absolutely ridiculous that we would telegraph or we will allow Israeli's defense to be telegraphed to the Iranians. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=34.64s)]
*  You know, it's just it's just not serious. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=44.16s)]
*  These these people at the White House are not serious about not only our allies, but the defense of our nation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=47.92s)]
*  So let's get this straight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  If if General Biden had his way, they never went into to Rafa, found those tunnels and unearthed maybe four or five [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=54.8s)]
*  battalions of Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=62.72s)]
*  If General Biden had his way, they wouldn't have went into Hezbollah, taken out all their command and blown them up [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=63.92s)]
*  at least 3000 Hezbollah warfighters with their pagers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=69.92s)]
*  And they would not have moved in and blown up those tunnels that go right to the UN facilities. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=74.4s)]
*  And now General Biden is stopping them by exposing them about different sites he wants them to hit. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=78.72s)]
*  When are they going to learn that his instincts are terrible? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=86.08s)]
*  That's what this election is so important, Brian, because my goodness, the people of Israel, the people of America [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=90.24s)]
*  should not be holding their breath because of this administration incompetence. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=96.16s)]
*  That's that's the only thing you can call it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=100.8s)]
*  The the Israelis have been taking the hit for United States all the way back to Desert Storm. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  The Iraqis struck with Scud missiles into Tel Aviv and we requested the Israelis not respond. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=110.8s)]
*  We would not do that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=118.0s)]
*  And it's unreasonable for us to expect the Israelis to do the same. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=119.36s)]
*  Let's take a look at their failures. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  August 26th, 13 U.S. members died at Abbey Gate, a bombing that we knew was going to happen and withdrawal [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=125.52s)]
*  that should never have taken place. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=130.96s)]
*  August 30th, we leave that country, turn it over to the Taliban. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=132.56s)]
*  Al Qaeda is now back and Bin Laden's son now running things in Afghanistan. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=136.08s)]
*  February 24, 2022, Russia invades Ukraine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=141.04s)]
*  We telegraphed it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=144.8s)]
*  We allowed it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=145.84s)]
*  We didn't get Ukraine ready for it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=146.56s)]
*  And then Hamas attacks Israel, our intelligence and their intelligence weren't able to foresee this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=148.32s)]
*  So what would you do? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=153.84s)]
*  What targets would you hit? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=156.08s)]
*  Everything should be on the table. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  And we should not, you know, our allies should not be, I mean, the defense of their way of life, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=160.4s)]
*  their nation, but also look at the risk that we're putting our service members on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=165.68s)]
*  This is America's treasure, our young men and women serving in uniform. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  When we telegraph to our enemies that what's on the table, what's off the table, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=175.12s)]
*  we're putting our service members at greater risk. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=180.0s)]
*  And that's unacceptable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  All right, Major General John King, thanks so much. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=184.24s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=186.96s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1kuxsPP-Jk&t=187.84s)]
