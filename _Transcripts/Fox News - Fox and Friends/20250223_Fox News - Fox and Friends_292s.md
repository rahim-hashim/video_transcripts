# CPAC crowd cheers GOP rep's anti-woke address
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs)
*  I bring you greetings from the great state of Wyoming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=0.0s)]
*  Home of an abundance of affordable and reliable energy, wildlife galore, wide open spaces, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=4.0s)]
*  gorgeous rivers and streams, magnificent mountains, beautiful blue skies, and not one loose chain [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=14.24s)]
*  anywhere to be found. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  That rousing, cease-back speech earning Congresswoman Harriet Higman a standing ovation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=26.12s)]
*  yesterday and as chair of House Anti-Woke Caucus, I didn't know we had that caucus, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=31.76s)]
*  happy to hear about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=37.56s)]
*  There's no shortage of material to talk about with her. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=39.0s)]
*  Joining me now with more of her message, Wyoming Congresswoman Harriet Higman. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=41.88s)]
*  Welcome, Congresswoman. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Great to have you on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=47.72s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=48.72s)]
*  It's good to be here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=49.72s)]
*  So let's talk about Liz Cheney before we go any further. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=51.36s)]
*  First of all, I know people love you just for being you, but they also love you because [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=54.56s)]
*  it means that Liz Cheney is gone. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Explain to me, what happened to Liz Cheney and her dad? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=60.28s)]
*  What happened? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=63.2s)]
*  They went a different direction. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=64.2s)]
*  And I think that they believed that Donald Trump was going to be the past. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  And I believe that they were looking at her potentially being speaker of the House and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=70.12s)]
*  running for president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=74.26s)]
*  And that just simply didn't work out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=75.26s)]
*  And I think she's incredibly frustrated and angry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=76.68s)]
*  And I think that they miscalculated where the Republican Party is and where conservatives [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=79.88s)]
*  You know, one of the things I really like about Liz Cheney is that Liz Cheney and Dick [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=85.16s)]
*  Cheney are a reminder, excuse me, a reminder that there truly is a uni party in Washington, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=90.28s)]
*  D.C. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=97.4s)]
*  Isn't that right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=98.4s)]
*  I think that that really played out for all of the world to see this last election. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=99.4s)]
*  They were willing to get behind Kamala Harris. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=103.58s)]
*  And regardless of how you may feel about Donald Trump, everyone has to admit that the last [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  four years have been absolutely a disaster. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=110.2s)]
*  She's been in the front seat of the car with Joe Biden. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=113.72000000000001s)]
*  So the idea that you would support her and try to put her in the White House is just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  stunning to me. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=121.2s)]
*  You know, Congressman, we just were talking on the couch about peace finally breaking [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=122.2s)]
*  out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=126.68s)]
*  This week, we may see an end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=127.68s)]
*  And I think it's probably Liz Cheney and that uni party's obsession with war versus trying [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=131.28s)]
*  to find peace and resolution and negotiations that really stands out for me, especially [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=138.08s)]
*  at this moment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=142.68s)]
*  There's big money in war. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=144.28s)]
*  That's why we call it the military industrial complex. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=145.52s)]
*  And there's been big money in all different kinds of things, such as the, you know, the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=148.58s)]
*  censorship industrial complex. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=153.8s)]
*  We've seen these things play out over the last several years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=155.56s)]
*  And one of the things that we can thank President Trump for is his pure honesty and his transparency [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=158.24s)]
*  and exposing so many of the things in Washington, D.C. that people have known existed that are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=163.72s)]
*  there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=169.4s)]
*  We've never necessarily been able to put our finger on them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=170.52s)]
*  And this is really an incredible time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  I refer to it as a renaissance. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=175.68s)]
*  This is a time for us to have a new beginning and to really right size our government, to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=177.52s)]
*  be able to move forward on a policy that is in the best interest of the American citizen. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=183.28s)]
*  So Congresswoman, you are part of the Anti-Woke Caucus. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Tell me what you guys are taking on in that caucus. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=192.16s)]
*  So it is all of the social justice type of things that have sprung up over the last several [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  years that have really undermined the foundation of this country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=201.88s)]
*  We are we are built on the concept of equality. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=206.08s)]
*  We are built on the concept that everyone has innate value. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=209.44s)]
*  We are built on the concept of entrepreneurship and everyone having an opportunity. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  This is the land of opportunity. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=218.34s)]
*  And over the last several years, we've had the idea of government kind of slicing and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=219.96s)]
*  dicing us based upon our race, based upon based upon sex, based upon sexual orientation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=224.8s)]
*  And it's really undermined so much of what America is. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=230.84s)]
*  And again, it is that land of opportunity where anyone can succeed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  I am an example of that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  I grew up on a ranch outside of a little town in Wyoming. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=239.84s)]
*  And here I am a member of Congress. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  And in the United States, you can have that kind of a success story. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=249.36s)]
*  You mentioned the military industrial complex. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  There is a censorship industrial complex. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=253.32s)]
*  There is a woke industrial complex. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=255.44s)]
*  There's money being made in all of that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=258.48s)]
*  And thankfully, we have Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and of course, the Congress working [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=260.36s)]
*  hand in glove with them to dismantle those complexes and give the money back to the people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=266.72s)]
*  And we thank you for joining us today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=272.68s)]
*  And fabulous speech last night. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=275.72s)]
*  You had such a great reception. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=277.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=279.62s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=280.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctMJuwHsrs&t=283.28s)]
