# First responders go viral for 'A Christmas Story' parody
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk)
*  One year after their viral parody of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, the first responders [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=0.0s)]
*  of Savage, Minnesota are back at it with a spin on a Christmas story. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=6.16s)]
*  Come on, Donnie Eater, just do it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=12.86s)]
*  All right, all right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=14.88s)]
*  Chek's spine stiffened, his lips curled in a defiant sneer. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=16.6s)]
*  There was no going back now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=21.92s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=24.44s)]
*  Back by popular demand, Police Sergeant Eric Chek and Assistant Fire Chief Chad Martin [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=34.44s)]
*  joining us alongside the rest of the cast. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  What you guys do is so amazing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=44.24s)]
*  It just is the greatest segment. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=47.0s)]
*  Last year we had you guys on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=48.92s)]
*  This year you've outdone yourself. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=51.0s)]
*  Whose idea was it to come up, Eric, with this year's theme? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=52.92s)]
*  All the props go to our media and communication team. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=60.88s)]
*  They do a great job. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=64.2s)]
*  They come up with these skits every year and they just keep pumping them out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=65.2s)]
*  It's just fun to be a part of it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=68.92s)]
*  But were you surprised, Eric, when they said, we've got a great idea and it involves you [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=70.6s)]
*  sticking your tongue on a fire hydrant? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  Any pushback from that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=77.2s)]
*  Well, truth be told, they called me up and said, hey, the talent pool is a little shallow [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=79.4s)]
*  on the fire department. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  So we need the cops to come in and deepen that up a little bit. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=85.44s)]
*  So I was happy to help out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=91.36s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=93.68s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=94.68s)]
*  Chad, so take us behind the scenes a little bit because this isn't like a one hour thing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=95.68s)]
*  you do. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=100.84s)]
*  This has quite a lot of effort and a lot of people to pull this off. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=101.84s)]
*  Take me behind the scenes and tell me about it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=105.64s)]
*  There was a lot of production going on all day long. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  I wasn't prepared for that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  It was my first year doing this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  And I walked in and they said, here's your lines. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=113.12s)]
*  We're doing this today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=115.56s)]
*  And yeah, you can imagine that's going to be a few hours of trying to figure it out [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=116.56s)]
*  as we go through that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, it was a lot of fun. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  And again, like he said, our communications department puts all that together and they [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=122.4s)]
*  did a great job making it all work. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=126.4s)]
*  Eric, why do you guys do it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=128.88s)]
*  You know, it's really to show the heart behind the badge, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=132.96s)]
*  The police and the fire badge to really connect with our community and put a face to all [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=137.36s)]
*  those bright, shining lights when we show up on these calls all throughout the year, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=143.72000000000003s)]
*  and especially during this Christmas season. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's certainly taken a nationwide trend and we are so grateful all of us across the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  country for those men and women behind badges. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=158.24s)]
*  Chad, let me ask you, though, I want you to tell some tales out of school here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=161.68s)]
*  Did Eric complain at all about this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=166.72s)]
*  How many times you have to shoot that scene or was he tough? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=169.16s)]
*  I'm really glad that you got his tongue stuck to that hydrant for a long time, to be honest. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=173.04s)]
*  That was the quietest part we had all day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=176.6s)]
*  It was lovely. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=178.72s)]
*  So I love it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=179.56s)]
*  I love it. Well, Eric and Chad, thank you so much. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=183.32s)]
*  And Eric, I'll just give you the last few seconds. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=187.04s)]
*  Is there a Christmas message that you have from your guys there and what do you plan [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  to do next year? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=194.04s)]
*  Well, yes, I'd like to say Merry Christmas to everyone watching today. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=197.16s)]
*  Shout out to my wife and two girls, Alexis and Zoe. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=201.84s)]
*  And next year is I know there's something in the works. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=205.16s)]
*  They don't share it with the talent, but I know there's something. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=208.6s)]
*  Keep everyone in suspense. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcCKqJjMUJk&t=211.6s)]
