# Joe Concha: This sounded like a threat
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs)
*  The Democrats are ready to elect a new DNC chair today as the party faces an identity [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=0.0s)]
*  crisis following those huge losses in 2024. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=6.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, the White House is demanding an apology from Democrats after House Minority [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=9.6s)]
*  Leader Hakeem Jeffries said this about countering Trump's agenda. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=14.48s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=19.2s)]
*  We are going to fight it legislatively. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=20.2s)]
*  We are going to fight it in the courts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=24.72s)]
*  We are going to fight it in the streets. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=27.28s)]
*  Here with his reaction is Fox News contributor Joe Concha. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  Great to see you this morning, Joe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=34.96s)]
*  So do you get the sense that maybe Democrats might still be a little bit kind of in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=36.72s)]
*  wilderness? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=42.96s)]
*  Just, oh, deep in the wilderness. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=43.96s)]
*  We're talking about like Robin Hood kind of wilderness at this point, Charlie. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=46.96s)]
*  When you hear fight them in the streets. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=50.72s)]
*  Walk in the woods with your Chardonnay Hillary wilderness. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=52.8s)]
*  Ah, yes, that's better, Rachel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=56.32s)]
*  Touche. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=58.52s)]
*  Maybe it's me, but that kind of sounded like a threat, right? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  That sounds like a call to Black Lives Matter, Antifa, violent alt-left groups. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's so reminiscent of Maxine Waters, right, with that similar divisive, potentially [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=66.68s)]
*  dangerous rhetoric imploring Democrat supporters to get up in the faces of anyone who's a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=70.76s)]
*  member of the Trump administration. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=76.4s)]
*  Remember that during the first term? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=77.64s)]
*  And it actually happened. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=79.04s)]
*  Just ask, you know, Rand Paul, for example, or Cory Booker or even Joe Biden saying they [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=80.16s)]
*  would physically attack Donald Trump if they had the chance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=84.92s)]
*  And they did so on national television. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=87.44s)]
*  There is a poll out this week, Quinnipiac, I believe, that showed that the Democratic [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=89.56s)]
*  Party has never been this unpopular in the history of their polling. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=93.68s)]
*  We're talking decades, just 31 percent. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=97.84s)]
*  Think about that. Less than one third of Americans approve of the Democrat Party right [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=100.04s)]
*  now. And the reasons are simple. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=104.04s)]
*  They have no message. They have no solutions. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=105.56s)]
*  They just got spanked in the last election when they have virtually no power now in terms [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=107.56s)]
*  of majority in the House, in the Senate, more governors, a Republican than Democrat. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=112.04s)]
*  The Supreme Court is six to three conservative in theory anyway. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=116.12s)]
*  And oh, yeah, the candidate they installed, their nominee without one vote in an effort [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  to save democracy or something, that was considered to be the worst campaign we have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  seen in our lifetime. So, yeah, you want to take the fight to the streets. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  OK, it's a bold strategy. Let's see if it works out for them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=132.32s)]
*  Here's what the White House responded to it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=135.44s)]
*  Let's see if we can pull this up. They said Democrats are ready to elect a new DNC chair. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=137.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. They. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=141.68s)]
*  We lost. Oh, here we go. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=143.36s)]
*  Here it is. Put it back up for us. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  This unhinged violent rhetoric is dangerous. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=147.08s)]
*  Leader Jeffrey should immediately apologize. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Joe, what about the hypocrisy of this? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=152.32s)]
*  If Donald Trump had said this, any Republican had said we're going to we're going to take [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  to the streets. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  We're going to fight on the streets. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=160.44s)]
*  What would have happened? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=162.44s)]
*  Yeah. Insurrection. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=163.44s)]
*  The store that sells the pitchforks that you protest with, they would run out of the pitchforks, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  right? That's exactly what would happen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=169.84s)]
*  And by the way, if we're talking about the context of the King, Jeffrey's comment, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=171.52s)]
*  he was talking about protecting those who are here illegally. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=175.44000000000003s)]
*  A decided majority of Americans support deportation, especially when it comes to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=178.4s)]
*  murderers, rapists, career criminals who enter this country illegally. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  They're taking the 20 side of an 80 20 side in the 20 support and 80 is against [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=186.68s)]
*  or 80 support and 20 is against. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=192.72000000000003s)]
*  You don't want to be on that side as a party. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  And that's why the rudder is right now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  They have no leader and they have no message, guys. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=198.52s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see, you know, how to how it goes to elect a new DNC chair. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=200.36s)]
*  Will it be the weakest link that everyone can meh about or will it be some dynamic [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=204.6s)]
*  Donald Trump like figure? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=209.4s)]
*  I think the former is probably it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=210.6s)]
*  Meh for speaker. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=213.76s)]
*  Thanks, guys. Have a good weekend. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=216.04s)]
*  You're working. Sorry. Have a good weekend after the weekend. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=217.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvsB_Qhkbs&t=220.44s)]
