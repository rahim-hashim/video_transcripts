# ‘Faith in the fire’: Kym Douglas on finding hope amid wildfire destruction
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U)
*  Our next guest is from Brentwood, California, which is dangerously close to the Palisades fire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=0.0s)]
*  She's urging her a hard-hit community to lean into their faith [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=5.16s)]
*  Strategic advisor to the faith in media coalition and host of your healthy dose podcast Kim Douglas [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=9.52s)]
*  Joins us now with her message of hope Kim before we get to the message of hope [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=16.92s)]
*  I'm always you know, we see these images on on TV and it's heart-wrenching [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=21.34s)]
*  But I don't think people have a complete perspective of just how devastating this is in a minute ago [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=27.34s)]
*  You're talking about how many of your friends? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=34.1s)]
*  Woke up, you know, they don't have a toothbrush run out of the house. No birth certificates [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=37.34s)]
*  No [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=42.86s)]
*  Passports not even a toothbrush and like we had talked before we came on my friend Jake Seinfeld and his wife Tracy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  It's just ashes their car everything just 82 friends or acquaintances of mine have all been displaced and lost their homes [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=51.13999999999999s)]
*  It's just incredible. So when you have something like this that is so life-altering [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=58.9s)]
*  It's everything you know about life just [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=63.86s)]
*  Vanishes or at least physically vanishes like that. How do you how where do you pick up the pieces? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=67.06s)]
*  Such an important question, you know [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  I've been thinking about it a lot and in prayer and it's like it's so important to have faith in the fire and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  What I find is that in Los Angeles Charlie, we tend to figuratively speaking and in every way [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=83.02s)]
*  We stay in our own lane. We get on the 405 to the 101 to the 170 and you can have neighbors [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=91.38s)]
*  You wouldn't even know their name for five years. You just no one really gets around each other [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=98.38s)]
*  You just stay in your lane. You shoot your movie you drop your album [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=103.94s)]
*  But what I found is that in this city of angels that everyone stays in their own lane [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=107.66s)]
*  The things that are coming forward now. No one cares about your next movie. Nobody cares about the album right now [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=112.78s)]
*  it's what your neighbor is bringing over to you in the form of a toothbrush or [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  Where you're gonna sleep tomorrow and I feel like that's so important that when God does when everything's stripped away [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=125.1s)]
*  That's when we do need to look to our faith and in the scriptures [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=131.92s)]
*  It says that God will take our tears and put them in a bottle seal it and give us hope and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=135.88s)]
*  In the city of angels right now. I really do feel that churches like Vintage Church or [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=142.32s)]
*  Operation blessing that's in the parking lot of Bel Air Church and Dream Center [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=148.28s)]
*  They're just the people that are coming forward now and they are the stars of California [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=152.88s)]
*  And you know when you think about how this is not a short-term problem [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=158.26s)]
*  This is a product gonna go on for a long time [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=162.58s)]
*  Infrastructure is gonna be years before it comes back and and you you know, it is a commandment to have hope [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsKfZA2kZ_U&t=164.9s)]
