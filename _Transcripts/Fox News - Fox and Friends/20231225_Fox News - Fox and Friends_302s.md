# 'Messages of morals,' I believe
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk)
*  And as millions are celebrating Christmas under the cloud of war that Trey was just talking about, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=0.0s)]
*  our next guest says Israel holds a very special place in his heart and has spent plenty of time there [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=5.44s)]
*  visiting every single holy site, many of them with his son. Actor Dean Cain joins us now with his Christmas message [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  and with a beautiful Christmas tree behind you. Dean, good morning to you and Merry Christmas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=19.28s)]
*  Good morning, Carly. Merry Christmas and thank you for having me on. I appreciate it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=25.12s)]
*  Absolutely, we're so happy to have you on and to talk about this, it is so important on this Christmas morning, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=28.4s)]
*  we also have to recognize that Israel is still at war and there are so many people suffering and so many people who feel lost [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  and clearly Israel is a place that is near and dear to your heart. So is what is happening over there, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=41.12s)]
*  has that changed how you are reflecting on Christmas this year? Well, yeah, of course it has. I mean, I have so many friends who are Israeli. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=46.16s)]
*  I have a lot of friends who are Muslim. To see this happening there is heartbreaking and it's terrible [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=54.4s)]
*  and you just feel for the people who are suffering there. It's unfortunate, you know, I wish that Hamas [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=60.56s)]
*  hadn't started this on October 7th, but I think that that's very clear to anybody who's clear [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  thinking that's what took place. And I think Israel has every right to defend itself and finish this, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=73.28s)]
*  but it's horrible. The actual human cost and the suffering is absolutely terrible that I think none of us [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=77.84s)]
*  root for except for, you know, people like Hamas, they root for this sort of thing and it's awful [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=84.32s)]
*  and it's terrible and my heart breaks for them, especially on this Christmas morning. Absolutely and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=89.52s)]
*  you visited, we were showing some of those great pictures of you visiting Israel during a more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=93.6s)]
*  peaceful time with your son. What was that like and why did you want to bring your son to visit [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=98.08s)]
*  those holy sites in Israel? It's one of the most amazing trips I've ever taken in my lifetime. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=102.88s)]
*  My son is my favorite human being. He's a wonderful one. He's sleeping up there. There's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=109.36s)]
*  no chance he's awake right now. It's not even six a.m. here, but it was just so great and so [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=114.08s)]
*  special for me to share those moments with him and those sites that you read about in the Bible [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=118.64s)]
*  and discuss our faith and like even that shot there, that's the slab of rock that Jesus was [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=124.56s)]
*  laid upon after he was crucified. I mean that's the Wailing Mall. That stuff is so special to me [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=130.48s)]
*  and it was such an incredible time. It is the Holy Land and I encourage everybody at a safer time [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=135.28s)]
*  to go and visit, but please do support Israel as I do a thousand percent. Well we're celebrating [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=140.8s)]
*  Christmas today Dean, but we're also looking to the future into 2024 and there is an interesting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  trend that we noticed and it's that there are more faith-based movies that are coming out now [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=152.56s)]
*  than in any time in my life that I remember and they're really popular. There was Jesus Revolution. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=158.4s)]
*  We just had Neil McDonough on the show last week who's a great guy and yeah fantastic. I always [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=163.68s)]
*  play the bad guy, but he is so religious and such a wonderful person. He's in a movie called The [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Shift right now where he plays the devil, but it's the story of Job and I recommend everybody see it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  Have you noticed this trend of more faith-based movies coming out and becoming popular? Why do [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=180.4s)]
*  you think that is? Have I noticed Carly? I've been in like 50 of them. I love it. I think it's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=185.92s)]
*  because you know the things that are put forward, the messages that are put forward in these faith-based [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=193.28s)]
*  films are messages of morals, of right and wrong and I think that in our society today we really [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=198.56s)]
*  really can use those messages. I think we've gone awry in a lot of areas in what we're teaching and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=207.44s)]
*  what we're doing. What we're teaching our children and I think those strong messages, they don't have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=213.44s)]
*  to be overtly religious, but I think they really really really have an effect on our youth and I [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=218.8s)]
*  think that's insanely important. In my household right now there's like 10 people here, five of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  them are kids under the age of you know 13. We're going to watch It's a Wonderful Life today because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=229.12s)]
*  it's my favorite movie of all time and the messages are so wonderful and I think that's what's happening [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=234.0s)]
*  is people are gravitating towards those messages because it's the time that we need them. Yeah I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=238.8s)]
*  couldn't agree with you more. I watched It's a Wonderful Life last night with my husband. It's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=243.36s)]
*  one of my favorites too and I think you're right about sometimes those subtle messages that are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=246.56s)]
*  subtly religious are more impactful especially for young people because then you could talk to your [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=250.88s)]
*  kids about it. It becomes a personal moment as well so yeah that's a great point so keep making [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=255.28s)]
*  those faith-based films and have a very Merry Christmas celebrating with your son and your [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=260.08s)]
*  family. Dean we thank you so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. I didn't even get out of my robe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=263.76s)]
*  I was wondering if it was a robe or a sweater so you tricked me but now your secret [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=268.8s)]
*  has been revealed. Dean thank you so much. Would you guys rather be in your robes than having coffee? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=276.4s)]
*  Yeah we would but that's okay we are here all decked out which we appreciate. We're very grateful [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq6iIe1g_Zk&t=281.76s)]
