# Trump 'losing patience' with Elon Musk over 'big, beautiful bill'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw)
*  Meanwhile, here back home, everyone is wondering, is the big, beautiful bill going to be passed? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=0.0s)]
*  And one of the people is an ally of the president, Elon Musk. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=5.96s)]
*  He said this on Wednesday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=9.6s)]
*  Call your senators, call your congressmen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=11.96s)]
*  Bangor-rupting America is not okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=14.48s)]
*  He's advocating to kill the bill, Ainsley. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Then there's an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning that says Trump is losing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=20.0s)]
*  patience with Musk's outburst over the mega bill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=23.28s)]
*  They write, a senior White House official said Trump wasn't happy about Musk's decision [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=26.96s)]
*  to lambast his signature legislation, describing the president as confused as to why the Tesla [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=31.92s)]
*  chief executive decided to ratchet up his criticism after working so closely with the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=37.68s)]
*  president for four months. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=43.0s)]
*  The official said senior Trump advisors were caught off guard by Musk's latest offensive. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=49.96s)]
*  There's some speculation that he's upset that his pick for NASA, to run NASA, was not confirmed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=51.96s)]
*  He went with somebody else. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=57.76s)]
*  The green car credit as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=59.04s)]
*  And he's upset about the tax subsidy for electric cars. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=60.84s)]
*  But keep in mind, this bill is really not a spending bill. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=65.36s)]
*  They're trying to make the tax cuts permanent, build up the military, and build up the border. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=68.52s)]
*  Those are pretty much what President Trump ran on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=73.66s)]
*  He's got between $600 and $800 billion in cuts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=75.76s)]
*  Senator Josh Hawley says too much cuts to Medicaid. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=79.56s)]
*  Some Republicans like Rand Pogo, not enough cuts to Medicaid. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=81.56s)]
*  Same thing with the House. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=85.56s)]
*  Same thing with Susan College. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=86.56s)]
*  Too much cuts to Medicaid. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=88.2s)]
*  Ron Johnson, not enough cuts to Medicaid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  So the president has got to run this orchestra, along with the speaker and majority leader. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  It is not his option to sit on the sideline and snipe. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  I can't believe Musk doesn't understand that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=101.56s)]
*  The problem that Musk is running into is that he's done a lot of this with a lot of his [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=104.52s)]
*  companies where he's the ultimate decision maker. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=109.24s)]
*  He doesn't have to go to different congressmen from different states to get approval. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=112.08s)]
*  And so he thought when he became the head of DOJ under the leadership of the president, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=117.72s)]
*  when he did all these cuts, that they were going to be permanent because he did all the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=122.28s)]
*  work there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=126.44s)]
*  Well, the government just doesn't work there. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=127.44s)]
*  There can also be a second reconciliation bill if they're not happy with how this one [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=129.36s)]
*  goes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=133.6s)]
*  There could also be changes to the budget in September. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=134.6s)]
*  But you have the head of the Senate, head in the House. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=135.6s)]
*  You have John Thune and Speaker Johnson reacting to this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=138.24s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=141.56s)]
*  We're a long ways down this track and we realize that this is a bill that the House spent a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=142.56s)]
*  lot of time analyzing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  We spent, I think we've said we've had like 18 different meetings now with the Senate [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=151.36s)]
*  Finance Committee and we're committed to making a law that will make the lives of the American [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  people better. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  And so we are moving forward and I'm hopeful that at the end we'll have 51 votes in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=161.2s)]
*  Senate. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=167.2s)]
*  We don't have time for a brand new bill and I want Elon and all my friends to recognize [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=168.2s)]
*  the complexity of what we've accomplished here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  This extraordinary piece of legislation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=174.16s)]
*  We're proud of this product. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=175.76s)]
*  The House Republicans are proud of it and we're happy to go out and explain that to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=176.76s)]
*  everybody. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=180.12s)]
*  By the way, I think that they're betting on the growth. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=181.12s)]
*  They bet if you give people more of their own money, if you put investment into these [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=184.6s)]
*  especially when it comes to energy, this country will grow more than the 1.8 percent the Office [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=188.84s)]
*  of Management and Budget thinks it will. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=195.24s)]
*  So right now the nonprofit CBO, they say nonpartisan, CBO says we're only going to grow 1.8 percent [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=197.44000000000003s)]
*  is going to add X amount to the deficit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  Not if everything goes the way it did last time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  You can get the growth necessary to work on the deficit down the line. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  The CBO also to your point, Brian, they don't include the tariffs and they also don't include [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  the cuts that were made. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  You made 69 billion in tariffs so far. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=221.8s)]
*  So they're not included in that when they scored this bill. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morHMhfptaw&t=222.8s)]
