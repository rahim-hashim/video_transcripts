# Biden's latest move is 'absolutely unacceptable': Rep. Elise Stefanik
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E)
*  Fox News, we're now the Biden administration confirming, confirming it is holding back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=0.0s)]
*  a shipment of 3500 bombs to Israel over concerns that the weapons could be used in the invasion [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=4.0s)]
*  of Rafa in southern Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Today CIA Director Bill Burns and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu are reportedly set [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=11.88s)]
*  to hold meetings in Jerusalem as the U.S. looks to help broker a hostage deal and cease [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=16.42s)]
*  fire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=22.04s)]
*  Let's bring in Republican Congress Conference Chair Elise Stefanik. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=23.04s)]
*  She sits on the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=26.68s)]
*  Congresswoman, I never thought we'd come to a point where Israel would be at war and we're [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=28.8s)]
*  holding back weapons. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=32.88s)]
*  How did we get here? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=34.62s)]
*  It's absurd, Brian, and it's just another example where President Joe Biden has failed [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=36.32s)]
*  to support our most precious ally Israel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=40.84s)]
*  Congress passed supplemental funding and military aid to Israel, and it is outrageous and is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=44.06s)]
*  not complying with congressional intent the fact that the Biden administration is holding [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=50.08s)]
*  these back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=54.08s)]
*  This is as Israel has suffered its bloodiest day since the Holocaust with the terrorist [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=55.74s)]
*  attack on October 7th. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=60.06s)]
*  They're fighting for their very existence. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=61.5s)]
*  So House Republicans are pushing back both in our oversight capacity as well as conversations [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=63.32s)]
*  between the Speaker of the House and the President of the United States about how this is absolutely [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  unacceptable. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  But what's weird is that none of these bombs would be used in a place like Rafa. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  There are 2000 pound bombs, 1700, 500 pound bombs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=79.62s)]
*  That's not what they're using in Rafa. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=85.48s)]
*  This is what they would use against Hezbollah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=90.72s)]
*  And it just goes to show that the Biden administration and Joe Biden himself have failed to support [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=91.98s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=96.76s)]
*  They're more concerned about their pro-Hamas wing of the Democrat Party, which we're seeing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=97.98s)]
*  as part of the radicalized left. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=102.42s)]
*  And it's a stark contrast with Republicans who strongly support Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=105.12s)]
*  And we are going to continue to take that stance. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=110.04s)]
*  We again, remember, brought that Israel aid package to the floor multiple times as the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=112.56s)]
*  Democrat support cratered. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=116.9s)]
*  So this is one of the reasons why President Trump continues to pull stronger and stronger [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=118.92s)]
*  because Joe Biden exudes weakness on the world stage and he's turning his back on our most [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=124.08s)]
*  important ally in the region, Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=131.86s)]
*  Can you guys do anything about this? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=132.9s)]
*  Because Israel should have one focus, wiping out Hamas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=134.74s)]
*  Any civilian that dies, it's on Hamas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=137.52s)]
*  That's not just me saying that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=140.38s)]
*  Senator Fetterman has said that, who happens to be a Democrat, according to last reports. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=141.9s)]
*  So I'm wondering, why doesn't the president ever say if we leave the remnants of Hamas [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=146.58s)]
*  there, it's going to be just 18 months, if not earlier, before we have another October [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=151.74s)]
*  7th? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=156.34s)]
*  That should be the objective. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=157.34s)]
*  It should be the objective, Brian. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=158.76s)]
*  But you know, this administration, whether it's from the press podium at the White House [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=160.3s)]
*  or the president himself, they have failed to explicitly condemn Hamas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=163.78s)]
*  They have failed to call out the fact that Hamas uses civilian shields and it's a way [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=168.74s)]
*  of their terrorist tactics. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=173.02s)]
*  That's why they need to be defeated. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=174.66s)]
*  That's why it's important for us as the United States to stand with Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=176.3s)]
*  And it was very, it was a very solemn moment this past weekend when you heard at the Holocaust [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=180.34s)]
*  remembrance ceremony at Yad Vashem, Prime Minister Netanyahu said, if Israel has to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  stand alone, they will. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=189.52s)]
*  As the United States of America, we should never allow Israel to stand alone. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  America must stand with Israel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=195.06s)]
*  All three leaders, whether it's Netanyahu, Benny Gantz, or Lupide, they all have no problem [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=197.16s)]
*  with the way their sports are being conducted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=204.2s)]
*  So if they think Netanyahu is the problem, that dog won't hunt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=205.72s)]
*  I want to bring you to the other disturbing thing that's happening, the series of protests [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=209.84s)]
*  in over 27 states on about 80 campuses, and that is the civil unrest that we're seeing, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=213.88s)]
*  the destruction of property and the encampments. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=220.0s)]
*  You brought up a great question. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=222.3s)]
*  Are we actually going to forgive the loans, you told the Secretary of Education, of those [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=223.96s)]
*  who are defiling property and security? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=232.52s)]
*  The students who are being anti-Semitic, do you want to have the taxpayers pay their [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=233.52s)]
*  loans off? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=241.38s)]
*  I believe that students who are breaking the law and are disrupting the educational environment [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  should be held to account. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=250.68s)]
*  Will you commit to ensuring that no student has harassed other students or prevented other [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=252.28s)]
*  students from going to class or broken laws receives any form of student loan forgiveness? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=257.04s)]
*  We are committed to making sure that campuses are safe. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=262.56s)]
*  Is that a good enough answer? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  No, it's not a good enough answer, but great question by Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, Chair [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=267.16s)]
*  of the Education Committee, and it just shows that U.S. taxpayer dollars are being abused [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=272.24s)]
*  these institutions, but paying student loans of these pro-Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=278.56s)]
*  And we should not forgive those student loans. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=283.72s)]
*  We need to defund these universities that are apologists for pro-Hamas, that support [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=285.6s)]
*  these pro-terrorist professors, and turn a blind eye to these terrorist anti-Semitic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=290.72s)]
*  students, some of whom are on student visas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=296.56s)]
*  Those visas need to be revoked. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=298.6s)]
*  That is why we've expanded our house investigation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=300.36s)]
*  So it's going after the appropriations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=303.24s)]
*  That would be the funding going after the visas for the student visas, revoking those [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=305.0s)]
*  immediately, going after the tax exempt status of these universities. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=309.36s)]
*  This is a failure of moral leadership, a failure of moral clarity, and we will continue to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=313.64s)]
*  lead to call this out and hold these schools accountable, which is why this week, for example, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=318.36s)]
*  we have two very important hearings. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=323.56s)]
*  One will have the D.C. mayor, Mayor Bowser, for the failure of her allowing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=325.48s)]
*  She didn't allow the law enforcement to clear the encampment until last night at GW in preparation [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=330.08s)]
*  for the hearing today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=335.76s)]
*  Yeah, you notice the timing, Matt. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=336.76s)]
*  The timing is coincidental, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=338.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=340.96s)]
*  But that shows the importance of these congressional hearings because they will not do the right [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  thing until we hold them accountable. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=347.4s)]
*  And that's why your hearings are so important. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=348.4s)]
*  That's why your majority in the House is so vital. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=349.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4M2GTvA0E&t=357.16s)]
