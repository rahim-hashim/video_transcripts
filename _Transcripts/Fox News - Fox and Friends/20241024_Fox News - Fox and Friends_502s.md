# 'Word salad city': Top Dem torches Kamala Harris' CNN town hall
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I)
*  So here's a look. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=0.0s)]
*  So it was so frustrating watching some of the town hall. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=1.2s)]
*  I had to flip off. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=4.3s)]
*  I had to switch off. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=5.0s)]
*  I didn't say flip off. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=7.3s)]
*  But I would be shenanigans today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=9.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=11.6s)]
*  Here's a look at the questions concise and simple and the answers anything but. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  2022 2023 there were record border crossings. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=18.5s)]
*  You your administration took a number hundreds of executive actions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=22.0s)]
*  It didn't stem the flow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  Numbers kept going up. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Finally in 2024 just in June three weeks before the last the first presidential debate with Joe Biden you institute executive actions that had a dramatic impact really shut down people crossing over. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=30.1s)]
*  Why didn't your administration do that in 2022 2023? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=43.6s)]
*  First of all, you're exactly right Anderson. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=47.6s)]
*  And as of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  In fact, the numbers I saw most recently illegal immigration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=53.8s)]
*  It was that easy with that executive action. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=57.4s)]
*  Why not do it in 2022 2023? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=59.4s)]
*  Because we were working with Congress and hoping that actually we could have a long-term fix to the problem instead of a short-term fix. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  You couldn't have done one in the both of the same time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=67.4s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=69.4s)]
*  We have to understand that ultimately this problem is going to be fixed through congressional action. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=70.5s)]
*  Under Donald Trump you criticized the wall more than 50 times. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=77.0s)]
*  You called it stupid useless and a medieval vanity project. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=80.3s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=84.9s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=86.7s)]
*  So remember Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=90.4s)]
*  Come on, they didn't. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  How much of that wall did he build? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=96.7s)]
*  I think the last number I saw is about 2%. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=98.5s)]
*  To fix the problem you're doing this compromise bill. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=100.9s)]
*  It does call for 650 million dollars that was earmarked under Trump to actually still go to build the wall. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm not afraid of good ideas where they occur. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  You don't think it's stupid anymore. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  I think what he did and how he did it did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=113.7s)]
*  I just talked about that wall, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=120.5s)]
*  We just talked about it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=122.5s)]
*  He didn't actually do much of anything. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=123.3s)]
*  But you do want to build some wall. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=125.7s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=128.3s)]
*  You know, I gotta give him so much credit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=130.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=132.7s)]
*  Haley Jackson too yesterday. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=133.2s)]
*  These aren't complex questions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=134.7s)]
*  They're the questions everybody has. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=136.3s)]
*  She has not been forced to answer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=137.8s)]
*  She got the nomination in July. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=139.3s)]
*  She hijacked it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=140.7s)]
*  And here we are in October. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=142.10000000000002s)]
*  She's finally getting just normal questions in a follow-up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=143.9s)]
*  She has no answer. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  Anderson asked her why didn't she do what she promised as a vice president? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=148.3s)]
*  And this is her answer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=152.3s)]
*  There was a lot done, but there's more to do. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=153.3s)]
*  I'm pointing out things that need to be done that haven't been done, but need to be done. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=161.3s)]
*  Now that makes sense. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=161.8s)]
*  I think she read it back. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  Now I get it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=163.9s)]
*  There were some direct questions that we all want the answers to. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  Particularly undecided voters want the answers to. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=169.6s)]
*  So frustrating to watch. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  One of... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  I read... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not. I'm not frustrated. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  I read this morning that apparently she was asked a pretty simple question, and she gave [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  a seven-minute answer that didn't actually answer the question. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  What is she? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=183.0s)]
*  Here is Barack Obama's former advisor, David Axelrod, over on CNN with his assessment of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=184.0s)]
*  her performance. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  It was not good. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  I think it was a mixed night, okay? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  I think she was very strong coming out of the gate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=198.1s)]
*  She was very strong on, as she has been, on abortion rights, because she feels passionately [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=200.6s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=206.2s)]
*  She could be clinical on some of these economic issues. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=207.2s)]
*  She was great on the long-term care for the elderly. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=210.4s)]
*  The things that would concern me is when she doesn't want to answer a question, her habit [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=215.5s)]
*  is to kind of go to word salad city. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=220.6s)]
*  And she did that on a couple of answers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=224.0s)]
*  One was on Israel. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=225.8s)]
*  And when Anderson asked a direct question, would you be stronger in Israel than Trump? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=226.8s)]
*  And there was a seven-minute answer, but none of it related to the question he was asking. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=231.3s)]
*  I'll tell you something. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=236.8s)]
*  The analysis that one of the Obama bros is giving is essentially reflecting what the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=238.4s)]
*  former president of the United States, President Barack Obama feels, and David Plouffe, who's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  now running Kamala Harris' campaign. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=249.8s)]
*  I owe them a lot of credit from my childhood teaching me how to do community organizing, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=252.4s)]
*  knock on doors, communicate with. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=256.6s)]
*  She has some of the best tacticians on her campaign. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  The problem is they have a terrible candidate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=262.54s)]
*  They were used to dealing with Barack Obama, who can go out there and speak and communicate [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=264.5s)]
*  to the American people, who wanted the moderates to come and vote for him, who was called the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=268.6s)]
*  deporter in chief. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  And now you have a candidate that has had years to craft some sort of message, and she [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  has nothing? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=279.8s)]
*  Nothing at all for the American people? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=281.38s)]
*  I mean, good luck. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  No, this is why the answer is Donald Trump is unelectable, he's unhinged, he's too old. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=285.38s)]
*  That is why she's going to be at the ellipse. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=290.18s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  That's what she's going to say. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  Don't vote for me, just don't vote for him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=294.3s)]
*  Vote for me because you don't want to vote for him. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=296.44s)]
*  And that's pretty sad when they look around with their communications experts and say, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=298.36s)]
*  judging by your performance, we have to make him unelectable because we can't make you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  electable. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=307.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=308.1s)]
*  Running for president would be very difficult, right? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=309.32s)]
*  You're asked questions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  You have to think very quickly. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=313.34s)]
*  Every answer could kill you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  So you have to be smart about it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  But when it's over and over and over, that whole town hall, she wasn't answering any [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  questions. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  It makes me wonder, is she prepared for this? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  Does she have a plan? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=327.28s)]
*  Or is she saying, I'm a thinker, I can't answer this right now, because she needs to go backstage [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  and ask her people what to say? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7uor8wg1I&t=333.64s)]
