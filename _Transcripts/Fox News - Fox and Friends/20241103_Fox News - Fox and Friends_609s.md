# 'Fox & Friends': Kamala Harris mocked for 'rip-off' of Trump SNL skit
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE)
*  So it is 6.01 here in New York City, a special edition of Fox and Friends on this Sunday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=0.0s)]
*  We are less than 48 hours away for Election Day and both campaigns are back on the trail [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=9.0s)]
*  today making their final push to the American voters. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=14.42s)]
*  It's one appearance for the Vice President though. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=17.96s)]
*  Trump and Harris still sit neck and neck in one of the tightest races for the White House [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=20.16s)]
*  that we have ever seen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=24.5s)]
*  Most of yesterday speaking to voters in key battleground states. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=26.08s)]
*  And today both candidates are keeping their focus on the swing states. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to make stops in Pennsylvania, North Carolina [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  and Georgia while Vice President Harris has a rally planned in Michigan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  Plus last night Harris was here in New York City with an appearance on Saturday Night Live. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=43.32s)]
*  I wish I could talk to someone who's been in my shoes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=50.36s)]
*  You know, a black South Asian woman running for president, preferably from the Bay Area. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=53.08s)]
*  You and me both, sister. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=70.16s)]
*  It is nice to see you, Kamala. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=72.16s)]
*  It is nice to see you, Kamala. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=74.88s)]
*  And I'm just here to remind you, you got this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=76.88s)]
*  Because you can do something your opponent cannot do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=80.64s)]
*  You can open doors. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  I see what you did there, like to a garbage truck, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't really laugh like that, do I? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=101.44s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's about two and a half minutes long. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=105.48s)]
*  It is rare. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=108.48s)]
*  We've seen politicians go on Saturday Night Live before, but never in the final hours like this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=109.64s)]
*  So it was to campaign it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=116.2s)]
*  They're trying to get her elected. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=118.28s)]
*  She was taking a risk, though, by doing a live thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=119.48s)]
*  Ultimately, it wasn't cringy, but it wasn't comedy gold. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=122.92s)]
*  But Steve, this is not a risk. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=126.84s)]
*  I mean, all she had to do was stare at herself. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=128.24s)]
*  Ultimately, that's right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=130.52s)]
*  Ultimately, all they're doing is they just wanted some little clips, some little snippets that they could blast out on their website. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=133.4s)]
*  And they did that, the Kamala Harris team. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=140.4s)]
*  And now people are circulating it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  And the whole idea is the low propensity younger voter. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, politicians have been on SNL in the past. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  In fact, Donald Trump has been on. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=151.44000000000003s)]
*  He was on in 2015 as a candidate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=152.8s)]
*  He did a whole show. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and then he was also on in 2004. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  But Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, John McCain, they also played themselves. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  They were running. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, the FCC, the Republican on the FCC, Brendan Carr said this is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's equal time rule. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  And he said the purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of bias and partisan conduct. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  I just find it interesting because we were told by the vice president's staff that she wasn't able to fly last minute to do interviews when it came down to the Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=179.68s)]
*  Do we know if they asked Donald Trump to be on as well? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=191.16s)]
*  That's key. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=193.24s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  All right, we'll find out shortly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=195.12s)]
*  But the thing is also, what's with the writers? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=196.6s)]
*  Can you come up with something new? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=199.16s)]
*  2015, Donald Trump, Jimmy Fallon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=200.96s)]
*  Look. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=203.96s)]
*  Wow, I look fantastic. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  No, we look fantastic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=210.6s)]
*  And I mean really fantastic. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=222.16s)]
*  All right, me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=225.4s)]
*  We've got a big interview with Jimmy Fallon coming up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=226.32s)]
*  Well, let's be honest, Fallon's a lightweight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  No way he deserves to interview me. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=232.24s)]
*  The only one qualified to interview me is me. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=235.84s)]
*  Me interviewing me, that's what I call a great idea. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=240.6s)]
*  And it was such a great idea to do that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=253.92s)]
*  The same thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=256.44s)]
*  Saturday Night Live essentially did this exactly the same thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=256.92s)]
*  So it's. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=261.12s)]
*  So this podcast through Stephen Miller writes this on the Daily Mail. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=262.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris, tempting fate by going SNL means there's a real possibility. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=266.4s)]
*  We get Maya Rudolph doing Hallelujah on a piano next week [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=270.20000000000005s)]
*  because remember when they depicted Hillary Clinton, she was funny at a bar. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=274.04s)]
*  She lost. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=279.24s)]
*  And then the woman that played her, whose name alludes me. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=280.48s)]
*  Yeah, Kate McKinnon. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=284.44s)]
*  She ends up singing Hallelujah the next week. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  This is after the whole nation or a portion of the nation mourned [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  that Donald Trump won the election with a lot of tears. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=291.36s)]
*  Right. Makes us realize, my gosh, you're right, Brian. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=293.92s)]
*  Next week and hopefully we will know who wins. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=296.44s)]
*  Let's hope on Wednesday, Tuesday night. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=299.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, you have any next weekend we will have. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=301.32s)]
*  We will know who the next president will be. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=304.36s)]
*  Right. And we'll find out if it is the SNL will be the at the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=306.12s)]
*  sports with the Madden cover that happens to every superstar. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=309.2s)]
*  You put on the Madden, he gets hurt the next year. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=312.32s)]
*  We'll see if SNL is a hex. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=314.52s)]
*  Well, you know what? She was right across the street. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=316.4s)]
*  It's too bad she didn't drop by. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=318.92s)]
*  Our doors always open. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=320.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, this morning we have our live team coverage from the campaign trail. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=322.4s)]
*  All right. Let's see who's up with us. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=327.04s)]
*  Jackie Heinrich is live in Michigan screened left ahead of Harris's rally [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=329.16s)]
*  at Michigan State University. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=333.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, Carly Schimke's screen center is catching up. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=335.2s)]
*  Trump supporters already lining up outside a rally in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=338.96s)]
*  But first, let's get to Aisha Hosni, who is in North Carolina [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=343.4s)]
*  before Trump rallies in the Tar Heel State as a part of his battleground blitz. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=347.4s)]
*  Hey, Aisha. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=351.64s)]
*  Hey, good morning to you all. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=354.0s)]
*  The former president is going to be nonstop for the next 48 hours. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=355.6s)]
*  He's hitting up about seven rallies across four different battleground states. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  And the ticket isn't just going after those swing states. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=364.36s)]
*  They're also trying to expand the map in these final hours by hitting those [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  blue leaning states, including, as you mentioned, Virginia last night. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=371.44s)]
*  Trump spoke to a huge crowd in Salem. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=375.68s)]
*  That's a state that he thinks that he can swing this year. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  And running mate JD Vance will also be in New Hampshire today, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  along with Don Jr. Now, you can hear in Trump's final pitch here, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=385.32000000000005s)]
*  he is messaging to suburban female voters. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=389.12s)]
*  He's hoping the economy and border security will sway female voters. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=392.24s)]
*  If they don't have me, they got millions of people [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=398.56s)]
*  pouring through and coming up to the suburbs. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=400.92s)]
*  They say the suburban women. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=403.48s)]
*  Well, the suburbs are under attack right now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  When you're home in your house alone [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=409.0s)]
*  and you have this monster that got out of prison, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=412.16s)]
*  he's got, you know, six charges of murdering six different people. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=414.96s)]
*  I think you'd rather have Trump. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=420.0s)]
*  So all of this comes as a new Des Moines register poll comes out last night [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  showing that Harris is beating Trump by three points in Iowa. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, that sent shockwaves across the political spectrum. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=432.2s)]
*  I've been talking with the campaign last night, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=435.2s)]
*  and they're telling me that this poll is an outlier. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=437.32s)]
*  They say that while it might be close in those battleground states, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=440.2s)]
*  it is not close at all in Iowa. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=443.2s)]
*  They're even questioning the timing of this release right before all of the Sunday [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  shows that everybody has to talk about it today. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  The campaign pointing to another poll instead, writing this, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=451.88s)]
*  the Emerson College poll released today far more closely reflects the state of the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=455.68s)]
*  actual Iowa electorate and does so with far more transparency in their methodology. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=460.2s)]
*  That one actually has Trump up by 10 points again. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=465.4s)]
*  That's in Iowa. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=468.88s)]
*  So they are pushing back very hard, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=470.44s)]
*  trying to get ahead of this before all those Sunday shows today. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=473.0s)]
*  Back to you guys. Indeed. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=475.68s)]
*  And we're one of the Sunday shows today. Thank you very much. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=476.96s)]
*  Des Moines, Iowa poll. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=479.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. The Des Moines, Iowa register poll does have Kamala leading by [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=480.96s)]
*  a few points, but the lady who the pollster was dead wrong. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=484.96s)]
*  Yes, she was dead wrong in the GOP caucus. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=488.72s)]
*  She had Nikki Haley beating Ron DeSantis, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=491.52s)]
*  and she didn't have Donald Trump up as much as he was. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=494.12s)]
*  But we'll see the Des Moines register is on the clock. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=497.32s)]
*  So if this ends up being inaccurate, who's ever going to look at that poll again? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=499.4s)]
*  But he's 10 points up in Emerson. Right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=503.64s)]
*  10 points in Emerson at the same time period. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=506.0s)]
*  Right. And we're hearing from a number of poll pollsters, though, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=508.64s)]
*  who are critical of the polls themselves because there's this thing called hurting [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=512.56s)]
*  that a lot of pollsters are apparently doing this particular [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=517.4s)]
*  this particular cycle. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=521.76s)]
*  And what it essentially does is it makes it look like it is so close [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=523.12s)]
*  it could go either way so that the pollsters don't look bad. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=528.88s)]
*  Ultimately, on Wednesday morning, we hope that's when we know the new president. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  Both sides are showing a degree of confidence that they have this thing, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=536.76s)]
*  even though in all seven battleground states, it's within the margin of error. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=540.28s)]
*  They say on average, the the state by state polls are off three point four percent. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=543.56s)]
*  Every single one of these polls are inside that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=549.0s)]
*  You still have half of the voters that still haven't voted. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=552.04s)]
*  It's not election day yet. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=555.08s)]
*  So it's still anybody's game. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  70 million, 80 to 90 million, I thought, could be could be Election Day. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=557.6s)]
*  And that's why you have to just assume your vote could be the deciding vote. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=562.16s)]
*  You need to go and vote and wear a sticker like that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=565.88s)]
*  Right. You know, when I was my wife and I were voting yesterday, it dawned on me [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=568.04s)]
*  the way America is, you know, heading toward early voting this time. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=573.28s)]
*  Wouldn't it be great if everybody has a couple of weeks, a month before the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  election day, you can, you know, go do your early voting. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=582.88s)]
*  And then on Election Day, they actually just count it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=585.6s)]
*  And that way they've got the number at the, you know, at the stroke of what every [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  time the polls close, they go, OK, let's push the button. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=592.36s)]
*  That's the way it was when we were growing up. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=594.72s)]
*  It was simpler. Yeah, it was. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6J-HDSqgnE&t=596.6s)]
