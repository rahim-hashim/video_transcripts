# Kevin O’Leary: Tech CEOs ‘sucking up’ to Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM)
*  Moving on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the latest billionaire CEO to meet with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump also recently met with the CEOs of tik-tok Netflix meta Apple and Google and Mark Zuckerberg and others [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=8.3s)]
*  Have even made massive donations to his inaugural fund here to discuss is O'Leary [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Ventures chairman, mr. Wonderful Kevin O'Leary. Good morning, Kevin [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Great to be here. Thank you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  So a few hours after Donald Trump met with Jeff Bezos, he posted on truth social [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=27.2s)]
*  Everybody wants to be my friend. Do you think Jeff Bezos really wants to be Donald Trump's friend? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=33.14s)]
*  He certainly wants to be in sync with what Trump is thinking because Trump by every measure has a majority [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=39.8s)]
*  Mandates and he's going to rule supreme for at least two years until the midterms and that includes tech that includes social media [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Which you've been talking about this morning and all of these leaders whether they like him or not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=53.38s)]
*  Are gonna suck up to him and that's exactly what they're doing because to be cut out of the circle of friendship [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=58.86000000000001s)]
*  Is a diminished position if you're a technology leader and you want to be in that circle of friendship with Trump right now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=64.54s)]
*  Love him or hate him and a lot of these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=70.98s)]
*  CEOs bashed him pretty hard in his first mandate [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=73.42s)]
*  So they've got a lot of sucking up to do and it feels new were these CEOs not sucking up to Joe Biden [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=76.84s)]
*  Biden really didn't take a position on tech his [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=86.76s)]
*  Administrators did they beat it up pretty badly and they were pretty [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  Not in support of innovation they preferred regulation and that's obvious because it's history you don't have to bait it anymore [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  That was con and the rest of them but with with Trump it seems more that the idea and this really stems from something [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  Doug Burgum said recently the czar of energy, but it extends to every sector [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  He said he would rather innovate than regulate and that gives the new tonality to the Trump administration [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=115.88s)]
*  I think it's a good thing. I think America has always innovated its way out of trouble [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=122.58s)]
*  We don't need to regular regulate ourselves into it and that's what's happening now. We don't want to diminish our competition [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=126.36s)]
*  And as we see these CEOs, I spent a lot of time in West Palm Beach these days just watching these [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=132.64s)]
*  Motorcades go across the causeway. How would you rate the level of jealousy that these CEOs have of Elon Musk? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=139.8s)]
*  Well must bring something to the table that many of them don't have [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=149.88s)]
*  They're all they've all been very successful [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=155.48s)]
*  But Elon Musk is an extraordinary individual when it comes to executional skills [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=158.2s)]
*  So when you hear him say he's going to implement cost savings in government [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=162.56s)]
*  It's hard to find a place where he hasn't chosen a mandate and been successful at it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=167.56s)]
*  So I'm very interested in hearing what his recommendations would be [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=172.0s)]
*  About cutting costs. There's a lot of fat in government. Everybody knows that whether you're a Democrat or Republican [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  So this is a very interesting role. He's taken on it's and I think it's going to yield some fruit [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=181.12s)]
*  And I think some of these recommendations are going to be acknowledged by the president who will give him [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=187.48s)]
*  Executional ability to implement them. So I don't see anything wrong here [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't care what side of the fence you're on red or blue or independent [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=197.16s)]
*  You know government is dripping with fat and it's your tax money funding it and we hear all these Democrats now talking about how [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk is a billionaire who is bending the ear of Donald Trump [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=208.56s)]
*  He did get Trump to go to a SpaceX launch and support him there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=212.2s)]
*  But he still has not convinced Trump to get up early every day and post on X [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=216.28s)]
*  That could come though at some point. Thank you, Kevin O'Leary [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZXHPro4tM&t=222.16s)]
