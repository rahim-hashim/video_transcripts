# Pete Hegseth vows to be a 'change agent' in opening statement
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E)
*  Here we go. This morning's Senate confirmation hearings for President-elect Trump's Cabinet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=0.0s)]
*  begin. Up first, arguably the most important position, defense secretary. Nominee Pete [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=4.84s)]
*  Hegseth front and center. In his opening statement obtained by Axios, we'll share it with you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=10.52s)]
*  now. It is true, I don't have a similar biography, defense secretaries of the last 30 years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=15.76s)]
*  But as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=21.12s)]
*  with supposedly the right credentials, whether they are retired four-star generals, academics [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=26.24s)]
*  or defense contract executives. And where has it gotten us? He believes, and I humbly [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  agree that it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm. A change agent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Though Democrats are expected to grill Pete, he's getting huge support from fellow veterans, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=42.84s)]
*  including hundreds in D.C. today. They're there on their own volition. Not because Pete [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=47.16s)]
*  asked him to, but he's obviously honored. Trump's senior advisor, Jason Miller, joins us today. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=52.28s)]
*  Jason, what is Pete's greatest challenge today when he sits down for, I don't know, three [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  or four hours? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=64.28s)]
*  Well, I don't see it so much of a challenge. I think it's an opportunity to talk about [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=65.28s)]
*  restoring that warrior ethos, that warrior spirit, back into the military. And this was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=69.68s)]
*  a mandate that President Trump ran and won on and received 77 million votes, 312 electoral [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=74.4s)]
*  votes and the majority of the popular vote. And the fact that we have to get our military [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  focused back on defending this country. There was a study that came out, Brian, in July [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  from the Commission on National Defense Strategy that said the United States is not prepared [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=91.04s)]
*  for a major conflict right now. That's what's happened over these last four years under [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden. We have to get our military away from the woke nonsense, away from playing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=99.2s)]
*  politics and back to focused on defending our country and defending Americans. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  So Jason, I know for a fact how much great work you did behind the scenes with all the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=107.96s)]
*  candidates and with President Trump and Vice President Vance when he was a nominee to get [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=112.32s)]
*  them ready for debates. So when they go after Pete personally, which has been all over the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=117.6s)]
*  news, what's the best strategy? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=123.8s)]
*  Well, I think Pete Hegseth is going to kill him with kindness. You see Pete Hegseth, he's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=126.44s)]
*  a very smart, very telegenic, very presentable leader. And this is someone who graduated [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  from Princeton and from Harvard. This is someone who has served on the battlefield, who knows [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=136.08s)]
*  what it's like to be shot at, who's led troops in battle. This is the type of leader that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=140.12s)]
*  we need ahead. The Department of Defense. We've tried all the so-called experts for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=144.68s)]
*  years and for decades. Now we have someone who's actually been in the line of fire. And [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  I think that's the type of perspective we had. Keep in mind, under President Trump during [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=153.96s)]
*  those first four years, we had no new wars. And that was because we had deterrence, we [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  had peace through strength. And with Pete Hegseth at the helm, we're going to get back to that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=162.84s)]
*  And just lastly, real quick, do you admit in the past I haven't been perfect, like almost [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=168.44000000000003s)]
*  every one of you who are asking me these questions today? Or do you just ignore it, parry, and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  refocus? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=179.96s)]
*  Pete's going to be completely honest. He'll be upfront. And in his one-on-one meetings [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=180.96s)]
*  that he has had, he's really dazzled, I would say most of the senators that he's met with, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  his grasp of the issues, his knowledge of the Department of Defense, his readiness to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=190.84s)]
*  step in and lead. There's a reason, Brian, where right now, as of this moment, we have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=195.08s)]
*  dozens of veterans, Gold Star family members, supporters of Pete's, who are camped outside [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=199.24s)]
*  with the Dirksen Senate office building, ready to support him in that committee meeting today. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=204.16s)]
*  Additionally, we have dozens of veterans who will be marching up from the Vietnam memorial [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=208.88s)]
*  to support Pete as well. That's because people believe in Pete Hegseth, they believe in President [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=212.32s)]
*  Trump. Let's get the woke out of the military and get back to the warrior spirit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=216.88s)]
*  And Jason, that's totally a surprise to Pete. He has nothing to do with organizing that, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=220.64s)]
*  but he's truly honored. I know that firsthand. And lastly, when you look at the other nominees, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=224.64s)]
*  you've got 14 of 16, almost everyone got dates. Who's the one you're most worried about, concerned [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=229.28s)]
*  with, or has got the most ground to make up in the hearings? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=236.0s)]
*  I'm not concerned about any of President Trump's nominees. These are all excellent choices, and I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=241.04s)]
*  think that they're going to do very well when they get to their hearings. And of course, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=245.44s)]
*  the Democrats are going to try to obstruct or try to come up with any possible delays that they can. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=248.56s)]
*  But when you look at the pace that President Trump's picks are on right now, we're about three [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=252.8s)]
*  times ahead of the pace for having his nominees confirmed by the full Senate at the end of January. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=257.2s)]
*  There are about three that were confirmed by the end of January in 2017, will be about nine or ten [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=262.88s)]
*  by the end of January this year. And really, I think that's a testament to President Trump knowing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=267.68s)]
*  exactly who he wanted to pick, what they stood for, and what his mandate is to bring change to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=272.56s)]
*  this country. Jason, great job. I know you get in the inner sanctum on all this, so your insight's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=277.36s)]
*  great. Thank you, Jason Miller. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Yc9tj7d2E&t=282.64s)]
