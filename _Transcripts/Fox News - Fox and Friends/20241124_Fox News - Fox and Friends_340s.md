# Axios co-founders make interesting comparison to Trump's diverse coalition
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k)
*  The president-elect is filling his cabinet in near record time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a very stark difference from what happened last time when he was set to take office. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is in the nation's Capitol with more on Trump's new team. Madeline. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=8.24s)]
*  Hi guys, good morning. President-elect Trump rounded out the top 15 positions within his cabinet. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=12.64s)]
*  With this announcement last night, he chose former White House aide Brooke Rollins to lead [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=17.76s)]
*  the Department of Agriculture. In a post on X, Rollins wrote, in part, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  It will be the honor of my life to fight for America's farmers and our nation's agricultural [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=26.88s)]
*  communities. This is big stuff for a small town, AG girl from Glen Rose, Texas. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=31.68s)]
*  As a refresher, some of Trump's other high-profile nominees include Senator Marco Rubio for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=37.44s)]
*  Secretary of State, veteran and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=42.56s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services, Scott Besson for Treasury Secretary, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=48.16s)]
*  and former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi for AG. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=53.36s)]
*  Moving forward to the confirmation process on Capitol Hill, the appropriate Senate committees [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=56.88s)]
*  will review the backgrounds of the candidates, and generally, the committees will have hearings on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=61.6s)]
*  the nominations where the nominees will testify. The committees will then vote on whether to send [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=66.0s)]
*  the nomination to the full Senate. A nominee needs a simple majority of the senators who are present [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=70.72s)]
*  and are voting in order to be confirmed. Some of Trump's choices are expected to be highly [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=76.0s)]
*  scrutinized. Still, rejections are rare. The last major cabinet rejection was in 1989. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=81.68s)]
*  Former President George H.W. Bush's nominee for Defense Secretary John Tower [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  fell in the Senate by a 47 to 53 vote. Charlie, Rachel, and Brian. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=92.72000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Madeline. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Madeline. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  So the latest pick, you guys, was Brooke Rollins as Agriculture Secretary. But yeah, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=100.72s)]
*  it's filling out really quickly. And Axios is bringing up a really interesting point about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=105.92000000000002s)]
*  these picks. They're saying that these picks actually resemble more of like a European-style [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=109.52s)]
*  coalition government. Here's a headline from that piece called, the title of the piece is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=115.44s)]
*  Behind the Curtain, Trump's Liberal Cabinet. I don't know if that's exactly accurate, but here's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=120.72s)]
*  what they say. They say, lost in the noise of Trump's most controversial picks is the simple, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=126.88s)]
*  undebatable fact that this might be the most ideologically diverse cabinet of modern times. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=132.0s)]
*  As Axios's Zachary Basu told you, Trump's cabinet increasingly resembles a European-style [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=137.36s)]
*  coalition government, staffed with a dizzying array of ideological rivals united for now by [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  grand mega vision. It's Trump's team of ideological rivals. The team represents the Trump worldview, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=149.52s)]
*  traditional conservatism is dead, and its biggest lifelong advocates have been neutered [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=156.08s)]
*  to the point of irrelevance. I'm not sure if I agree with that last line, guys, but [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=161.84s)]
*  there is a lot of crossover here. And it's not stark. It's not like he has, here's a liberal, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=166.64s)]
*  here's a conservative. It's that these views are evolving just like Donald Trump has remade the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=171.27999999999997s)]
*  party. A lot of us have gotten to think differently about a lot of different subjects. So somebody [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  like myself, I'm now like on the pro-peace side of things. I agree with RFK, for example, on food [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=182.48s)]
*  and his approach to pharma and his skepticism of pharma and the relationship between government [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  and many of these corporations and corporate interests. But at the same time, I vehemently [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=196.56s)]
*  disagree with RFK Jr. on say abortion. And I think that kind of overlap is happening all over the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=201.68s)]
*  place with so many of these picks. Well, I think the, and the piece is emphasizing like ideologically [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  or political diversity and difference. And I think that's true. But again, I look at the wall, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  I look at the nominees and I just see a lot of people who are clearly independent thinkers, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=220.08s)]
*  people who are not afraid to speak their mind, to have an independent thought, maybe to buck the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=225.2s)]
*  trend. And I just think that's very good. I think America would look at this wall and see [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  the independence of thought more than they would see, you know, whatever the team of rivals or, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=235.28s)]
*  you know, can this hold together and all that. I just think they're seeing people who aren't afraid [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  to question the status quo, maybe to upend the status quo. Maybe they don't all agree. But that's, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  that's what the election was about to me. I mean, that's, you know, Joe Rogan kind of fits in that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=253.28s)]
*  these are all people who would be interesting on Joe Rogan because they're willing to speak their [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=257.36s)]
*  minds. And that says something about where America is right now. And many of them have been on Joe [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=261.12s)]
*  Rogan. It's interesting, you know, and I think that what it points out, going back for eight [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=266.88s)]
*  years now, Donald Trump has never been afraid to talk to anybody or listen to anybody. He's always [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=273.76s)]
*  trying to get smart people's opinions on different things. And one of the things that he talks about [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  is, you know, he wants to put RFK Jr. in charge of health issues and food issues, but he's not [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  going to let him touch the oil drilling operation. He's right next to Doug Burgum on our wall. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=292.32s)]
*  And Trump's like, I'm okay with those two guys right next to each other because I like it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  He's not going to let RFK make any decisions about getting the liquid gold out of the ground [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=302.0s)]
*  and drilling. But let's hope that he works closely with other parts of the administration. So, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=307.04s)]
*  for example, we just talked about Brook Rollins. Hopefully RFK and Brook Rollins share, you know, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=313.04s)]
*  our working hand and glove on some of these agricultural issues because obviously so much [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=319.6s)]
*  of our food supply, I think, has been hurt by the sort of corporate industry, industrial way of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=324.48s)]
*  looking at things and small farms have been hurt in the process. So I'm hoping that that's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=332.8s)]
*  something that we can see some crossover there as well. Okay. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXPHDoOc7k&t=337.12s)]
