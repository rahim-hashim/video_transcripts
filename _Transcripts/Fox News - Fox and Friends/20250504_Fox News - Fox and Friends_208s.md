# Report: Staffers are worried about Fetterman
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng)
*  A new expose raising eyebrows about Democratic Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=0.0s)]
*  According to his staff, Fetterman was avoiding the regular checkups advised by his doctors. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  He drove his car so recklessly that staff refused to ride with him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=10.76s)]
*  He also bought a gun. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=16.36s)]
*  Fetterman was isolated, had damaged personal relationships, and was shedding staff. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=17.96s)]
*  And they expect more staffers to depart. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  So what gives with the takedown? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=26.52s)]
*  Maybe our next guest knows. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=28.56s)]
*  She's been covering Fetterman from day one. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=30.16s)]
*  Pittsburgh based columnist Selena Zito joining us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=32.6s)]
*  My friend, listen, this sounds like somebody has it out for this guy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  And I'm just curious, is it because he's trending more centrist or [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=39.96s)]
*  is there more to it than that? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=44.16s)]
*  Well, I suspect, I mean, I'm not inside the head of the staffers that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=47.08s)]
*  were participated in this story. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=52.56s)]
*  But I think that these staffers didn't have a fundamental understanding of who [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=55.0s)]
*  John Fetterman was before he had his stroke and was recovering from that and his depression. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=59.24s)]
*  And leading up to 2022, Fetterman has always been a very independent elected official, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=65.64s)]
*  whether he was mayor or lieutenant governor of the state. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=73.76s)]
*  He's never really been the darling of his party. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=77.92s)]
*  If I remember correctly, his party's never even endorsed him when he's run for [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=80.88s)]
*  office. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=84.84s)]
*  The only time I ever saw John Fetterman, not himself, was in 2022 when he was running. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  And he was obviously recovering from a stroke and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=92.84s)]
*  to his own admission recovering from depression. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=97.44s)]
*  But if they're shocked and surprised by who he is today, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  then they never really knew the real John Fetterman. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=104.56s)]
*  This is a guy who has emerged after leaving Walder Reed for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=108.4s)]
*  treatment as himself. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=113.12s)]
*  This is who he's always been. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  He's never been the darling of the Democrats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  He's always been his own person. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=120.48s)]
*  And I think they're the ones that are stunned by it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=122.68s)]
*  And I think it's interesting that they decide to do a story about him and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=127.44s)]
*  disparage him in the way that they did in this story. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, if you haven't had a chance to see it, folks at home, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  let me share the headline. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=138.4s)]
*  This, of course, is from New York Magazine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=139.28s)]
*  It reads, all by himself. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=141.72s)]
*  John Fetterman insists he's in good health, but staffers past and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=144.08s)]
*  present say they no longer recognize the man they once knew. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  15 seconds to go, Selena, does this amount to anything or [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=153.32s)]
*  is this much ado about nothing? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=157.56s)]
*  This is very DC and not very Pennsylvania. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=160.44s)]
*  He enjoys a robust support and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=165.92s)]
*  approval rating among Democrats and Republicans in the state. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=168.84s)]
*  And so I think this is a DC thing and not a Pennsylvania thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=173.24s)]
*  I think for people who don't know that state the way you do, the way I do, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=177.4s)]
*  there's an awful lot of red in that state. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=182.6s)]
*  It's not as bluish as some people like to make it out. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=184.48s)]
*  I think it's a fairly balanced state. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=188.4s)]
*  John Fetterman enjoys a great deal of support among red and blue voters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=189.92s)]
*  Selena Zeta, great to see you, my friend. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=194.84s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HByHyDSZVng&t=196.88s)]
