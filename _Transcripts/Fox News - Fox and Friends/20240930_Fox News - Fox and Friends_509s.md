# Asheville resident details 'apocalyptic' aftermath of Hurricane Helene
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg)
*  And we start this hour with that Fox weather alert. Nearly 100 people are known to be dead as Helene has devastated the southeast in the mid Atlantic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=0.0s)]
*  Millions continue to wake up without power as rescue operations are underway across the region. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=10.3s)]
*  Fox weather correspondent Robin Ray is live in Asheville, North Carolina as the sun comes up. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=16.0s)]
*  Robert, what are you seeing? Are the cleanup crews starting to arrive? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=22.5s)]
*  Yeah, good morning to you. Indeed, we will begin to see aid and cleanup begin as the sun has come up here and Lloyd Alford behind the lens as I'm walking through the mud as the water recedes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=27.3s)]
*  Lloyd, train your lens over there and show them some of the debris that has come in from this flash flooding scenario in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene that came in the impacts on Friday morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=40.8s)]
*  And you see in the distance water and tractor trailers overturned. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=53.3s)]
*  Ninety nine people across multiple states have lost their lives, nearly 40 in the state of North Carolina. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  And as I stand here and speak to you this morning, there are many people that are still out of communication zones. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  Cell service is minimal and we can see the impacts from the air and the ground in some of the video that we're potentially looking at right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=70.7s)]
*  Power is a major issue. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=80.3s)]
*  Fuel is an issue. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=82.2s)]
*  There is little or no resources for food and water and aid is trying to make its way in. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  We are told there are over 2000 federal government employees on the ground here and that there is over 5000 National Guard troops that have been called in to try and help search and rescue is still active here today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=90.3s)]
*  As many people in some of these towns that are up in the hills are cut off because of lack of communication. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=103.2s)]
*  And so if there's missing people, we hope that that is the scenario that they just have not been able to get cell phone and communication out. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=109.9s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I got a text from someone whose daughter lives here in the hills and he just heard from her this morning. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=117.0s)]
*  And so we know that President Biden and Kamala Harris, vice president, will be here at some point later this week. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=124.4s)]
*  Donald Trump will be in Valdosta visiting that devastated town. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  And so we know that there are over 1000 people on the ground here trying to assist as far as state, local and federal government. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=136.1s)]
*  And on top of that, unfortunately, we have nearly 2 million customers still without power in multiple states from Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=142.2s)]
*  This is an epic disaster that will likely cost over 100 billion dollars as Helene has ravaged many people and uprooted lives and taken lives. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=163.4s)]
*  So, Robert, you know, millions of Americans live along disaster prone areas like the coast, along the Atlantic Ocean and along the Gulf Coast. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=164.9s)]
*  And they expect this kind of stuff when a hurricane comes ashore. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=174.3s)]
*  But you're in North Carolina. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they're not only suffering from unimaginable, as Roy Cooper, the governor there, said, damage and destruction from the water and the flooding, but also mudslides. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=179.9s)]
*  Nobody saw that coming. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=190.8s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons that a lot of the roads, 200 roads have been impacted and it slowed down the response. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=192.1s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=199.6s)]
*  And, you know, look, it was forecasted that we would get this kind of impact. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=201.0s)]
*  But the problem is, is that this hasn't occurred in well over 100 years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=204.9s)]
*  And so, you know, the human mind is short, right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=209.7s)]
*  In memory and the topography here, you don't know where this water is coming from, per se, unfortunately. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=212.7s)]
*  And when that much water falls from the sky nearly three feet in some spots and makes its way into the river system and then the hills here, you don't know whether it's coming in and ruining your business and your home. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=219.8s)]
*  And so I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from Helene. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  Certainly, this needs to be looked at. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  And I mean, you know, let's listen, if we can, just real quick to one gentleman's description of what is going on here on the ground. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=238.4s)]
*  I just want you to hear him and not me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=247.2s)]
*  It's been an incredibly apocalyptic weekend for all of us here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  Almost no gas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=256.7s)]
*  There is almost no cell service. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=258.5s)]
*  There's limited power. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=261.9s)]
*  There is limited food. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=264.3s)]
*  There are people who are trying to find potable water to feed their families, to have water for their kids. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=266.9s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=275.3s)]
*  Jacobina. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=276.1s)]
*  And guys, I have a live guest here just walked up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=277.5s)]
*  What is your name? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=281.3s)]
*  Jacobina Ola. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=282.1s)]
*  And what have you gone through here? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=283.3s)]
*  You have an artist gallery here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=285.0s)]
*  What has this been like? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  Studio. I have a studio, Northlight Studios. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  It's one of the few that is saved. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  But all my colleagues lost everything. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=292.5s)]
*  What was this like? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  Were you prepared for this kind of? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=296.0s)]
*  No, I came from Florida after Hurricane Ian. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=297.8s)]
*  I thought this is the area to be safe and this is not safe. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=301.7s)]
*  So even though the forecast called for this much rain, were you expecting this impact? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=308.7s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  I had no clue. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=314.9s)]
*  Do you feel like the messaging could have been better? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  No, because they said they said this was could happen, but it was hard to believe. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  How about aid? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=327.5s)]
*  Aid communication. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=329.0s)]
*  Do you feel like that's been going okay? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=331.6s)]
*  What needs to happen? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  We need to get some kind of radio station that is safe somewhere, maybe not where the weather is going to hit and that everybody can tune in because we only get some commercials and that's not what we're waiting for. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=334.6s)]
*  We want to know what to do. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  How is your family and loved ones doing? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=353.5s)]
*  We're all good. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  We have power and water, but I live in Candler. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=356.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  So we're up the hill. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=360.5s)]
*  Anyone you know that needs help right now? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=362.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=364.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=365.8s)]
*  There's still many people cut off to the care. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=366.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=368.4s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=368.9s)]
*  We don't have internet service, no cell, nothing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=370.3s)]
*  So that's the biggest, really the biggest problem, communication. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=374.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=378.7s)]
*  Listen, thank you very much. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=379.6s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=381.0s)]
*  And if you learn anything, come by and let us know as we're doing live reports. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=381.7s)]
*  Okay, very good. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=385.7s)]
*  This is the key guys. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=386.4s)]
*  Hearing from residents, you heard her the biggest issue communication right now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=388.20000000000005s)]
*  And yes, it is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=392.0s)]
*  And you would think in this modern day and age, we would not have communication issues. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=392.8s)]
*  Things need to be looked at in the aftermath of this. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, right now, right now in the short term. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=403.8s)]
*  Robert, thanks so much. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  Hearing from a lot of people that live in that area, they say Chimney Rock has gone, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  Black Mountain, Montreat, Asheville, the Shelby area, no water, no power there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=410.5s)]
*  Hendersonville is underwater, Lake Lure, and we saw a video of Asheville, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=416.0s)]
*  which is where the Biltmore Estate is. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=419.5s)]
*  And by the way, that's where you need AM radio. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=421.8s)]
*  AM radio is local radio, and that's why people lean on it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=423.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, your Fox weather is your hurricane headquarters. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=426.0s)]
*  If you've been watching it, there was some casting on Fox Business this morning. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=429.2s)]
*  There was some casting on a lot of our overnight coverage. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=432.6s)]
*  Been on top of this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=434.3s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=435.3s)]
*  So that's a good way to get information if you've got electricity and you've got service. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=436.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, families affected by the hurricane urgently need support, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=441.2s)]
*  financial support and other stuff. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=445.0s)]
*  Help the American Red Cross provide meals and shelter to those families. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=447.4s)]
*  Donate today to Hurricane Helene Recovery Efforts by going to, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=450.8s)]
*  and there's the website right there, redcross.org slash Fox Forward. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=454.8s)]
*  Or open up your phone, turn on the camera, stand that QR code. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=460.0s)]
*  A little yellow button will pop up at the bottom. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=465.7s)]
*  Push that and it'll take you to their website. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=468.4s)]
*  A friend of mine that lives in the Tampa area had flooding in her basement. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=470.8s)]
*  The house next to her, completely the whole downstairs, completely flooded. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=474.0s)]
*  She went to her old neighborhood. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=478.0s)]
*  Three of the houses were caught on fire in that neighborhood. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_EREaFBhg&t=479.2s)]
