# 'Please stop!': Trump warns Biden to stop selling border wall parts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY)
*  Incoming border guard Tom Homan is slamming San Diego's new super sanctuary policy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=0.0s)]
*  It is valueless to try to thwart it as President-elect Trump calls on President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=5.12s)]
*  Biden to stop selling off portions of the border wall. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=8.88s)]
*  And what they're doing is really an act. It's almost it's almost a criminal act. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=12.8s)]
*  I'm asking today Joe Biden to please stop selling the wall. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=17.04s)]
*  The up here discusses retired border patrol chief in Yuma, Arizona Chris Clem. Chris, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  first off on what San Diego is doing. They say, well, we're worried about the illegal [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=27.36s)]
*  immigrants who might be abused in some way. They might be afraid to come forward, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=32.08s)]
*  but that's not the point is it? No, it's not the point. They're putting up hurdles and blocking [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=35.92s)]
*  the administration, the incoming administration, their enforcement efforts. But look, the very [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  people they're trying to protect. Why don't they take a page out of, I never thought I'd say this, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=46.72s)]
*  New York City and find ways to cooperate with Tom Homan and DHS. Because if you are a non-citizen, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=51.92s)]
*  if you're an illegal alien, you are a victim of a crime or you can help the government prosecute. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=58.24s)]
*  There are protections that we can give you so we can get those that are exporting you [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=63.2s)]
*  and exploiting the system prosecuted. How about some compassion, some common sense here San Diego [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=67.76s)]
*  versus trying to throw up hurdles and roadblocks keeping integrity out of all. All right, so now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=72.56s)]
*  you're splitting the screen with pieces of the border wall fence. Now there's some reports that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=77.76s)]
*  it's not usable. It looks very usable to me. They say, oh, it's covered in cement. It doesn't look [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  covered in cement there. I see it on flatbed trucks being sold on pennies on the dollar. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=87.04s)]
*  This is our money, taxpayer dollars being sold because Joe Biden doesn't like walls. So he's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=91.28s)]
*  doing it on pennies of the dollar. He lost, his party lost. The new guy's coming in. He's like the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=97.84s)]
*  old guy and America wants that wall built. What could you do? What can be done? Well, first of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=104.0s)]
*  all, I live right here in this area, Southern Arizona, and I see that wall. It looks perfect. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=111.12s)]
*  It's in good condition. It's the desert. A lot of things don't rust out here. We can use it. The [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=116.24s)]
*  agents could use it. And this is, like you said, this is just spite out of an outgoing limping [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=120.8s)]
*  administration that is just trying to get to the finish line and putting up roadblocks again. This [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=126.48s)]
*  is American material that has been bought and paid for by the taxpayers, payers. Let's put a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=131.36s)]
*  penny saved as a penny earned. Let's put that wall to use. It could be used and we could do [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=136.4s)]
*  something very rapidly just trying to cause problems for the incoming administrations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=141.12s)]
*  Ridiculous. It's about border security. I know. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick was told when he [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=145.52s)]
*  said Texas was just going to buy it. And they were told, well, no, this stuff is damaged and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=150.08s)]
*  it's full of cement and it's corroded. I think he got bad information because that stuff by [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=154.24s)]
*  Art De Queto looks fine. So I think there's some misinformation there, but every moment matters. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=159.2s)]
*  Chris, thanks so much. Hopefully help is on the way. Yeah, we got coming. We need it. We're ready. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSf6YIYyNzY&t=164.72s)]
