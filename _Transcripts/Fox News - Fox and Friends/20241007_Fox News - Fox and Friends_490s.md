# Lawrence Jones describes Helene devastation: 'Picture a war zone in a movie'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc)
*  And we start with this Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Southeast is picking up the pieces after Helene killed more than 230 people, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=2.4s)]
*  making it the deadliest hurricane to hit our mainland since Katrina. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration is sending 500 more active duty troops to hard hit North Carolina, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=11.8s)]
*  bringing the total to 1,500, as thousands are still waking up without power. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=17.0s)]
*  Remember, it happened two Thursdays ago. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Lawrence is live in North Carolina with a firsthand look of the destruction. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Lawrence. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=27.8s)]
*  Hey, good morning, family. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=29.8s)]
*  And just to show you the scene here, the best way I can describe it is if you picture a war zone in a movie, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=31.0s)]
*  well, that's what this community is facing right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=38.2s)]
*  I want you to look at this guy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=40.4s)]
*  This used to be a car repair center right here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=41.6s)]
*  And you see this car that has been devastated right here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=44.8s)]
*  You look inside of the building, there's other cars that are in there that are just pinned down. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=47.6s)]
*  On the other location right here is a mattress location. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=53.0s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=58.2s)]
*  We had to literally go to Google Maps to figure out exactly what it was. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=59.4s)]
*  On the other side is a service station completely hit as well. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=64.6s)]
*  And the people are coming together right now, private organizations pitching in. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=68.4s)]
*  But there's a lot of questions about where is the federal government? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=72.8s)]
*  They say they're here, but the people feel a different way. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=76.0s)]
*  We spoke to them yesterday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=79.8s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=81.2s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=82.2s)]
*  We never thought it would hit up here in these mountains like this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=83.4s)]
*  But when we walked down and seen that road gone and that bridge gone, I mean, it took my breath. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  I was like, what happened? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=91.8s)]
*  Lots of disaster in this area, a lot dead, a lot with that power and water. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=94.0s)]
*  We don't know when the water will be restored. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=100.0s)]
*  I don't have either right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  My son hiked five miles to get me. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=104.2s)]
*  We went through all the devastation of there were no roads. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=106.4s)]
*  There were no homes. There was nothing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=110.4s)]
*  Just so much damage. It's been somewhat overwhelming. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=112.2s)]
*  We feel like we're in a war zone. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=116.0s)]
*  People have drove up and they've saw what we've got. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=117.4s)]
*  And they've just covered their face in their hands sobbing that they were able to find something. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=121.0s)]
*  Something to eat, something for their babies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=127.2s)]
*  It's such an outreach from around the country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=129.0s)]
*  I mean, folks from all states coming in and they're just helping us and bringing supplies in, truckload after truckload. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=131.4s)]
*  I think that our government can do more. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=138.4s)]
*  No, because we're going to need the help. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=142.8s)]
*  There's roads gone. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=145.4s)]
*  There's, you know, it's going to take a lot to rebuild us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=146.4s)]
*  There's so much more that could be done and giving us $750 if you can even apply for it is ridiculous. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=149.8s)]
*  And I've only heard of a handful of people getting approved. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=157.0s)]
*  $750 isn't going to do anything even if you do get approved. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=160.0s)]
*  Not with the damage we're seeing, not with the hurting that people are going through right now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=163.0s)]
*  Where is the help for Western North Carolina? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=167.2s)]
*  We can send billions to Ukraine and we can help Western North Carolina. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=171.2s)]
*  That's our money. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  We pay it in. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  We work and we should receive some benefit from the government for what with our own money. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=178.6s)]
*  It's just not right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  The people of Western North Carolina that are hit hard should not be suffering like this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't think she's doing enough and I don't think Biden's doing enough either. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=191.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  Everybody I talk to, it's pretty much a slap in the face. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=196.6s)]
*  We're not getting the support from her, from the president, the sitting president. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=199.0s)]
*  We're just kind of having to suffer through it and figure it out on our own. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  I would say to Kamala Harris, this tragedy did not happen in a nice neighborhood downtown Asheville. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=208.6s)]
*  Step out, get your rain boots on, get your mud boots on, your gloves on and go out there and walk through [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=216.6s)]
*  What I hiked through for two and a half miles to get back to Asheville, to get back to my family, you hike it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Then you tell me what it's like. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  You step it up, you're up your game. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  As you can see the frustration and the passion from those residents. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring in Carson and Sarah, the pastors at One Focused Church. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  You asked me, what can I say? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  I said, tell me everything. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  Tell me some of the stories that you've heard from your membership. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  Some of the stories will break your heart. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=252.0s)]
*  Yesterday we met as a congregation and we just cried a lot of the time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=254.0s)]
*  I mean we have congregation members that have found bodies in mud wrapped around trees, trapped in. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=259.0s)]
*  It's just heartbreaking. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=268.0s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=270.0s)]
*  But I think one of the most amazing things that we've seen that's just blown us all away is how the community, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=271.0s)]
*  the people that live here are walking, getting in their vehicles, getting in their ATVs, getting in their 4x4s [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=276.2s)]
*  and they're literally taking balls of water and handing them to people saying, what do you need? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=283.2s)]
*  How can we help you? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=286.2s)]
*  They have chainsaws that they're just carrying with them, chopping stuff, going through creeks, going through rivers, just getting to people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=287.2s)]
*  You know I asked you, this Carson and Sarah as well, who's getting these bodies? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=293.2s)]
*  Are these the government officials that are cutting people down? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=300.2s)]
*  And y'all sent the people. People are doing this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=304.4s)]
*  The stories we've heard, it's been individuals. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=306.4s)]
*  It might just be a couple of friends and buddies that have gotten together and gone out and tried to be helpful [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=309.4s)]
*  and help with recovery efforts and everything and they've literally just gone and pulled bodies out of the debris. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=317.4s)]
*  How bad is it here? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=324.4s)]
*  I mean, you know, when people see it on national media and they hear the stories they say, oh this was a week ago, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=326.4s)]
*  everybody's in place, things are getting better. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  We still have a lot of people without power, without cell phone, without, and that's one of the biggest things is [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  we couldn't communicate with anybody. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  For four days? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  Still, we still can at our house. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  It's still super spotty and you can't not rely on it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  Yesterday at the church, which is just right over here, we just were able to make telephone calls with Verizon Wireless. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  Yesterday at about close to noon we were able to make some phone calls, but we weren't even able, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  it was hard for us to even set up supplies and get things because we couldn't even talk to each other. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=361.8s)]
*  We were trying to figure out, do we have any of the CB walkie talkies anywhere? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=365.8s)]
*  Yeah, coordination was difficult. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=369.8s)]
*  Coordination was difficult, but what was incredible was people were doing by word of mouth. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=371.8s)]
*  They were saying, I'll be back. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=376.8s)]
*  Let me go down the road, get you something, and I'll be back. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=377.8s)]
*  What do y'all need right now? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=380.8s)]
*  I mean, I've been impressed with the churches that have stepped up. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=382.8s)]
*  You've got Samaritan Purse that are on the ground, the helicopters in the air. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=386.8s)]
*  But how can we help? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=391.0s)]
*  I think one of the things, we've been blessed and overwhelmed with the amount of people locally, nationally. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=393.0s)]
*  I mean, we have people from Oklahoma up north, down south Florida that are contacting us trying to figure out what we need. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=400.0s)]
*  I've already sent supplies and everything, are making deliveries daily, if not multiple times a day. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=407.0s)]
*  I think one of the big things is to remember that it's super easy for the rest of the world to start to move on [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=412.0s)]
*  because after you hear a story for a couple days, it becomes old news. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=419.2s)]
*  This isn't going to be old news. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=422.2s)]
*  This is going to be lingering for a long time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=424.2s)]
*  And the people here, I mean, water. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=426.2s)]
*  A lot of people, some people have well water, but a lot of people are on city water. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=429.2s)]
*  It could very well be months before city water because the infrastructure was hurt so bad before it's up and running. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=433.2s)]
*  So this is going to be something that can't be fixed within a week or two with some donations. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=439.2s)]
*  This is going to take a long time. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=443.2s)]
*  So I think to not be forgotten about and that help is still going to be needed going forward for quite a while. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=446.4s)]
*  Carson, thank you all so much for giving me some time. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=452.4s)]
*  We're going to be praying for you guys. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=454.4s)]
*  We'll be on the ground as long as we need to be to make sure your story is covered. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=456.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=459.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=460.4s)]
*  And guys, this is something that we continue to hear about the response. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=461.4s)]
*  I mean, just local good folks, Christian organizations stepping up. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=464.4s)]
*  It just seems to be a little void when it comes to the response from the federal government, guys. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=470.4s)]
*  But the people are still going to be here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HHPSuJiwc&t=474.59999999999997s)]
