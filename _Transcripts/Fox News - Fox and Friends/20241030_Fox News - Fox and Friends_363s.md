# Ainsley Earhardt: They reveal themselves every election
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI)
*  Inside the White House, Joe Biden apparently goes on CNN and says something that is so [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=0.0s)]
*  damaging to the campaign, to her campaign. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=7.94s)]
*  She's out on the lawn, he's inside screwing stuff up with this soundbite. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=12.1s)]
*  And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=16.86s)]
*  Well, let me tell you something. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=23.3s)]
*  I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know or Puerto Rico where I'm in my home state of Delaware. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=25.1s)]
*  They're good, decent, honorable people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=32.54s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=34.78s)]
*  His demonization is seen as unconscionable and it's un-American. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=38.14s)]
*  It's totally contrary to everything we've done. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=42.86s)]
*  Hey, thanks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  So in other words, half the country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=46.66s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=48.86s)]
*  I mean, do you thought you could put his supporters in a basket of deplora, like in one [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=49.7s)]
*  basket of deplorables? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=54.74s)]
*  And now you have this comment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  Then they came out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=58.5s)]
*  It really wasn't much of a walk back. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  The White House press works when Andrew Bates said the president referred to the hateful [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=62.22s)]
*  rhetoric at the garden as garbage. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  The rally is garbage. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=69.18s)]
*  That really isn't a walk back. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=70.44s)]
*  The walk back should have been, hey, I misspoke. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=72.5s)]
*  I meant to say, but instead he didn't really do that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  And Andrew Bates, I don't think really corrected it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=78.7s)]
*  He said the only garbage I see floating out there are his supporters. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=80.78s)]
*  So he's calling the supporters garbage. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=85.98s)]
*  They just continuously reveal themselves in every election, whether or not it's Republicans [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=87.9s)]
*  with God and their guns or it's smelly Walmart shoppers or it's basket of deplorables or [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=92.34s)]
*  it's now this year, it's garbage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=99.54s)]
*  So it's just these coastal elites that are talking about middle America, the South, you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=101.54s)]
*  know, everyone in between, in between New York and L.A. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=106.1s)]
*  Yeah, Lawrence. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=110.9s)]
*  But they boxed they boxed themselves in when it comes to they have the coverages when it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=111.9s)]
*  comes to the media because they cover the comedian, the comedian that makes fun of every [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=118.18s)]
*  single race of people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=123.58s)]
*  All right. This is what he does. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  And if you don't believe me, you can watch The Daily Show with Jon Stewart goes through [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=126.66s)]
*  all the groups of people that he's made fun of. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=130.22s)]
*  And they associated that with the former president. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  Now you have the current president of the United States after they have covered for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=135.74s)]
*  days now after saying it was the Nazi rally. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=140.26s)]
*  They have to cover this scandal from the standpoint they've been doing it all week. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=143.74s)]
*  Right. And the comedian was only joking. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=148.82s)]
*  Yeah. And what was he telling the truth? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=152.74s)]
*  They said they added an apostrophe to the word supporters. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=154.98s)]
*  They put it after the S now to imply that Biden was only referring to that one person. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=158.58s)]
*  Right. So I'm not sure that we have the apostrophe. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=163.14s)]
*  Apology is going to fly for America. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=165.9s)]
*  Well, we've we've made it official. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=167.98s)]
*  We mentioned it on the show. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=170.18s)]
*  So last night, after that comment was made where apparently Joe Biden was doing a pre [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=171.74s)]
*  arranged appearance via Skype, Donald Trump was on the stage in Allentown, Pennsylvania. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=178.7s)]
*  Marco Rubio actually told him, hey, Mr. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=185.66s)]
*  President, breaking news. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=188.34s)]
*  Joe Biden just called all your supporters garbage. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=189.74s)]
*  Donald Trump thought about what Joe Biden said, and he had this observation about it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=193.7s)]
*  speaks to the cognition of the current commander in chief. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=200.34s)]
*  Please forgive him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  For he not knoweth what he said. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=208.22s)]
*  These people are terrible, terrible, terrible to say a thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=218.38s)]
*  Like that. But he really doesn't know he really honestly he doesn't. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=222.94s)]
*  And I'm convinced that he likes me more than he likes Kamala. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=226.18s)]
*  But that's a terrible thing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=233.46s)]
*  And, you know, for Kamala Harris, her closing message, Lawrence was Donald Trump is terrible. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=235.74s)]
*  He'll be even worse the second time around. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=241.46s)]
*  And he's evil and he's terrible. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=244.02s)]
*  And she did not really talk about a positive agenda that she was going to lay out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=247.22s)]
*  Well, yeah, there was no agenda. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=252.94s)]
*  There hasn't been an agenda the entire campaign. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=254.22s)]
*  But can we just talk about the president lie? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=257.62s)]
*  He was asked what he was supposed to be doing during this period of time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=260.82s)]
*  He told us that he was going to be watching the speech. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=263.78s)]
*  Why is he in front of a laptop? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=266.86s)]
*  Even talking at this point? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=268.58s)]
*  And so this goes back to the question of who's running the country? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=270.78s)]
*  A and number two, this is a guy that did not want to get out of the race. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=274.26s)]
*  He was forced out of the race. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=278.34s)]
*  He was forced out of the race and they tried to sideline him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=280.26s)]
*  But he still knows that he has the bully pulpit because he's still the president of the United States. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=284.38s)]
*  So he's going to do whatever he wants to do. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=289.14s)]
*  I think that's problematic. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  You don't want this coming out a week before the election calling part of the country garbage. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=293.14s)]
*  But it also tells you that the campaign has no organization. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=298.62s)]
*  They have no message. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=302.06s)]
*  They're not talking about the issue. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=303.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=304.46s)]
*  The only people that I have to hear when I speak to Kamala Harris supporter is they're saying, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't like Donald Trump. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=309.66s)]
*  They're not saying what she's for. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=310.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=312.74s)]
*  Well, one of the problems is. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=313.06s)]
*  Travel done. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=317.18s)]
*  The audience goes wild in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=318.18s)]
*  Part of the problem. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=320.3s)]
*  Part of the problem. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  We had the audience yesterday. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=322.82s)]
*  Part of the problem, though, is her campaign is like three different campaigns. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=324.3s)]
*  It's part of the Obama campaign. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=328.5s)]
*  It's the Biden campaign. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=330.3s)]
*  It's her campaign. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  It's all just an amalgam. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=332.5s)]
*  You got to figure the campaign people are. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=334.06s)]
*  Last night, we're blowing up the phones or blowing up the text saying, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=336.66s)]
*  what are you doing? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=339.18s)]
*  You got to wonder whether or not Kamala Harris is going to say, hey, Joe, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=340.26s)]
*  you got to lay low until I'm over the finish line. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=345.1s)]
*  Doug, do it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=348.7s)]
*  You have had somebody do it, but it's got to be said. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  The president. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhY_I0pwcI&t=351.74s)]
