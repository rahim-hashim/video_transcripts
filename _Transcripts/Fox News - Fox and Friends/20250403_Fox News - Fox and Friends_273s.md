# 'SHE WILL LOSE': Explosive book reveals Obama's true feelings
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU)
*  We've been talking about this here. It's a brand new book. It's called Fight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=0.0s)]
*  And it gives a behind the scenes look into the 2024 election, including what [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  former President Obama really thought about Kamala Harris, the Democrat, as the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=7.68s)]
*  nominee. It reads, in private conversations, Obama flat out told allies [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=11.4s)]
*  she would lose to Trump. He was right. He did not think she should be the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=15.76s)]
*  candidate and said one confident. He liked the idea of Michigan Governor [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=20.12s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer at the top of the ticket and Maryland Governor Wes Moore [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=24.2s)]
*  at the bottom. He didn't want a coronation of Harris. Jonathan Allen is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=27.52s)]
*  the co author of this book Fight, and it is a great book. And Jonathan, there [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=32.32s)]
*  was a fight within the Democratic Party about whether or not she was the one. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=36.92s)]
*  Obama didn't want her, and he wanted an open convention, a little mini [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=40.8s)]
*  convention. And she just short circuited everything she did. You know, there's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  this incredible moment on the day that Joe Biden decides to get out of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=50.08s)]
*  race. He's been getting all this pressure and he calls her up. And it's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=53.84s)]
*  been reported. The very broad outlines were reported as he tells her he's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=56.8s)]
*  getting out. She says, Are you sure? He says yes. And that's it. There were [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=60.32s)]
*  actually two phone calls between them because she had to beg Joe Biden to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  make a quick endorsement right. As soon as he gets out, she's got to get the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  delegates. She's got to get a whip operation. Call all the members of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  Congress, the governors, whatever. And Biden's like, I'm getting out. I might [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  endorse you like on Thursday, like a few days later. I want to take a victory [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=78.28s)]
*  lap, soak in my moment. And she's like, Joe, you have got to endorse me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=82.56s)]
*  So they go back and forth on this before Biden does it. Obama definitely did [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  not think she should be the Democratic nominee. He would not endorse that day [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  either. He would not endorse that day either. She talked to him. He said to her, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=93.8s)]
*  I don't want to put my thumb on the scale. She was disappointed, but not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=97.92s)]
*  necessarily shocked because he'd been behind the scenes trying to undermine [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  her for the last several weeks before Biden even got out. And of course, the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=104.88s)]
*  reason that Joe Biden stepped out was because he is not the Joe Biden who got [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=108.64s)]
*  elected four years earlier. And in your book, you talk a little bit about how [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  aides, they all knew what was up. They use shiny tape to show him where to go. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  They had a lot of makeup. Even if he was doing a Zoom call, he was a mess. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=121.6s)]
*  Yeah, he needed, again, fluorescent tape on the floor to show him where to go. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  He needed teleprompters to talk to small groups, small donor groups. He would put [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=131.12s)]
*  on makeup early in the morning to do cabinet meetings and then sometimes do [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=136.36s)]
*  the makeup and not do the meetings. Right? So they all knew that there was a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=139.68s)]
*  level of decline. I think there were varying appreciations for that. We talked [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  to one person who said it was particularly steep in early 2024, but they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  were doing risk mitigation. How do we make it less likely that Joe Biden falls [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  apart in front of the world? And look, if you like the train wreck of what [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=160.28000000000003s)]
*  happened on the Democratic side with all these cars piling up and all these [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=166.16s)]
*  political leaders at odds with each other and being wrong about a lot of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=169.76s)]
*  things, this book's for you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=173.24s)]
*  This book is great. And it does have all the detail. And, you know, Barack Obama [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=175.4s)]
*  hasn't come out and said, oh, that's not true. You've also got some detail about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=180.04s)]
*  the night of the debate with Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And Donald Trump at one [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=185.72s)]
*  point felt, am I being too tough on him? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=191.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's sort of this amazing talent that Trump has for being in the moment [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=195.92s)]
*  and also seeing it from outside, sort of being a stage manager, if you will. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=201.16s)]
*  And he's watching Joe Biden fall apart. He's seeing these answers go terribly. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=205.44s)]
*  I think people will remember that moment where Trump says, I don't know what he [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=208.76s)]
*  just said and I don't think he does either. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=213.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  It's sympathetic. I mean, for Trump with an opponent on stage, you know, typically [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=215.56s)]
*  he's not particularly sympathetic. But in this case, he's looking at Biden. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=220.04s)]
*  He's like, this looks terrible. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=223.64s)]
*  And he starts thinking to himself, how do I keep hitting this guy without looking [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=225.4s)]
*  like a jerk? Because the media is going to talk about how I went off the rails. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=230.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  And I need to just kind of keep it in and not not look like a jerk, not come off [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=234.64s)]
*  poorly. And so he reigns it in. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=239.16s)]
*  But that's what's going on, according to our sources, in Trump's mind, as he's on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=240.92s)]
*  the stage with Joe Biden. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, you and your co-author wrote the definitive book about the train wreck [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=246.04s)]
*  that was Hillary Clinton's campaign. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=250.4s)]
*  And now you're back with this. It is a great book. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=252.12s)]
*  It is called Fight Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  It's now on sale. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=258.16s)]
*  Jonathan Allen, thank you very much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=260.04s)]
*  Thank you, Steve. Good luck to you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tby-HsN5qhU&t=261.76s)]
