# American protester defends Hamas as 'freedom fighters'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E)
*  Well yesterday we were on this actual set talking about at 12 o'clock yesterday at noon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=0.0s)]
*  They were gonna be kids walking out of their classroom your schools [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=5.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=8.34s)]
*  this was all the public schools in New York City mainly the high school students were walking out and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Protest of what's happening. They it's called shut it down for Palestine rally [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=13.82s)]
*  So they're pro-palestinians and you can see the signs free Palestine stop this genocide. They were shouting out [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=18.72s)]
*  Something about Joe Biden how it's a genocide [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=25.64s)]
*  And Brian Brimberg went there and we talked to him earlier and he told us a little bit about what he saw there [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=28.48s)]
*  Listen to this. Oh, yeah [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=34.32s)]
*  This was him talking to some of the tragedy that Palestine is facing and that is like because of the Israeli government [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=35.64s)]
*  And because of our tax dollars, I think it's really scary and I don't like it [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=41.28s)]
*  Do you think it's possible for Hamas to free the hostages who are in Gaza right now? They've tried [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=46.08s)]
*  So Hamas has tried to free the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=53.32s)]
*  You're calling the Hamas terrorists some would call them terrorists you're calling them freedom fighters [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=57.24s)]
*  right [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=63.08s)]
*  Hmm and see this is the guy that was approved to speak when you go to these rallies [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=64.6s)]
*  They surround you they know exactly who you are. They have little tick-tock videos [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=70.16s)]
*  They have all these group chats of all the reporters that aren't friends [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=73.74s)]
*  They're not from fans of us with the enemy you know, because we don't like Hamas they like Hamas and so then when you get [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=78.56s)]
*  To these protests they surround you and they go. This is this is a member of the press [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=85.28s)]
*  They don't allow the kids unless they give them the opportunity to speak and that's what happened yesterday [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=88.5s)]
*  Brian Brimberg says that they stormed the New York Times that has spray-paint and that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=94.92000000000002s)]
*  75% of the crowd there had these face masks because they don't want the world to see who they are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=100.56s)]
*  They walked into the New York Times [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=106.02s)]
*  They occupied their lobby and they were passing out mock [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=107.5s)]
*  Newspapers that said New York war crimes instead of New York Times they had there was a police cruiser outside [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=111.42s)]
*  They bashed in the window. They had spray paint. They were spray painting cars with graffiti or different areas with graffiti, too [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=117.7s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, it's amazing. Is it what what one of these people cared about the Palestinian situation before October 7th? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  We were the pro-palestinian right you never even heard of it you have people right [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=131.74s)]
*  Protesting for or rallying for Armenia, but up until October 7th the massacre against the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=135.78s)]
*  Israelis they had no mission. What's going on here? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=142.66s)]
*  You are correct about that Brian [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  But when you look at the way they're teaching history inside New York City high schools and in universities [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=146.58s)]
*  They were prepped for this moment the in the oppressor oppressed continuum in their view of the Middle East in their [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=153.24s)]
*  anti-western anti-american anti-israel classrooms [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  Jan October 7th [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=164.5s)]
*  Regardless of who perpetrated it lit a match on a worldview that they already have and now they're willing to just embrace [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=167.18s)]
*  Intifada revolution from the river to the sea some of these foolish kids [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=174.34s)]
*  May not know what that means most of them know precisely to Pete's point on the universities before this terror attack even happened [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=179.74s)]
*  Hamas and all of their allies were taught on college campus to be freedom fighters. They weren't taught as terrorists [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=187.66s)]
*  So now that the conflict has happened [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=194.22s)]
*  Many of the message when I talk with these they feel like the attack was justified [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  Because of the conflict before the United States government has deemed Hamas a terrorist organization [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=202.7s)]
*  We can see what they did to the people in Israel [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=208.3s)]
*  So when you hear that man out on the streets saying they're freedom fighters their freedom fighters [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=210.7s)]
*  Why for putting a baby in an oven and burning the baby to death? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=216.22s)]
*  Why because they chopped off the little girl's foot and her brother's fingers while they were eating breakfast with their parents [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=219.9s)]
*  Gouged out the dad's eyes and cut off the woman's breasts and then killed them all after they had been through that gruesome attack [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=226.5s)]
*  Why would they that be freedom fighter? That's not the definition of a freedom fighter [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=233.3s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu was on with Brett beer yesterday and was asked about these pro-palestinian [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=238.34s)]
*  Marches and what's happening in our universities and Rashida to leave posting that video [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  From the river to the sea and he explained what that means to the Jewish state listen [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=247.82s)]
*  From the river to the sea means there's no Israel from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean, which is a tiny area by the way [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=253.94s)]
*  That encompasses Israel. There is no Israel [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=260.14s)]
*  And so what this congresswoman is calling for is poliside and genocide the elimination of the Jewish state [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=262.58s)]
*  The one and only Jewish state of the Jewish people so that's that's absurd and I salute the Congress for censoring her [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=269.9s)]
*  So he had a long interview with Brett yesterday after ABC two days before he also talked about the pause [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=277.06s)]
*  Didn't even say what's gonna be one hostage is an approach, but they're gonna forge ahead [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=284.06s)]
*  They have to get rid of a moss. This can't be retaliation. This has to be elimination [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=288.86s)]
*  He knows the American system he knows what she she knows he knows that she knows exactly what she's doing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=294.62s)]
*  Probably what's most disturbing is he probably wouldn't recognize Fifth Avenue with that rally yesterday at four [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=300.98s)]
*  He probably wouldn't have recognized Los Angeles as you had American Jews fighting pro Hamas people out in California [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=306.58s)]
*  Meanwhile, he is over there probably pretty the Palestinians have to be just elated Iranians have to be elated [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=315.3s)]
*  Look at what we have done inside America with the next generation and that's part of their strategy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  Hamas's strategy is to draw this out as long as they can counting on international [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=328.06s)]
*  Condemnation pressure inside America against this White House [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=334.18s)]
*  So they don't get utterly eradicated which is exactly what should happen to them in Gaza, but it didn't have to be this way [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=337.5s)]
*  Yes, it didn't I mean look at the look at what happened in Afghanistan [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=343.86s)]
*  The war that was started in Ukraine look at what Hamas did in Gaza [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  They just so happened to happen in the last two and a half years [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure happening about you shocked when you see the amount of people that show up for these protests [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=356.02s)]
*  That Rashida to leave actually wins elections. I'm surprised that that's her constituency [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=360.86s)]
*  In that area, I'm not surprised that they share the viewpoint of hers [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=367.42s)]
*  But it goes to the point that Pete was making though about it didn't have to be this way [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=371.74s)]
*  When you look at the polling American said that they felt safer under Donald Trump that they don't like the way Joe Biden is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=376.42s)]
*  Handling the conflict Donald Trump was asked to respond to that about the current conflict [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=381.94s)]
*  And he said it wouldn't have happened under his watch watch [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=387.3s)]
*  With me if I were president if we had the Trump administration [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=395.38s)]
*  Impossible to happen. We were actually getting along well with Iran [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=399.38s)]
*  We would have had a deal with Iran and they didn't have the funds to do what they're doing now now [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=402.74s)]
*  They have a lot of funds not the six billion dollars, you know, they gave five hostages and five hostages [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=407.78s)]
*  That sounds good, but they also gave access to six billion dollars [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=413.82s)]
*  That's a lot but that's peanuts compared to the oil money because we made it so and then they freeze those funds [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  So that was his sitting down with Univision it made sense because he's once the Hispanic vote [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=426.86s)]
*  He said some nice things about his panics. He really loves Hispanics [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  And he talked about how good he got along with the Mexican president now [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=436.42s)]
*  They use that relationship to help crack down on the Mexican southern border [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=439.26s)]
*  Which actually leaving it in pressure on our northern border and this this Mexican president is also [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=443.02s)]
*  Basically haranguing president Biden and governor DeSantis. Yeah openly even though Donald Trump was the first to bring up [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=448.74s)]
*  We will use special forces to take out cartel members. You're missing it [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=455.14s)]
*  It all goes back to the taco bowl at Trump Tower. That's where it started. You got the best. Yeah, the best. They're the best over there [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5B3Idix37E&t=459.38s)]
