# Lara Trump: Eric Adams is ‘willing to work’ with Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU)
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams sitting down with our very own Laura Trump covering everything [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=0.0s)]
*  from leaving the Democratic Party to joining forces with President Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=7.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=11.92s)]
*  You have a different view of the city when you put on a bulletproof vest for 22 years [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=12.92s)]
*  and you protect it to children and families of the city. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  I see the byproduct of failed legislation and those who are wanting to go into their [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=19.72s)]
*  own corners. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=25.76s)]
*  Most importantly, it's about respecting the office. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=27.08s)]
*  People lose sight of that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=31.36s)]
*  You don't all of a sudden become anti-American because the person you wanted to be president [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=34.08s)]
*  is not president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=38.56s)]
*  It's the office. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=39.56s)]
*  When you don't respect the office, you're sending the wrong message. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=40.56s)]
*  I respect the office. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=44.56s)]
*  There's a president called President Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=45.56s)]
*  I'm going to work with that president to produce for the people of our city because I respect [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=47.8s)]
*  the office. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=52.96s)]
*  That's the office and that's the flag that Uncle Joe died in Vietnam for at 19 years [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=53.96s)]
*  old. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=59.36s)]
*  So I'm not for those who are desecrating our flag, who are on our college campuses radicalizing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=60.36s)]
*  our children, who are being harmful to what this country stands for. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=65.48s)]
*  I don't care what they say. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=69.56s)]
*  This is the greatest country on the globe and in God we trust. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=70.56s)]
*  That sounds like a guy running for office. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=76.84s)]
*  We're here with more on this interview that's premiering tonight, the host of My View, Laura [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=78.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=84.12s)]
*  Laura, it's so great to have you on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=85.12s)]
*  Your show is fantastic, by the way. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=86.24s)]
*  It's like a must watch every single weekend. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=88.56s)]
*  The guests and you, of course. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=91.36s)]
*  But tell me more about this interview. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=93.28s)]
*  What did you take away from this? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=95.36s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=97.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so excited for tonight's episode. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=99.84s)]
*  Not only do we have Mayor Eric Adams, we also have the Secret Service Director, Sean [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  on who was famously on stage with President Trump, of course, when the situation of Butler [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=107.0s)]
*  happened. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=111.76s)]
*  So look, Eric Adams went into this interview with me and he said, nothing is off the table. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=112.76s)]
*  I am an open book. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=117.36s)]
*  You can literally ask me anything. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=118.36s)]
*  And so we covered a lot of topics. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=120.76s)]
*  I mean, you heard there from him how he's willing to work with President Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=122.16s)]
*  You know, we've seen him work with, of course, Sean Duffy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=126.12s)]
*  We've seen him work with Tom Homan. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=128.56s)]
*  He wants to keep the people of New York City safe, he says. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=130.32s)]
*  And he went so far as to make sure an ICE facility was on Rikers Island. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=133.58s)]
*  That was supposed to be a benefit to the people of New York City to deport these, you know, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=138.5s)]
*  illegal migrants who are criminals. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=143.3s)]
*  He wants to get them out of New York. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  Well guess what? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=147.06s)]
*  The New York City City Council has sued him for that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=148.06s)]
*  He talks a lot about that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=150.5s)]
*  But he talks about why he changed his party. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=152.18s)]
*  You might notice beside his name, there's an I, not a D. He is no longer running as [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=154.3s)]
*  a Democrat. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=158.94s)]
*  He's running as an independent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=159.94s)]
*  And I asked him about that decision and his answer was much like we've heard from so many [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=161.78s)]
*  people, which is that he says, I didn't leave the Democratic Party, it left me. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=165.46s)]
*  It's a very wide ranging interview. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=170.88s)]
*  But look, he really wants to do, he says, the best for the people of New York City. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  He feels like the charges that were leveled against him, he goes into that a little bit [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=177.36s)]
*  and talks about how he believes they were political. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=180.78s)]
*  But at the end of this, look, his whole goal is as an independent, he has a bright future [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  in mind for the people of New York City. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=189.58s)]
*  And I was so excited that he sat down with us for this really fun interview. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's great that he's sort of joining the Common Sense Party, but you do sort of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=195.94000000000003s)]
*  have to wonder, you know, where was this common sense for the first couple of years of his [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  administration when some really, really bad stuff was going down in his sitting? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=206.46s)]
*  Yeah, you do have to wonder about that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=212.3s)]
*  But he uses the word, Charlie, common sense. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=215.06s)]
*  When I asked him about that, he said, look, it's common sense. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=217.7s)]
*  People are worried about making sure that they can afford their homes, making sure they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=220.98s)]
*  have a great life for their kids. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=224.66s)]
*  They want the basics. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=226.54s)]
*  And I think his idea is much like a lot of people, which is that the Democrats have stopped [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=227.82s)]
*  focusing on common sense and the basics. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=232.98s)]
*  They have gone so far left and become so radical that so many people who once considered themselves [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  like himself, a lifelong Democrat, say, I can't be a part of this party anymore. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=240.42s)]
*  And so it's sort of interesting to see him say that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=246.17999999999998s)]
*  Now, one of the things he also talks about, of course, is the migrant situation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=249.26s)]
*  The fact that he spent seven and a half billion dollars as mayor of New York City to deal [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=253.33999999999997s)]
*  with the migrant situation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=257.82s)]
*  He does, by the way, give a lot of credit to President Trump for closing the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=259.32s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=263.9s)]
*  Most common sense thing he did was leave the party, I guess. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=265.02s)]
*  Yeah, maybe so. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=267.9s)]
*  Be sure to watch New York City Mayor Eric Adams with Laura Trump. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  That's on My View with Laura Trump tonight at 9 p.m. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=275.61999999999995s)]
*  Laura, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=279.34s)]
*  I will definitely be watching that interview. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  I always do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=283.02s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=284.02s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=285.02s)]
*  Happy Easter. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=286.02s)]
*  You too. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=287.02s)]
*  Happy Easter. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=288.02s)]
*  You too. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=289.02s)]
*  Right now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9SwJGtbDU&t=301.34s)]
