# Shocking footage shows unaccompanied toddler saying she came to US alone
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4)
*  Democrat cities and states are vowing to push back on President-elect Donald Trump's mass deportation plan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes as shocking new footage shows unaccompanied migrant children as young as two years old crossing into Texas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=6.0s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us live at the White House with more on that. Madeline. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=14.0s)]
*  Hi guys. Good morning. While the Biden administration is facing a lot of pressure from immigration groups, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=18.0s)]
*  it takes some sort of unilateral action to protect migrants. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=23.0s)]
*  The White House says it has no new policies to preview, choosing instead to enforce laws that are already on the books. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=27.0s)]
*  Democrat attorneys general, on the other hand, say they have been preparing for months, planning out how to Trump-proof their states. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=33.0s)]
*  Still, polls have consistently shown voters prefer some action in immigration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=39.0s)]
*  Yesterday morning, the Texas Department of Public Safety says they encounter a group of more than 200 migrants, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=44.0s)]
*  and among them were 60 unaccompanied children, including this two-year-old girl. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=50.0s)]
*  Venezuela, mama. Venezuela. Si? Que tantos a침os tienes? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=55.0s)]
*  Dos. Dos? Dos a침os? No menos con tu mama y tu papa? No? Venezuela? Para donde vas, mama? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=61.0s)]
*  Para mi mam치 y mi papi. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=70.0s)]
*  Onde est치n? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=72.0s)]
*  Estados Unidos. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=73.0s)]
*  Estados Unidos? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=74.0s)]
*  Per Texas DPS, that piece of paper that little girl was holding had a phone number and a name. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=78.0s)]
*  Congressman Byron Donalds tells Maria Bartiroma on Sunday Morning Futures the Democrats' resistance come at their own peril. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=83.0s)]
*  Democrat politicians have had a Marie Antoinette view of America for quite some time, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=90.0s)]
*  and if they decide that they're going to oppose deportations that 57 percent of the American people want to see enacted, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=96.0s)]
*  then they're going to have more political losses in the future. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=104.0s)]
*  President Trump and his team are going to deport illegal immigrants out of the United States. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=107.0s)]
*  That is the right thing to do. That's what the American people want to see happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=113.0s)]
*  Incoming border czar Tom Homan is expected to head to the Texas-Mexico border tomorrow, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=117.0s)]
*  and he will be joined by the governor, Greg Abbott. Guys, back to you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=122.0s)]
*  All right, Madeline, thank you very much. Speaking of Tom Homan, Tom was in an event last week [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=126.0s)]
*  where he was talking a little bit about how certain cities like Los Angeles, for instance, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=131.0s)]
*  Sanctuary City, which just passed a new ordinance that said they will not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=135.0s)]
*  He said that, you know, I'll send twice as many agents to a place like L.A. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=141.0s)]
*  to make sure that it happens starting on day one because ultimately they feel, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=146.0s)]
*  and Tom Homan has said, that Trump's victory was so sizable, he's got a mandate to do what he promised he would do. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=153.0s)]
*  And the thing he said was he was going to stop the flow across our southern border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=162.0s)]
*  And the good news is he would stop the flow of two-year-old kids at our southern border who, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=166.0s)]
*  who knows what kind of hell that kid went through before and will go through after they pass through the Texas DPS. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=172.0s)]
*  That little girl, she came over from El Salvador. She's only two years old. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=180.0s)]
*  She's pretty smart to be two years old and be able to say, I'm coming to the United States. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=185.0s)]
*  Here's my parents' phone number on this piece of paper. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=189.0s)]
*  There were 211 illegal immigrants that entered in that area in Texas, the Maverick County area. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=192.0s)]
*  And 60 of them were unaccompanied children like this little girl. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=198.0s)]
*  See, here's the thing. I think you need a PR team with Tom Homan. He's very good on camera. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=202.0s)]
*  But so people understand this is not brutal. You have to understand we need to see inside these facilities. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=208.0s)]
*  And we have to know that Joe Biden said, I have to move these people through as quick as possible. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=214.0s)]
*  And that is one of the reasons why their objective is don't leave the kids in these facilities. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=218.0s)]
*  You get too overcrowded. So what do you do? Move them through. Don't ask any questions. Move them through. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=222.0s)]
*  Put the DNA quits or kids down. Move them through. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=226.0s)]
*  But I think it's important when Tom Homan rolls this out, they want to show the image of Tom Homan callously saying, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=229.0s)]
*  these families that have been here nine years and are just trying to work under the radar, they're the problem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=236.0s)]
*  They're not the problem. But it's not OK that they're here. But the primary thing is going to be, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=242.0s)]
*  get these unaccompanied minors with their families, number one. Number two, get the criminals out of here first. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=246.0s)]
*  And there's 1.4 million of them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=252.0s)]
*  Which is going to take a long time. And I think to your point, Brian, you know what's going to happen on the other side. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=255.0s)]
*  You're going to have AOC and company crying at the gates again. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=260.0s)]
*  By the way, they've been silent for four years when these kids have been coming across the border being trafficked. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=264.0s)]
*  When people are dying because of the fentanyl, there's been zero tears. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=271.0s)]
*  There's been zero protests at the border. There's none of that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=274.0s)]
*  But that all is going to change the moment Donald Trump is sworn in. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=277.0s)]
*  So I think you're right. You got to have a media strategy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=281.0s)]
*  You can't just do it because right now, remember, the country is for mass deportation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=284.0s)]
*  They weren't. They weren't. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=288.0s)]
*  So you got to be prepared when the left does the outrage tour to combat that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=290.0s)]
*  Right. But here's the... [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=295.0s)]
*  Robert Holder is coming up shortly as somebody in New York, Democrat, that says get rid of the sanctuary. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=296.0s)]
*  It's not legal. Stop with the sanctuary city status. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=302.0s)]
*  Ultimately, I don't know how much of PR team Tom Homan is going to need because I don't think images like that, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=305.0s)]
*  where there are 211 migrants on American soil, is going to happen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=311.0s)]
*  We've heard that the president wants the remain in Mexico policy reinstated. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=316.0s)]
*  And it sounds like he's going to be talking to the president, probably already has talked to the president of Mexico, saying, stop them on your side. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=321.0s)]
*  We don't need the problem over here. I'm just going to send them back. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=328.0s)]
*  Don't let it happen. Tom Homan was had a great observation. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=332.0s)]
*  We have talked about how it is an invasion on our southern border ever since 9-11. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=337.0s)]
*  And in fact, he invoked that yesterday. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=342.0s)]
*  I think the media is wrong and just about everything they print. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=347.0s)]
*  Look, we need DOD. I'm hoping we get DOD's assistance. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=350.0s)]
*  And I think President Trump can make that happen. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=353.0s)]
*  I agree with you. The southern border, I've been saying this for almost four years. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=355.0s)]
*  What's happened to our southern border is the biggest national security vulnerability this country's seen since 9-11. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=359.0s)]
*  We know terrorists have crossed that border. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=364.0s)]
*  Just take Tren del Agua, for example. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=366.0s)]
*  They are a threat to our national security. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=368.0s)]
*  And the cartels in Mexico have killed a quarter of American Americans with fentanyl. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=371.0s)]
*  We have a lot of dangerous people in this country. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=375.0s)]
*  We need to find a removal because they directly pose the biggest national security threat to this country right now. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=377.0s)]
*  And even Christopher Wray, who I have zero respect for, even he's testified numerous times. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=383.0s)]
*  This is a huge national security threat. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=388.0s)]
*  We got that caravan coming here now, still on its way. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=390.0s)]
*  It takes 18 days. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=393.0s)]
*  They better hurry before January 20th. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=394.0s)]
*  Right, but when they get to the border, I think they're going to get stopped. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=396.0s)]
*  I mean, if they don't get broken up, they don't get broken up immediately. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=399.0s)]
*  It's so weird that the current administration is like they're not even doing anything. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=402.0s)]
*  They're not protesting when the Trump people get involved. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=406.0s)]
*  They're not talking to the press at all. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=409.0s)]
*  I don't even know why they even haven't, you know, press availabilities. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=411.0s)]
*  It's as if they phoned it in. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=415.0s)]
*  The vice president goes to Hawaii coming back today. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=417.0s)]
*  The president's going to go to Staten Island and do something at a shelter for Thanksgiving. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=419.0s)]
*  He's pardoning turkeys today. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=424.0s)]
*  I was listening to some of the media commentary, and they were all outraged that Donald Trump hasn't done a press conference ever since he's become president. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=426.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=434.0s)]
*  What's the current president of the United States? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=436.0s)]
*  Have we just decided that he's a non-factor while he has the nuclear codes? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=438.0s)]
*  We're more concerned about the president-elect and the current commander-in-chief? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=444.0s)]
*  Could I just say, I'm sorry, go ahead. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=449.0s)]
*  What upsets me is when you see these little pictures of these little girls. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=451.0s)]
*  That little girl is two years old. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=454.0s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=456.0s)]
*  Where are her parents? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=457.0s)]
*  Her parents could have sent her. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=458.0s)]
*  But what parent does that? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=460.0s)]
*  What parent can do that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=462.0s)]
*  It's such a good point, Aysen, because the conversation is going to change into Donald Trump is separating families. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=464.0s)]
*  What about the families coming across the border that's already separated? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=470.0s)]
*  And who's bringing her over? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=473.0s)]
*  Are they rapists? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=475.0s)]
*  Coyotes? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=476.0s)]
*  Are they coyotes? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=477.0s)]
*  How much are they getting paid? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=478.0s)]
*  Who's paying them? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=479.0s)]
*  Where are her parents? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=480.0s)]
*  Is that really your parents' name and number on the slip? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA7gBsZ4ol4&t=481.0s)]
