# 'This could get real ugly, really fast,' columnist warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI)
*  How many more assassination attempts on Donald Trump until the president and the vice president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=0.0s)]
*  and you pick a different word to describe Trump other than threat? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=5.72s)]
*  I actually completely disagree with the premise of your question, the question that you're [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=9.64s)]
*  asking. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  It is also incredibly dangerous in the way that you're asking it because American people [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=16.48s)]
*  are watching. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=22.56s)]
*  Peter Ducey pressing the White House over calling Donald Trump a threat despite multiple [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=24.28s)]
*  attempts on his life. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=29.24s)]
*  In a new op-ed, our next guest warns that this rhetoric risks the normalization of assassination [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  attempts on people in politics. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  Columnist David Marcus joins us right now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  David, good morning to you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=43.36s)]
*  Morning, thanks for having me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=44.36s)]
*  You know, the White House, we've known for a while this has been the White House's game [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  plan to get Joe Biden re-elected as president. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=51.959999999999994s)]
*  Just paint Donald Trump as a threat to democracy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=55.16s)]
*  They've said it a million times. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=58.92s)]
*  But then there have been two assassination attempts and they're still calling him a threat. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=67.28s)]
*  Yeah, look, this whole thing is unconscionable. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=68.28s)]
*  We now know that the bomb threats to the schools in Springfield, Ohio were foreign hoaxes, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=72.08s)]
*  right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  We don't know from what country because Governor DeWine won't tell us, but these are most [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  likely information operations meant to sow division. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  If so, well done, full marks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=86.28s)]
*  And the Democrats and their allies in the media are pushing this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Now, it's bad that Trump and Vance are being absurdly blamed for Trump's own assassination [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=92.28s)]
*  attempt. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=97.6s)]
*  It's bad that the Democrats are very likely pushing an information operation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=98.6s)]
*  But the worst part of this is that the good people of Springfield, Ohio, who I just spent [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=102.1s)]
*  several days with, are being smeared as racist, MAGA monsters who want to blow up schools. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=105.96s)]
*  That is the clear implication. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=111.44s)]
*  And it is a damnable lie. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=113.06s)]
*  These people deserve an apology from the media and they deserve an apology from Vice President [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=115.12s)]
*  Connola Harris. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=119.0s)]
*  David, your op-ed, which is available at FoxNews.com, says the left has normalized assassination [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=120.0s)]
*  attempts. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=128.28s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=129.28s)]
*  So I was in Toledo on July 12th. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=130.76s)]
*  I'd been going around for Fox Digital, driving across the country, just talking to voters. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=133.44s)]
*  And one of the things that I found on January 12th was at Tony Paco's Hungarian hot dog [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=137.72s)]
*  restaurant. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  I was interviewing two guys, fans of Nashville, recognize that name. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  And when it happened, the one guy looked at me and he goes, are you surprised? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=149.68s)]
*  But at the same time, the place stopped. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  Everyone went to the TVs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=155.4s)]
*  Everyone was talking about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=156.4s)]
*  It was definitely a where were you moment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=157.4s)]
*  Flash forward to Sunday, I was at a restaurant in Pennsylvania driving back from Springfield. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  Same thing happened. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=164.8s)]
*  There's another two guys. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=165.8s)]
*  My hand got, Steve. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=166.8s)]
*  The guy looks at me and he goes, are you surprised? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=167.8s)]
*  But this time, nobody changed the TV channel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=170.56s)]
*  Nobody talked about it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=174.04s)]
*  It was palpable. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=175.04s)]
*  It was like, nothing happened. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=176.04s)]
*  And that was scary because when we get desensitized to these things, it can get really ugly really [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=178.64s)]
*  fast. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  Well put. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSeVXyH0kI&t=184.27999999999997s)]
