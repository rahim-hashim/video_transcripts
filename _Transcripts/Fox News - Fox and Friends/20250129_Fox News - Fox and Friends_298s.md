# Karoline Leavitt takes legacy media to task in first briefing
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck)
*  The Trump administration has a new mandate for millions of federal workers who are now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=0.0s)]
*  used to working from home. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=6.54s)]
*  He says President Trump, they return to the office or they resign. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=8.82s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey has the details on the buyouts now being offered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=13.16s)]
*  Good morning to you, Peter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=17.64s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=19.0s)]
*  Everybody that works for the federal government got an email last night from their management [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=20.0s)]
*  that says if they reply, resign by next Thursday, they don't have to return to the office. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  One of this email says, if you resign under this program, you will retain all pay and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in-person [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=33.48s)]
*  work requirements until September 30th, 2025. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  The White House believes 100 billion taxpayer dollars could be saved based on this back [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=41.08s)]
*  of the napkin map. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=45.84s)]
*  Two million total federal employees, 6% of them work full time in the office. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=47.08s)]
*  200,000 of them are expected to take this buyout. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=52.44s)]
*  Retired General Mark Milley also got a notification from the federal government last night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=56.52s)]
*  He is suspected of usurping the chain of command during Trump's first term, so he is losing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=61.36s)]
*  his security detail and he might lose his star. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=66.84s)]
*  The Pentagon tells us the Secretary informed General Milley today that he is revoking the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  authorization for his security detail and suspending his security clearance as well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=73.48s)]
*  The Secretary has also directed the DOD IG to conduct an inquiry into the facts and circumstances [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=77.4s)]
*  surrounding General Milley's conduct so that the Secretary may determine whether it is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=82.48s)]
*  appropriate to reopen his military grade review determination. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=86.48s)]
*  The Trump administration also bringing big new changes to the briefing room. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=91.0s)]
*  We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers, and content creators [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  to apply for credentials to cover this White House. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Standing today, this seat in the front of the room, which is usually occupied by the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=107.56s)]
*  press secretary's staff, will be called the new media seat. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  And some big news out of that briefing right off the top. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=116.92s)]
*  After President Trump pledged in the Oval Office last week to get us all information [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=119.64s)]
*  about those drones over New Jersey a couple weeks back, he sent Caroline out with the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=123.6s)]
*  answer she read from a presidential memo. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  They were FAA authorized drones that were joined by some hobbyists. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=131.24s)]
*  They were not the enemy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=135.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=137.48s)]
*  Thank you so much, Peter. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=138.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Kaylee McGee-White, Restoring America editor at the Washington Examiner [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=139.4s)]
*  and Steamboat Institute Blankley Fellow. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=144.44s)]
*  Good morning to you, Kaylee. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=146.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=149.24s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=150.24s)]
*  Let me play just for our audience in case they were at work and they didn't see the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=151.24s)]
*  briefing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=154.56s)]
*  Let me play a montage of a little bit of what she said yesterday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=155.56s)]
*  We're also opening up this briefing room to new media voices. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=158.88s)]
*  How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=162.2s)]
*  All of them because they illegally broke our nation's laws and therefore they are criminals [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=166.36s)]
*  as far as this administration goes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=169.68s)]
*  It is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=171.24s)]
*  of taxpayer dollars. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=176.12s)]
*  While I vow to provide the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=178.0s)]
*  hold yourselves to that same standard. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, Kaylee, I think it's smart of her that first, the first beginning part of that sound [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  bite, she said she's opening up these press briefings to more people, to the younger audience [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  too. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=193.8s)]
*  She's going to include influencers in the press room. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=194.8s)]
*  She's going to include podcasters, independent journalists, not just the legacy media, she [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  says both sides of the aisle. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  And she said she's going to restore press passes for 440 journalists whose press passes [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  were wrongfully revoked, she says, by the Biden administration. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=207.28s)]
*  As a, are you, you're a Gen Z-er. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=211.72000000000003s)]
*  As a Gen Z-er, how do you feel about this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=213.68s)]
*  Well, I think that's a great move. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=216.08s)]
*  And again, as a Gen Z-er, it is undeniably true that my generation engages with the news [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=218.68s)]
*  and consumes content differently than older generations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=224.0s)]
*  And the Trump White House clearly understands that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=227.08s)]
*  We're more likely to get our news from social media. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  In fact, a poll last year found that more than 70 percent of Gen Z-ers get their news [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=232.44s)]
*  on a daily basis from places like Instagram or TikTok. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, I'm not going to comment on whether that's a good thing, but it's just true. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=240.88s)]
*  We're also more likely to engage with independent forms of media that don't necessarily fit [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  neatly within the political spectrum. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  And again, the Trump campaign realized this and he met Gen Z-ers where they were at on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=252.04s)]
*  the campaign trail by engaging in different forms of podcasts. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=256.56s)]
*  And look at the results. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=260.2s)]
*  He was able to shift a sizable portion of Gen Z to the right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=261.28s)]
*  And even today, his recent approval ratings show that the generation most likely to support [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=264.76s)]
*  his recent actions is Gen Z. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=269.56s)]
*  He's winning over young adults. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=272.2s)]
*  And in order to keep them engaged with this administration in support of bringing in the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=273.88s)]
*  people that they listen to to the White House briefing room is a great way to start. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=278.28s)]
*  And Kayleigh, she did it without a notebook and very few notes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=282.96s)]
*  Thank you so much, Kayleigh, for coming on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=285.88s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=287.28s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7z5fvf40ck&t=288.28s)]
