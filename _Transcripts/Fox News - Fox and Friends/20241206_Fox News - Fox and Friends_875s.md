# Melania Trump talks 'incredible' win in 1st interview since election
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc)
*  Melania Trump, great to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=1.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=2.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=3.04s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=3.56s)]
*  I guess the first thing is congratulations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=4.08s)]
*  How has your life changed over the last three weeks? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=6.36s)]
*  It's not so new, but this is, we've never heard [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  had this happen, a president leave and come back in, what, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=11.92s)]
*  80 years? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's incredible. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=16.76s)]
*  And we are very, very busy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=19.12s)]
*  The life is the pace of it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=22.14s)]
*  The transition team, I'm establishing my transition [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=26.84s)]
*  team and also working on my office, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=30.08s)]
*  putting my office together, and also organizing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=35.6s)]
*  the residence and packing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=41.32s)]
*  And it's incredible what you need [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=43.28s)]
*  to do in that situation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Melania, in your book, you wrote about the Obamas [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=49.64s)]
*  and wanting to go into the White House in 2016 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=52.32s)]
*  and go in early so that you could find out [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=55.32s)]
*  what the room colors are to make sure you could have a room that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=57.28s)]
*  was suited properly for your son, your young son at the time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=60.16s)]
*  And there was some hesitation with letting you in early. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=63.8s)]
*  You probably don't need to go in early this time [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=67.16s)]
*  because you know what to expect. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=69.16s)]
*  But how is that working? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=70.48s)]
*  Have you been back to the White House? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=71.6s)]
*  Will you go in early to prepare? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=73.2s)]
*  Well, this time it's very different [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  because we already know where we are going. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=77.0s)]
*  And we have all of the plans from before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=79.44s)]
*  So we don't need to go back in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=82.76s)]
*  My team is in contact with the White House. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  So that's a plus. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  But we have all what we need. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=91.96s)]
*  So this is the second time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  So it's nothing new. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=95.48s)]
*  The first time was challenging. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=96.48s)]
*  We didn't have much access till we were in in January 20. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=99.16s)]
*  But this time it's already in the process. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=104.44s)]
*  Well, you don't have to go in and measure the drapes [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=107.12s)]
*  because you put the drapes there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=109.28s)]
*  So it's one of those things. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=110.96s)]
*  So take us back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=112.88s)]
*  We all remember in 2017 when he became president [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=114.8s)]
*  during this transition period, it was kind of a mad dash [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=118.36s)]
*  because it's like, oh, I won. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Now what do I do? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=124.24s)]
*  He's won before. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  He knows what to do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=126.88s)]
*  It seems much more focused and it seems really efficient. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=128.16s)]
*  I don't know if that's Elon Musk, the efficiency guy, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=131.44s)]
*  but it just seems so much calmer. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=136.32s)]
*  I think it's for everybody, even for me, it's very different [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=140.16s)]
*  because I know what you need to establish. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  You know what kind of people you need to hire [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=146.44s)]
*  that to be in your office. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=149.24s)]
*  So that's what I'm doing now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=150.88s)]
*  I'm interviewing people for my office. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=152.72s)]
*  I'm establishing everything what it needs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=155.44s)]
*  So we could start on day one. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=158.56s)]
*  Everybody's in and we start working. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=161.84s)]
*  Great. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=164.32s)]
*  You know, Melania, you don't get a lot of credit for this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=165.16s)]
*  but you did a lot when you were in the White House. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=166.88s)]
*  And some of the stories people don't know, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=168.76s)]
*  you put several students, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  and we're gonna talk about your ornaments a little later. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=172.32s)]
*  You pay for their college, put them through school. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=174.6s)]
*  So tell us about some of the programs you're gonna do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=177.32s)]
*  this next time around. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=180.6s)]
*  Well, when I was in the White House for four years, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  I established my Be Best initiative. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=184.84s)]
*  And I also successfully brought it over sea [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=187.44s)]
*  and around the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=191.76s)]
*  Was very successful. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=194.12s)]
*  And after I left the White House, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=195.48s)]
*  I established my Web3 and Web2 platforms [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=197.16s)]
*  where I design, where I have collectibles like ornaments [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=202.12s)]
*  every season, this is the third season, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=207.84s)]
*  and many other collectibles that are available now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=210.32s)]
*  So with those, I have students from a foster community [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=215.04s)]
*  that I sponsor and I'm very proud of. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=221.04s)]
*  And we have many of them now, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=225.04s)]
*  so their life changes because they will have an education. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=227.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=231.44s)]
*  So, I mean, so much has changed this time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=232.28s)]
*  Can I just give you my observation? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=234.64s)]
*  I saw the president last night. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=236.04s)]
*  And I saw when he was hosting The Apprentice. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  I actually interviewed him when he was with the USFL, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=239.92s)]
*  when I was doing sports and he was an owner. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=242.76s)]
*  And I have never seen him in person [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=245.04s)]
*  and I have never seen him so level. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=248.16s)]
*  He just seems calm, serene, accomplished, not cocky. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=253.2s)]
*  You see him every day in all different circumstances. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=256.84s)]
*  Are you noticing, even if you factor in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=260.08s)]
*  and maybe the factor in the assassination attempts, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=262.92s)]
*  a different approach right now at 78 years old [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=265.44s)]
*  that you maybe have not seen before? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=268.48s)]
*  I think because we were all, we've been there [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=271.12s)]
*  and he was there before and now it's different. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=275.84s)]
*  I think the energy is different. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=280.44s)]
*  People around him are different. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  But don't you think the magnitude of the win is different? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  It is. It is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  It was so comprehensive. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=288.56s)]
*  It is. It is. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=289.4s)]
*  How did he internalize that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=290.52s)]
*  I see that the country and the people really supported him [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  and they support him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=297.08s)]
*  His focus to make this country great again [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  and his patriotism, it's incredible. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  And his hard work as well. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=307.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there were two assassination attempts [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=309.44000000000005s)]
*  while he was running. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Now that he will be our next president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=312.24s)]
*  Do you feel like the rhetoric has been toned down [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=314.6s)]
*  and how do you feel? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  Are you worried going forward? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=318.36s)]
*  I hope it is. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=320.36s)]
*  I hope the country will be united [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  and that's what we all hope for. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=325.12s)]
*  And I'm always against violence. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=329.36s)]
*  I think nothing is accomplished with the violence [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=333.72s)]
*  and that's what we need to talk about it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  It's gotta be so thoughtful. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=345.6s)]
*  And we've heard him talk about, by the grace of God, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  he is alive today. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=350.72s)]
*  What we have seen since he was elected [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  and over the last couple of months [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=356.68s)]
*  is that calmness and maybe gratitude or whatever it is. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=358.68s)]
*  But something else we've seen is he seems so kind of happy [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=361.92s)]
*  and loose because last night at the Patriot Awards, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=366.96s)]
*  I think we got a clip, he was doing the Trump dance. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=369.64s)]
*  And I'm sure you've seen that evolve over the last. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  As you look right there, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=376.68s)]

*  Oh, this is very special and unique dance. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=382.48s)]
*  It is, right? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=385.88s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are copying it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=387.04s)]
*  and everybody have fun with it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=389.48s)]
*  Yeah, which part? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=391.8s)]
*  Is this how you dance? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=392.64s)]
*  No. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=393.76s)]
*  Which part of the Trump dance, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=395.48s)]
*  did you give him any tips like in the beginning, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=396.92s)]
*  it was low and then it was up high [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=399.52s)]
*  and now there's a golf swing? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=401.68s)]
*  No, he's coming all on his own. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=403.0s)]
*  Have you ever done the Trump dance? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=405.32s)]
*  You are Mrs. Trump. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=407.08s)]
*  I did not. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=408.56s)]
*  So I guess you're not gonna start today. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=409.4s)]
*  So Melania, everyone is so fascinated with Barron [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=412.4s)]
*  and as people may or may not know, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=418.08s)]
*  he helped the president with his social media strategy [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=420.2s)]
*  and said, hey, you gotta do some of these TikToks. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=423.56s)]
*  You gotta talk with some of these podcasts. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=425.4s)]
*  What is the fascination with your son? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=428.47999999999996s)]

*  He is a grown young man. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=452.88s)]
*  I'm very proud of him about his knowledge, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=454.84s)]
*  even about politics and giving an advice to his father. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  He brought in so many young people. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=462.2s)]
*  He knows his generation because nowadays [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=467.64s)]
*  the young generation, they don't sit in front of TV anymore. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=471.4s)]
*  They're all on the tablets, they're on the phones [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=474.8s)]
*  and all of these podcasts and streamers. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  He was very vocal and he gave an advice to his father [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=482.32s)]
*  and it was incredible how he brought in a success [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=486.64s)]
*  because he knew exactly who his father needs to contact [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=492.44s)]
*  and to talk to. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  Isn't it shocking how fast he went from that little boy [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=498.56s)]
*  to the big man? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=501.2s)]
*  What advice do you have for other moms? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  Because I'll go back and I'll look at videos [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=505.0s)]
*  of my daughter when she was that age [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=507.0s)]
*  and there's like a pain in my heart [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=509.12s)]
*  because I missed those years. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=511.32s)]
*  What's your advice for all of us that your son's [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=513.76s)]
*  in college now, you've seen him grow up. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=516.6s)]
*  How do you handle each stage? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=519.48s)]
*  I think you need to be present [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=521.88s)]
*  and to be with them as much as you can. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=524.16s)]
*  To be there as a teacher and give them guidance. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=528.12s)]
*  I think it's the most important [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=534.64s)]
*  because years goes by so fast. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=536.56s)]
*  We just don't imagine. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  It's like I see the clip that you just showed. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=541.12s)]
*  I feel like it was like a few months ago [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  but the time goes so fast. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  But here's your challenge [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=548.56s)]
*  that we don't have nobody watching us. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  He's trying to adapt to college as a freshman, always tough. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=552.2s)]
*  He's got secret service everywhere in New York City [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  where even not being 6'9 and famous, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=558.44s)]
*  you could be targeted for a random crime. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=561.6s)]
*  How has he managed to navigate him? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=563.96s)]
*  What advice do you give him to try to be, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=566.0s)]
*  is it possible for him to be a normal student? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=567.88s)]
*  I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=570.36s)]
*  His experience at college, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  it's very different than any other kid. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=576.2s)]
*  And I'm very proud how he's handling, he's very strong [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=579.36s)]
*  and he knows that he's in different position [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=583.76s)]
*  than other children. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=588.36s)]
*  And I just say, make your dreams come true. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=590.44s)]
*  This is your road, this is your life. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=596.48s)]
*  And make sure that you listen yourself [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=599.24s)]
*  and your likes and dislikes. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=602.64s)]
*  Right, he'd want to come over my tower for lunch. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  You don't really hear that from other people, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=607.36s)]
*  but evidently he likes it, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=609.88s)]
*  The Stern School? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=612.28s)]
*  Yes, he does, he does like it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=613.12s)]
*  All right, we're not too far away from Christmas. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=615.24s)]
*  And as it turns out, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=618.24s)]
*  your book is on the New York Times bestseller list. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=619.5600000000001s)]

*  want to know more about you. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=636.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes, it's a great success book. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=638.68s)]
*  I hear from so many fans and so many people [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=641.4s)]
*  that they read it and they loved it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=645.28s)]
*  Yeah, when you do the project like that, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  that it's very personal [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=650.4s)]
*  and could be sometimes very joyful, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=653.64s)]
*  but also very traumatic and hard. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  So when people read it and they go, you know what, I read it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  There's one thing in that I did not know about you. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=664.96s)]
*  Is there one thing that they repeatedly say, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=667.48s)]
*  I didn't know you did this? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=670.24s)]
*  Correct, they don't know few of the stuff, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=672.44s)]
*  even from my childhood, how I grew up [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=674.96s)]
*  and also from the White House years. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=677.24s)]
*  And they don't know and that's why I wrote this book. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=679.76s)]
*  One thing that stood out for us is here you are, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=683.44s)]
*  this beautiful international model. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=685.96s)]
*  And you're the first lady of the United States, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=688.36s)]
*  the world's most popular country. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=690.0400000000001s)]
*  You're in the White House [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  and you're not on the cover of any of these magazines. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=694.32s)]
*  She used to be. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=696.96s)]
*  Do you think that will change? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  And would you say yes to them? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  The Vogue's, the People's, whatever. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=702.6800000000001s)]
*  Look, I've been there on the covers, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  on the cover of Vogue, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=708.08s)]
*  on the covers of many magazines before. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=709.36s)]
*  And for me, we have so many other important things to do [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=711.72s)]
*  than to be on the cover of any magazine. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  I think the life would not change for anybody [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=722.76s)]
*  if I'm on the cover of the magazine. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=726.76s)]
*  Can I retract my question then? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=729.12s)]
*  But I guess it goes to the book. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  You're on the cover of this book. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=732.76s)]
*  If they want to sell copies, put her on. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=734.32s)]
*  If you read the book, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=735.88s)]
*  she talks about how Anna Wintour went to Paris with you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=736.72s)]
*  Is that where you went to shop for her wedding dress? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=740.0s)]
*  They were friends. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  She was on the cover of Vogue several times before that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=743.6s)]
*  And after that, because you're a conservative [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=746.44s)]
*  and married to Donald Trump. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=749.2s)]
*  Soon my husband announced [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=750.04s)]
*  that he's running for the president in 2015. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=752.48s)]
*  So crazy. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=755.12s)]
*  Everything changed for them and for us. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=755.9599999999999s)]
*  But Rosie O'Donnell went to your wedding too, right? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=760.4s)]
*  No, she did not. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=762.88s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=763.7199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=764.56s)]
*  So, Melania, you got the new season [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  of your ornaments coming out. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=767.9599999999999s)]
*  And this is how you pay for some of these kids' colleges [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=769.52s)]
*  as well. They're beautiful. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=772.36s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=773.1999999999999s)]

*  This is the third season that I design. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=777.92s)]
*  And they're very special. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=781.4s)]
*  For example, Lady Liberty. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=783.36s)]
*  It was inspiration from my necklace that I bought [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=786.5999999999999s)]
*  when I was modeling in Paris. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=791.52s)]
*  And now we have an ornament [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=794.04s)]
*  and we have also a necklace [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=796.24s)]
*  that it's available on melaniatrum.com. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=798.1999999999999s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=800.4799999999999s)]
*  So I also, this one, it's the necklace. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's inspiration. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=805.88s)]
*  The flower. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=808.0s)]
*  These are awesome. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=808.84s)]
*  These are very special. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  And they're very patriotic this year. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  As you could see, it's all red, white and blue. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=812.48s)]
*  And I was inspired by the- [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=815.6s)]
*  And they're different each year, right, Melania? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=817.88s)]
*  You discontinued them after each Christmas. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=819.8000000000001s)]
*  They discontinued, they retire. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=823.2s)]
*  And this is available right now. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=825.0400000000001s)]
*  And it's a great gift and a great collectible. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  They're made really well too. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=832.44s)]

*  and buy the coffee table book. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=836.48s)]
*  So the smaller black book came out a few months ago. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=837.88s)]
*  But then, which is still number one, I believe. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=841.72s)]
*  It has been number one for a very long time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=844.1600000000001s)]
*  And then the book underneath, the white book, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=845.64s)]
*  which is larger, it has more pictures in it [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=847.12s)]
*  and pictures that you took while you were first lady. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=849.24s)]
*  And that's a great Christmas gift. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=851.9200000000001s)]

*  It's your last year off for four years. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hb-VXELyEc&t=857.6800000000001s)]
