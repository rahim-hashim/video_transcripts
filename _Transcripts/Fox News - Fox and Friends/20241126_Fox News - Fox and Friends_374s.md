# 'A LOT OF MONEY!': Taxpayers on hook for Jack Smith's Trump cases
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk)
*  So let's talk a little bit about this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=0.0s)]
*  Special counsel Jack Smith has moved to abandon both federal criminal cases against Donald Trump. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=2.0s)]
*  Brooke Sigmon has the details on it. Hey Brooke. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=8.2s)]
*  Hey guys, yeah we are just 50 days out from his return to the Oval Office [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=11.0s)]
*  and President-elect Trump may have just gotten his biggest legal win yet. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=14.5s)]
*  So the federal judge on Monday moved to grant special counsel Jack Smith's request to drop the charges related to his 2020 federal election case. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=18.5s)]
*  Constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley says it was only a matter of time once Trump got re-elected. Listen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=26.5s)]
*  Smith was like a captain who would soon be without a ship or crew and he had to dismiss this case. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=32.5s)]
*  It wasn't by choice. What Smith knew is that this election would have the effect of the largest jury verdict in history. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=38.5s)]
*  That if the president was elected, he was out of a job and that turned out to be true. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=46.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump posting on Truth Social writing quote, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=52.5s)]
*  These cases, like all of the other cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless and should never have been brought. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=55.0s)]
*  VP of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, also reacting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=62.0s)]
*  The irony of Jack Smith is, I mean, he brought this case to try and make sure my father never got elected [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=66.0s)]
*  and I actually think it was Jack Smith who might go down as one of the very reasons my father got elected, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=71.0s)]
*  It's kind of the law of unintended consequences. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=76.0s)]
*  Separately, Smith's team also moved to end its appeal of the other federal judges' decision in the Southern District of Florida [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=78.5s)]
*  to drop the classified document case against the president-elect. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=84.5s)]
*  Now that Judge Eileen Cannon of the Southern District of Florida ruled earlier this year that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=88.0s)]
*  Alright, so here is a look at where all of Trump's legal battles now stand. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=95.5s)]
*  So Trump is no longer facing any sort of federal charges. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=99.5s)]
*  And here in New York, Judge Juan Marchand granted Trump's request to file a motion to dismiss the charges. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=103.0s)]
*  So we are also still awaiting a possible ruling from Marchand on presidential immunity. Guys? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=108.0s)]
*  Alright, Brooke, thank you very much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=113.0s)]
*  And at the very core, you know, because Jack Smith had, and Ainsley, you brought this up, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=115.0s)]
*  and Newsweek has done the calculations and they suggest that the Department of Justice and Jack Smith [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=120.0s)]
*  have spent over $50 million with these two, these twin prosecutions against him on the federal level. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=126.0s)]
*  But Jack Smith had no choice. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=132.0s)]
*  Department of Justice policy, and he was just following instruction from the way the law is written. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=134.5s)]
*  DOJ policy says it is unconstitutional to pursue prosecutions against sitting presidents. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=140.5s)]
*  And in 55 days he's going to be the sitting president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=146.5s)]
*  Now what's curious is, and we're going to talk to Jonathan, rather we're going to talk to Greg Jarrett here in about 15 minutes, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=149.5s)]
*  both filings request for dismissals without prejudice, and that leaves open the possibility that they could refile it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=155.5s)]
*  But here's the thing, the statute of limitations runs out after five years, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=164.0s)]
*  and of course that would be way past the end of, you know, it's going to expire essentially during his term, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=169.0s)]
*  and that's just not going to happen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=176.0s)]
*  So a couple things, he tried to litigate the court, the case, before the public, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=178.0s)]
*  because he knew he wasn't going to win in court. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=183.5s)]
*  He's been overturned multiple times by courts. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=185.5s)]
*  He went after Bob Mendes, lost there, went after John Edwards, lost there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=187.5s)]
*  And so the question is, why would you even appoint someone that is overzealous, that gets overturned? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=192.5s)]
*  The thing that I found fascinating yesterday watching the Sunday night show, I'm sorry, the Monday night shows on the other channels is, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=198.5s)]
*  there was a lot of criticism from their legal pundits on why Merrick Garden took so long to appoint him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=206.0s)]
*  Not that this is over, the spin last night was, if only he would have brought it sooner, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=214.0s)]
*  Donald Trump would be in jail by now and wouldn't have the chance to run. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=220.0s)]
*  Merrick Garland must be like, I wish it was just the, became Supreme Court justice, it would have been so much easier. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=224.0s)]
*  So the Dems hate him because he was late, the Republicans hate him because he did this, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=229.0s)]
*  but I just think, is it true guys that they're going to file the report anyway? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=233.5s)]
*  Yes, final report. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=235.5s)]
*  So he's going to get a final say, he's going to put that, hey, this is what I would have tried him on, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=237.5s)]
*  and he's going to go, okay, go read it, everybody, and then we're going to have something else to talk about and debate afterwards. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=241.5s)]
*  And then, Donald Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=247.5s)]
*  I'm so sorry, but why are we doing that? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=249.5s)]
*  Yet again, this is another example, the case has been dropped, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=251.5s)]
*  and we're going to take legal documents, evidence, that they allege evidence, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=255.5s)]
*  and put it out there for the fear when it hasn't been prosecuted yet. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=261.0s)]
*  Well, because DOJ has got that policy, you can't prosecute a sitting president, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=265.0s)]
*  but we're probably going to see all this stuff, Brian, not only in the final report, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=269.0s)]
*  but if they do go ahead and prosecute Walt Donata and the other guy, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=272.0s)]
*  who were involved in, they say, obstruction of justice down in Mar-a-Lago, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=277.0s)]
*  then we'll hear the whole case. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=282.0s)]
*  The question is, why would the Department of Justice go after that, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=284.0s)]
*  knowing that the president will then have pardon power, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=287.0s)]
*  I'm just going to pull the plug on both those cases. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=290.5s)]
*  Think about when they went through Melania's drawers, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=293.5s)]
*  when they went through her closet, her underwear, whatever. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=295.5s)]
*  We had to pay that person, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=298.5s)]
*  You had to pay everyone who went to Mar-a-Lago in that raid. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=300.5s)]
*  So this money all included, Brooke went through it, but the employee, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=304.5s)]
*  not only salaries, but rent, computer services, support, transcripts, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=307.5s)]
*  then also bodyguards for Jack Smith. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=312.5s)]
*  How much was Jack Smith getting paid? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=315.5s)]
*  It's almost like if you get a blank slate, if it's the government's money, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=318.0s)]
*  just spend it, who cares? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=321.0s)]
*  It's not my money, I'm just going to spend and spend and spend. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=323.0s)]
*  When you look at these totals, Newsweek did a great job of breaking it down [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=326.0s)]
*  from November 18th in 2022, two years ago, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=330.0s)]
*  just until the following March, they spent $5.4 million, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=334.0s)]
*  a little bit more than that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=339.0s)]
*  Then they break it down for the next set of months, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=341.0s)]
*  between April 1st and September 30th, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=344.0s)]
*  and direct and indirect spending, $15 million. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=346.5s)]
*  Then between October 1st and this past March 31st, they spent $6.6 million. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=349.5s)]
*  I mean, you read these numbers, it's a lot. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=355.5s)]
*  And who did it serve? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=358.5s)]
*  Here's a big number. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=359.5s)]
*  No one can call it back. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=654gpmsB0Yk&t=360.5s)]
