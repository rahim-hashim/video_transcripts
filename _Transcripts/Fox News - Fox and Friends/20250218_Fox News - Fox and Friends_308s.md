# 'Performative' anti-DOGE protests blasted by BLM leader
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8)

*  Go, Bees, go, Pirates! [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=33.08s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=35.08s)]
*  Our next guest calls it the Democratic cult that he was once a part of, the executive [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=36.08s)]
*  director of Black Lives Matter, Inc., Mark Fisher. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=40.32s)]
*  Mark, good morning, brother. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=43.08s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=44.44s)]
*  So the last... [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=46.32s)]
*  Hey. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=47.32s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=48.32s)]
*  I was going to say good morning to you and the whole Fox and Friends crew, Lawrence. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=49.32s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  So the last election, you saw Black voters, you saw Latino voters, you saw young people, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=53.68s)]
*  either stay at home or vote for Donald Trump and reject this agenda. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=59.4s)]
*  So why are the Democrats out there singing in the streets, doubling down on the same [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  message? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=70.12s)]
*  Democrats are desperate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=72.56s)]
*  I would say it's the closest thing to a national cult that we have. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=73.56s)]
*  And when you are overwhelmingly beat with a mandate and swept across all branches of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=76.8s)]
*  government, you basically have nothing else. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=85.28s)]
*  And that's the playbook is just protest Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=87.52s)]
*  But I believe Americans are tired of protests now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  And the Democrats offer nothing but protests. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=94.44s)]
*  So they just need to just lick their wounds and give Donald Trump and his administration [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  a chance to do what the people voted him in to do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=101.36s)]
*  So Mark, as someone that used to be a Democrat myself, you used to be a Democrat, I'm sure [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=104.44s)]
*  there are some folks in the audience wondering why you decided to change. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=108.52s)]
*  What was it within the party, in the movement that you said, OK, I can't take this anymore? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=112.92s)]
*  I think that the Democrats are experts at taking advantage of the most vulnerable and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=121.12s)]
*  weak-minded people in society. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=127.16s)]
*  I was there and I did it, you know, at one time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=128.88s)]
*  And then when they're done with you, you're no longer, they no longer have any use for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=132.4s)]
*  you, you become disposable. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=137.6s)]
*  And they're doing the same thing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=139.0s)]
*  They did it with the Black people and they did it with the immigrants, the legal immigrants, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=141.0s)]
*  they do it with LGBTQ. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, and so, you know, the protests, the last thing they want to do is give you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  something that's going to help you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  But they allowed Black Lives Matter to protest because they know we needed an outlet somehow [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=156.0s)]
*  or some way. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=160.72s)]
*  But they never met any of the demands, they never gave us anything, it was bait and switch. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=161.72s)]
*  They never kept any of their promises. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=165.56s)]
*  And that's what they're good for. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=167.08s)]
*  So this is what the movement is saying in a statement. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=168.76s)]
*  The 50-51 movement does not refer to an organization. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=171.96s)]
*  It represents a vision, the American Dream, as we were all once taught to believe in it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=176.32s)]
*  This is not just a movement, it is our modern-day civil rights struggle. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=181.8s)]
*  So I was told that the American Dream was to work hard. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=186.16s)]
*  And if you work hard, you get a good-paying job and you get to take care of your family. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=189.52s)]
*  We're seeing the American Dream being robbed from people, though. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=195.64s)]
*  Our tax dollars have been spent on foreign governments when our people are struggling. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=198.48s)]
*  Money going to illegals. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  Folks of our generation can't afford a house. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=205.76s)]
*  Our education system is going nowhere. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=207.56s)]
*  How is this the American Dream? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  And not only that, now they're being exposed for the largest fraud probably in the United [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=212.6s)]
*  States history vis-à-vis USAID, along with, you know, a plethora of other, you know, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=217.12s)]
*  crimes against the country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  And they're just being exposed for it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=228.76s)]
*  But these protests, they're all performative. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, in my state, in Rhode Island, it was going to be a dozen, a couple dozen people [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=232.2s)]
*  out with some signs and stuff. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=235.48s)]
*  And I think it's interesting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  To me, it smells of the George Soros playbook. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  And I'm not going to mention any names, but this is kind of the playbook. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  And it's interesting to me the day of the protests that were scheduled by online demonstrators [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=248.0s)]
*  for the 5th and the 17th, I think. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=255.36s)]
*  A couple days before that, they had the scheduled protest for illegal immigration in several [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=258.64s)]
*  strategic cities across the country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=266.04s)]
*  So this is just them, you know, being, you know, sore losers and sour grapes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=268.24s)]
*  Yeah, sore losers, sour grapes, and the same old things that people rejected in the last [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=273.48s)]
*  election. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=280.4s)]
*  I'm all for competition, so I want them to be able to regroup and present a vision for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=281.52s)]
*  the American people that we can get behind so there can be healthy debate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=286.2s)]
*  But we're not getting debate. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  We're getting singing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  And I don't think a lot of folks back home are going to resonate with that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  Brother, thanks so much for coming on the program this morning. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gOkjr5tzK8&t=294.76s)]
