# Mike Rowe: This is the year the other shoe drops
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI)
*  Meanwhile, there's a growing shortage of car mechanics, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=0.0s)]
*  and that is fueling concerns across the country. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  This, as a new report reveals, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=6.58s)]
*  the auto industry could see more than 67,000 [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=8.18s)]
*  open jobs per year. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=11.48s)]
*  So joining us now to talk about it is Mike Rowe [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=13.18s)]
*  from Mike Rowe Works Foundation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=15.5s)]
*  He's the CEO, and we are so happy to have you on, Mike. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=17.82s)]
*  You get your hands dirty. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=21.88s)]
*  I love Mike Rowe Works, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  because you are a worker, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=24.92s)]
*  and you do so much for other people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Why is this? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=27.94s)]
*  Why don't people want to be mechanics? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=28.78s)]
*  Well, I mean, the honest answer is a 300 page book. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=31.42s)]
*  I can't get around to finishing, but I'll tell you this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=34.54s)]
*  I'm not one to say I told you so, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=37.22s)]
*  but 10 years ago, I sat on your set. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=38.7s)]
*  You did. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=41.1s)]
*  10 years ago this month, and I said, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=41.94s)]
*  look, this conversation usually involves employers [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=43.94s)]
*  who are struggling to find people who want to do the work [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=47.3s)]
*  and individuals who could benefit their lives [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=50.06s)]
*  by learning a skill that's in demand. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=52.56s)]
*  In the next decade, it's going to expand [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=54.64s)]
*  to impact the 300 million or so people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=57.14s)]
*  who depend on this part of our workforce. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=59.58s)]
*  This is the year the other shoe drops. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=63.38s)]
*  The American submarine industrial base [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=66.18s)]
*  is looking to hire 100,000 tradespeople [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=68.42s)]
*  over the next eight or nine years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=70.78s)]
*  The automotive industry has their back [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=72.74s)]
*  against the wall in the same way. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=74.62s)]
*  The reason is super complicated, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  but it has a lot to do with the stigmas and the stereotypes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=79.14s)]
*  and the myths and the misperceptions [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=82.86s)]
*  that surround opportunities in these careers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  So at Mike Bro Works, we've been at it for 16 years now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=88.54s)]
*  We award work ethic scholarships, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  and we try and make a more persuasive case [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=93.2s)]
*  for a lot of great six-figure jobs [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=95.56s)]
*  that don't require a four-year degree, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=97.5s)]
*  like the ones you're talking about this morning. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=99.62s)]
*  That's right, and Mike, you mentioned four-year degree, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  four years of college. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  I think early on, we're all indoctrinated with, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=106.26s)]
*  if you're going to be successful, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=110.12s)]
*  you've got to go to college, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  and so many people go to college [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=112.88s)]
*  and they wind up graduating without a degree [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=114.44s)]
*  in something they can make money at. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  You go into something like this, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=119.88s)]
*  and you will learn your craft, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=122.06s)]
*  and then you will be able to do it your entire life. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=124.6s)]
*  And at the end of the day, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=126.94s)]
*  you will have done a good job and gotten a good paycheck, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=129.06s)]
*  and enough people don't realize [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=133.18s)]
*  it is an honorable profession. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=134.92s)]
*  Sure, look, I mean, that's a great point, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=137.64s)]
*  and Ainsley's, I think a better answer to your question, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=139.76s)]
*  Ainsley, is that we have embraced a kind of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=143.76s)]
*  cookie-cutter approach to education [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=147.32s)]
*  and workforce in our country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  And we didn't do it on purpose, but it just happens. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=152.28s)]
*  We're talking to, what, a couple million people right now, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  and the temptation is to say something [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=157.48s)]
*  that applies to everyone equally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=159.44s)]
*  But that's not the world that we live in. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=162.6s)]
*  There are many millions of parents with kids [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  who simply aren't best served [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=166.72s)]
*  by pursuing a four-year degree. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=169.2s)]
*  Doesn't mean a four-year degree's bad, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=170.92s)]
*  it just means it's not for everybody. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=172.68s)]
*  Same is true with careers in automotive. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=174.56s)]
*  We have to step back from the bromides and the platitudes [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  and try and take a more nuanced approach [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=182.58s)]
*  to where the opportunities actually are. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=184.44s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=186.88s)]
*  I can't believe they can, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=189.04s)]
*  I didn't know six-figure salaries in mechanics, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=189.96s)]
*  that's great. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  I guess- All day long. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=192.92s)]
*  And you don't have to own the auto, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=194.12s)]
*  the shop. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=196.52s)]
*  Just work for somebody. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Just work for someone. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=198.18s)]
*  Mike- Well, you just have to work. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=199.02s)]
*  I mean, we're raising money every single day [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=200.28s)]
*  to train the next generation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=204.6s)]
*  Steve, I know we've talked about it, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  we're auctioning off a one-of-a-kind truck right now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=208.52s)]
*  And all the benefits come to my foundation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=212.0s)]
*  It's gonna be a huge deal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=214.2s)]
*  Barrett Jackson is doing this thing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=215.76s)]
*  My buddies up at Sugar Creek [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=218.04s)]
*  built this half a million dollar truck. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=219.6s)]
*  There it is, we just unveiled it at SEMA. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=222.52s)]
*  Wow, it's massive. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=224.64s)]
*  I don't know what it's gonna sell for, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=225.72s)]
*  but they say seven figures, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  and all the money goes to recruiting efforts [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  in the skilled trades, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=231.16s)]
*  with an emphasis toward the careers we're talking about here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=232.6s)]
*  It's a beast. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=236.04s)]
*  So if people wanna bid, how do they do that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=236.88s)]
*  Well, you get rich, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=239.92s)]
*  and then you come to Barrett Jackson's auction in January, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=241.04s)]
*  but you can go to my website now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=245.16s)]
*  There's so many ways to help out with this endeavor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  It's microworks.org, and we're open 24-7. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  That's so nice of Barrett to do that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=253.04s)]
*  Mike, thank you very much. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61-Xm0VgZaI&t=255.48s)]
