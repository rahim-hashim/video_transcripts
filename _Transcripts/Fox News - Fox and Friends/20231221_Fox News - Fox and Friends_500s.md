# Hamas rejects 7-day truce in exchange for hostages
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM)
*  All right, Israel says it is nearing the end of its ground offensive in northern Gaza after weeks of heavy fighting as the IDF works to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=0.0s)]
*  Dismantle Hamas the terror group has reportedly rejected Israel's offer of a week-long truce in exchange for the release of 40 hostages [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=7.4s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv with the latest hatred [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=16.26s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys good morning, I do want to start with some breaking news right now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=20.92s)]
*  Sirens are sounding in central Israel just south of the city of Tel Aviv Hamas 76 days into this conflict [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=24.76s)]
*  Still has an arsenal of rockets. They are using to target major population centers [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=31.6s)]
*  It also comes as Hamas has publicly rejected Israeli discussion of a possible ceasefire [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=36.42s)]
*  Saying that no hostages will be released until the war is officially over now while Hamas is saying one thing publicly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  They're saying something else privately just yesterday [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=48.36s)]
*  Ismael Hani had the leader of Hamas flew to Cairo Egypt to continue conversations about a possible deal [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=51.22s)]
*  It comes as Israeli forces say they are close to completing the high-intensity ground operations in northern Gaza [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=57.44s)]
*  Much of the focus for soldiers over the past day has been in the Jabalia neighborhood where the Israelis say troops from the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=63.62s)]
*  551st Brigade [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=70.18s)]
*  Evacuated a group of civilians still in a building with more difficult ground fighting taking place in southern Gaza [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=71.58s)]
*  The death toll is rising among Israeli troops with a total of a hundred and thirty seven killed since the ground operation began [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=77.26s)]
*  Those battles come as activity continues to increase on Israel's northern front overnight Israeli strikes against southern Lebanon [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=84.28s)]
*  We're more serious after new attacks by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah attacks against American forces [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=90.94s)]
*  Also increasing across the Middle East in both Iraq and Syria a rocket attack overnight against the Al-Assad airbase [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=96.34s)]
*  Did bring the total number of a hundred and two attacks against the US forces across the region since the middle of October [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=103.08s)]
*  The entire region though remains on the brink of a broader conflict [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=110.6s)]
*  And that's part of the reason that the United States put together this coalition to push back against Iran backed actors in Yemen [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=113.96s)]
*  Trying to send a clear message to Iran and its allies that force will be used to stop this fire against Israel and the United States [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=120.52s)]
*  Guys [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=128.08s)]
*  So I'm pretty astounded they're still able to shoot off rockets and I imagine with the drone technology [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  They're able to find out exactly where they came from. So it might be the last time they do it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  I guess from that site, but I understand one of the one of the captures one of the prisoners [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  His name is Ahmed Khalout the manager of the guys. So just if you Brian I'm gonna interrupt you here [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=143.84s)]
*  You can hear there's siren sounding now in Tel Aviv. So we're just gonna take a little bit of cover here and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=150.32s)]
*  We can keep talking I [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  mean, this is just the reality of right now and just [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  Just so you know the Rockets that are coming in right now. They don't have detection. They don't know where they're going [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=162.56s)]
*  They have no clue where they're aiming at. They just shoot them off [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=168.96s)]
*  But the Iron Dome does right how I absolutely how often do you hear those sorts of sirens in Tel Aviv? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  It's quite rare to have them in Tel Aviv this far into the conflict again [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=178.92s)]
*  We are 76 days into the war the Israelis have dropped more than 20,000 bombs on the Gaza Strip [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=183.64s)]
*  They've been targeting Gaza since October 7th [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=190.0s)]
*  And yet they've maintained the ability the factions inside Hamas and Islamic Jihad to fire rockets toward major [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=193.2s)]
*  Population centers you hear the sirens sounding we can look down to the street people are coming off the beach right now [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=199.92s)]
*  They're coming away from the Mediterranean Sea trying to take cover [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  This is a city of more than 300,000 people and despite the heavy air and ground campaign against Hamas and Gaza [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  They have maintained their ability to fire on major cities like Tel Aviv. Yeah, and you see the construction site evacuating [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  They're going right down the ladder right now. Just a just quick thing what I was saying is that this this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  Hamas leader that was captured was on television [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=229.92s)]
*  Iron Dome coming up here guys did you just if you focus here? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=232.64s)]
*  You're gonna be able to see there's a there's gonna be a bunch of interceptions right overhead pan up to the sky here duty [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=235.92s)]
*  Up to the sky you're gonna see all of this smoke one two three four five six seven eight nine [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=242.76s)]
*  Ten eleven this is a massive barrage [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=249.64s)]
*  Toward Tel Aviv and you're gonna continue to hear these explosions overhead each time one of these rockets [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=253.56s)]
*  Overhead each time one of these rockets is intercepted you have shrapnel raining down into the city below [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=260.32000000000005s)]
*  But again, this is one of the largest rocket barrages against Tel Aviv that we have seen in quite some time [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  And trade they'll hear those explosions. This is all civilians to this is the target of civilian. There's been so much [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=273.72s)]
*  You know propaganda that Israel is targeting civilians in Hamas [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  And and the Palestinian people that are there but look at what they're doing right now [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=286.6s)]
*  Absolutely and the bottom line here is that they have no ability to aim these rockets [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=295.44000000000005s)]
*  And so Israel's missile defense system the Iron Dome can intercept much of the fire. It's actually quite effective [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=301.0s)]
*  This conflict it's been anywhere between 85 and 95 percent [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=308.68s)]
*  Effective but in terms of the damage that these rockets can do we've seen it firsthand [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=312.92s)]
*  If one of these rockets slams into a building [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=318.56s)]
*  It can very easily kill civilians in a city like Tel Aviv in the early days of the conflict [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=321.36s)]
*  You saw when that massive barrage of thousands of rockets targeted Tel Aviv and all of Israel [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=326.24s)]
*  These rockets slipping past the Iron Dome and slamming into buildings killing people [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=331.96s)]
*  Wow, and so these aren't fireworks as they've been described by some people. These are [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=336.36s)]
*  Rockets that were that were [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=340.8s)]
*  Ultimately created inside Gaza. They have the ability to fire [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=344.44s)]
*  Rockets that they've actually made in the strip often underground in the facilities inside Gaza and they continue again [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=348.68s)]
*  76 days into the conflict targeting major population centers [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=354.88s)]
*  Quick exit question for you unless Brian you have another one, but [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  What you just said about people inside Gaza making their own rockets is interesting [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=363.16s)]
*  And I was wondering because we are set like you said 76 days into this war if [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=368.04s)]
*  How they are able to have this amount of supplies and artillery? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=372.48s)]
*  Is Iran also able at this point to get weapons? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  Into the Gaza Strip or I guess because Gaza is still surrounded. Maybe that's not an option [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  So they're relying on [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  homemade weapons [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  Yes, so the majority of the rockets that are being fired are homemade inside Gaza and they've received funding and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=394.32s)]
*  Support from the Iranian regime, but there's no way at this point to smuggle any new weapons into Gaza [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=401.32s)]
*  So what's being fired today and what you just saw live on air here these interceptions over Tel Aviv [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  These are rockets that were built in the Gaza Strip. They got the knowledge from places like Iran [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=412.0s)]
*  They have these weapons manufacturing facilities that aren't able to only control the weapons [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=417.8s)]
*  Rockets, but also things like RPGs and IEDs that are being used against Israeli forces on the ground [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=423.68s)]
*  Hamas is even able to create sniper rifles and the ammunition used to target Israeli troops inside Gaza as [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  We speak and so they have the ability to create their own weapons arsenal because they get funding from outside actors like Iran [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=437.6s)]
*  they get knowledge and support from the regime in Tehran and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=444.6s)]
*  This is something that they've spent the last 16 years developing even more than that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=448.2s)]
*  and it and it just really gives you an idea of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=452.68s)]
*  The threat that was coming from Gaza and how they really only used a small [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=455.96s)]
*  Portion of the arsenal that they developed over the past several years on [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  October 7th when they conducted the massacre against southern Israel and they are really running through the rocket supply [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=465.04s)]
*  Understanding that Israeli forces are going to destroy every single launching position inside Gaza. It's simply a matter of time [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=470.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=476.82s)]
*  Really get the sense why the Israelis cannot stop until they complete the job or else [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=477.12s)]
*  This is going to be a daily routine and if they just slow them down, we'll be back here in 18 months [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=482.52s)]
*  Trey, thank you. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fHSrAjIEM&t=488.4s)]
