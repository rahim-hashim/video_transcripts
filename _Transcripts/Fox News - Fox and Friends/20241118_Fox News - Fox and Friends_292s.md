# 'Take a seat': Dems reportedly fed up with Pelosi
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E)
*  If you go right now to the New York Post website, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=0.0s)]
*  the lead story is all about Nancy Pelosi. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Miranda Devine has written a great op-ed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=9.08s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is finished. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  No one deserves more blame for the Dems' [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=13.22s)]
*  $1 billion electoral collapse than her. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=15.48s)]
*  Keep in mind, she's the one who stabbed Joe Biden [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=19.36s)]
*  in the chest, and essentially, he had to walk the plank. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=23.96s)]
*  So she is the reason Kamala Harris was the nominee, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=28.48s)]
*  and she is the reason, according to so many people, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=32.78s)]
*  that they really stunk up the place this election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=38.96s)]
*  Pelosi told the New York Times [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=41.8s)]
*  that President Biden should have dropped out, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=43.16s)]
*  dropped his re-election bid earlier, and that if he had, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=44.84s)]
*  Democrats might have had the opportunity [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=47.84s)]
*  to run an open primary, and that led to this headline, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=49.08s)]
*  Axios' headline says, scoop, House Dems sick of Pelosi, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=52.2s)]
*  and one senior House Democrat that was interviewed says, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  quote, she needs to take a seat. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=60.36s)]
*  Yeah. Right. By the way, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=62.0s)]
*  how disrespectful it is for the singing speaker, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=63.24s)]
*  Keem Jeffries. He's the one who should be front and center. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=66.26s)]
*  He's the one who should be given explanations, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=68.7s)]
*  excuses, and setting up a mission, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=71.4s)]
*  and he said that a member of the Congressional Black Caucus [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=73.68s)]
*  said this, I don't think she, Pelosi, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=75.92s)]
*  is being respectful of him, Jeffries. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=78.84s)]
*  Now, Jeffries was asked that specifically on Sunday [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=82.08s)]
*  on Meet the Press, listen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=85.32s)]
*  Very quickly, though, do you think she's undermining [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=88.36s)]
*  your leadership with her public pronouncements? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=90.44s)]
*  No. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  Okay. That was quick. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  One of the arguments that Nancy Pelosi made [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  is that President Biden [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=99.96s)]
*  should have gotten out of the race sooner. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=101.72s)]
*  Do you believe he should have dropped out sooner? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=104.66s)]
*  I think that President Biden will go down in history [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=110.0s)]
*  as one of the most consequential presidents of all time, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=113.08s)]
*  and I was thankful for all the work [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=115.48s)]
*  that we were able to do together. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=117.6s)]
*  He did make the decision. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=119.48s)]
*  It was a selfless decision to pass the torch [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=120.64s)]
*  to Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=123.56s)]
*  I think she ran with it and did the best job that she could [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=124.92s)]
*  under incredibly challenging circumstances [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=128.44s)]
*  in a little over 100 days. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=131.32s)]
*  She came close, but we fell short. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=133.2s)]
*  I'm not telling the truth, because Joe Biden said [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=135.56s)]
*  it would take God Almighty to pull him out of the race, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=138.24s)]
*  and then he went on a two-week rally binge, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=141.16s)]
*  as well as doing about four network interviews. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  If Biden wanted to finish this out [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=146.96s)]
*  and was maybe not told the truth [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=148.92s)]
*  or lying about his own polls, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=151.32s)]
*  but Nancy Pelosi said, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=153.48s)]
*  when the guys didn't step up, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=155.04s)]
*  meaning Obama and Clinton, I had to go out and do it, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=156.4s)]
*  and then they finished the job. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=159.8s)]
*  Maybe it started with George Clooney, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=161.04s)]
*  but he's not being honest. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=162.68s)]
*  I know he's in a hard spot, and they get along, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=164.24s)]
*  but that's something. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=167.4s)]
*  I think the one thing that she did not figure out, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=168.56s)]
*  she's the most overrated politician of our generation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=171.0s)]
*  Remember, this is the woman who classlessly tore up [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=173.56s)]
*  the State of the Union address that the whole world watches [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=176.76s)]
*  as if that was, and she couldn't do it, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=180.56s)]
*  she had to do it one at a time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=182.12s)]
*  So that's when she lost it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=183.68s)]
*  And she was asked in her own daughter's documentary, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=184.84s)]
*  she said, I should have put more National Guard troops [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=188.44s)]
*  there on January 6th. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=192.08s)]
*  She doesn't even bring that up again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=193.6s)]
*  Well, ultimately, Joe Biden has not been in good shape [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=195.08s)]
*  for a year and a half or two years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=198.24s)]
*  He should have stepped aside for the country, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=201.0s)]
*  and now for the party. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=204.68s)]
*  And she and other top Democrats saw him [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=206.32s)]
*  with their own two eyes and let this happen, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=210.04s)]
*  and then eventually she stabbed him in the chest, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=212.52s)]
*  as I said a moment ago, but it was too late. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=215.72s)]
*  And she wanted an open primary. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=217.48s)]
*  I think she knew in her heart of hearts [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=218.96s)]
*  that Kamala Harris wasn't the right one for the job. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=220.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=222.84s)]
*  Well, you would have to have, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=223.68s)]
*  Joe would have had to back out long before [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=225.0s)]
*  to have an open primary. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=227.52s)]
*  They wanted to have a jungle primary [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=228.68s)]
*  and have an old fashioned convention. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  In six weeks. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=231.28s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  That's putting everyone's name in a hat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  And then they would have lost all the money [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  that Joe Biden had, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  the only person that could keep that money [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  was the vice president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=238.56s)]
*  And she- [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=239.56s)]
*  Because her name was on the ticket. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  What I think has come out is that her goal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  was to make it open primary. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=244.04s)]
*  She had everything right until Joe Biden says, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  I'm endorsing the vice president. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=247.76s)]
*  That stopped her plan in its tracks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  And they were stuck with somebody [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  with 32% approval rating who can't retain a staff [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=253.48s)]
*  and doesn't understand policy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=256.68s)]
*  and is too lazy to read it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=258.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=259.76000000000005s)]
*  I think he said, fine, Nancy, you're pushing me out. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=260.6s)]
*  George Clooney, you're pushing me out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=262.6s)]
*  Barack Obama, you're pushing me out. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, then I get to choose the candidate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=266.24s)]
*  and it's gonna be my vice president. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=267.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's why everyone believes [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=269.8s)]
*  that he voted for Trump, Joe Biden. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, people are speculating that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  is why for the red pantsuit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=275.92s)]
*  And he wore a Trump hat. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  Or he left it blank. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0797LSOQa6E&t=279.72s)]
