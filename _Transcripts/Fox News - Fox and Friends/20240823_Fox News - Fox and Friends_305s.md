# Police arrest Arizona man who threatened to kill Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4)
*  All right, the action does not stop today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Trump will address voters in Glendale, Arizona. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=5.82s)]
*  Yesterday he went to the border himself and met with families of migrant crime victims, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=9.18s)]
*  including the mother of Rachel Moran, the 37-year-old mom of five who was murdered in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  June. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=19.06s)]
*  We're going to end up being a third world country if it continues this way. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=20.06s)]
*  And I hope, truly I hope that you will just take my words to heart because it's devastating [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=25.46s)]
*  to lose a child. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=33.84s)]
*  This is a very, very important issue and it's one that's either going to make or break our [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=35.18s)]
*  country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=41.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  Pinal County Sheriff and former US Senate candidate Mark Lamb will speak tonight as [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  a special guest at Donald Trump's rally. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=47.7s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=50.02s)]
*  How important was that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=51.28s)]
*  Mr. Trump going to the border yesterday and bringing Mrs. Moran with him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=54.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's super important, Brian. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=57.48s)]
*  This is going to be the number one issue as we go into November. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  And I think this is Kamala Harris's number one weakness as well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=63.2s)]
*  And I think bringing these angel moms and parents on there to talk about the reality [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=67.5s)]
*  of what the border crisis is, whether it's fentanyl poisons, but in this case, heinous [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=72.44s)]
*  crimes, horrific crimes against American citizens, rape, murder. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=77.88s)]
*  I think that people need to hear it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  This is what needs to happen for us to be able to get the right person in office. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  And Kamala is not the right person. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=88.84s)]
*  So Sheriff, people say, well, you know, on average, they say the numbers say that illegal [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  immigrants don't commit more crimes than the average American. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=95.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=97.44s)]
*  I don't think it should. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=98.44s)]
*  We're splitting hairs for the wrong reason. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  The fact is we shouldn't be dealing with any illegal crime in this country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=103.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=106.92s)]
*  Because we should have stopped them at the border. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=107.92s)]
*  This is what they want to do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=109.88s)]
*  Oh, well, Americans commit more crimes than illegals do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=110.88s)]
*  We shouldn't be talking about any illegal crime. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=114.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  And especially when they were caught and then they were released into our public and not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  sent back to their respective countries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=123.16s)]
*  And now we have the numbers of the border are stunning. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=125.06s)]
*  There was over 1200 on the Biden administration under Trump, his total four years, 246,000 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=127.38s)]
*  plus for Harris. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=134.16s)]
*  There are over 392 percent increase under them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=136.44s)]
*  They want to say, well, we had we had bipartisan reform and Donald Trump walked away from it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=139.98s)]
*  and it was the best reform ever. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=147.1s)]
*  And the Border Patrol OK'd it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  What does Sheriff Lamb know about that reform? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, I had to sit through Kamala Harris's thing last night because I knew I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  was doing these interviews. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=157.66s)]
*  So I took one for the team and listened to that garbage last night. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  But one of the things she brought up is that Trump said don't pass that bill. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=162.54s)]
*  Look, ultimately, senators decided not to pass that bill. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=166.38s)]
*  But I'm glad they didn't because it wasn't a border bill. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=169.84s)]
*  It was a global assistance bill, first and foremost. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  And the 20 billion they did have going to the border was not designed to fix the problem. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=175.18s)]
*  It was designed to treat the symptoms. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=179.56s)]
*  They had two point three billion dollars going to NGOs who are currently aiding and abetting [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=181.5s)]
*  and funding trafficking of humans. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=186.4s)]
*  They had another nine plus billion dollars going through the State Department to the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=188.12s)]
*  UN for global migration. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=192.8s)]
*  We don't need to continue to finance it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=195.46s)]
*  Not to mention they wanted to codify into law 2500 people a day for seven days straight [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=197.36s)]
*  before they would do something about it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, my co-parts sheriff Grubb Judd out in Florida said the acceptable number, if [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=205.4s)]
*  you can stop it at 2500, you can stop it at zero. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=210.72000000000003s)]
*  And that is the acceptable number for Americans. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=213.36s)]
*  Sheriff, you heard about the manhunt yesterday. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=215.56s)]
*  There was a guy who wanted to kill President Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  He was wanted for DUI and child molestation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  You got him? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  We got him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=227.24s)]
*  You know, I talked to Sheriff Downs just about 20 minutes after they got him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=228.24s)]
*  They heard about this guy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=231.84s)]
*  They went into action immediately. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=233.96s)]
*  They were able to, they almost caught him one point and they were able to track him [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=235.68s)]
*  down not long after President Trump's speech there at the border. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  But they did take that guy into custody. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  You know, this is the type of people that the left's rhetoric continues to motivate [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=244.8s)]
*  to do heinous things. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=249.38s)]
*  This is what happened, what we saw in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=252.0s)]
*  We're lucky we didn't see it there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=255.12s)]
*  Good job by the Sheriff's Office down there taking this guy into custody. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=256.34s)]
*  But this is what we're going to continue to see if the left continues with this messaging [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=260.26s)]
*  and what we saw from Kamala last night. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=264.17999999999995s)]
*  All right, Sheriff, thanks so much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=265.94s)]
*  And hopefully you'll try to run for office again because you do a great job explaining [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  your side of the story and what you would do. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=270.34s)]
*  Sheriff Lam, thanks so much. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=272.38s)]
*  Thank you, Ryan. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=273.73999999999995s)]
*  Hey, be well. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=274.73999999999995s)]
*  Coming up on One Nation, Saturday night, 9 o'clock. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=275.73999999999995s)]
*  I want you to join me. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  Tony Robbins is going to talk about child trafficking. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=278.78s)]
*  Brand new movie coming out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  You're not going to believe it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  You knew it on what happens next, as well as Douglas Murray, who offers awards after [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=283.18s)]
*  the DNC in a sarcastic tongue in cheek way and Glenn Greenwald on the press. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=288.02s)]
*  Lovin Kamala. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_HnuVOeLX4&t=292.94s)]
