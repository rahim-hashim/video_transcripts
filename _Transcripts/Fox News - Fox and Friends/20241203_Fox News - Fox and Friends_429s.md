# 'STOP!': Charlamagne goes off on Dems after Hunter pardon
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI)
*  So Charlamagne the God made news maybe for the first time outside his very successful show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=0.0s)]
*  I thought when he was interviewing Joe Biden and he said, you know if you don't but he asked him a tough question [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=6.0s)]
*  Biden didn't like it. He said well, you know what if you don't vote for me, you ain't black [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=11.08s)]
*  He's like what and you saw him take a dose. Excuse me [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=14.84s)]
*  Yeah, Joe by when he was vice president [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=17.8s)]
*  So since that time he made it clear too that he wasn't gonna vote for Joe Biden this time [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  and then Kamala Harris who they've been friends with when she was a DA or [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=24.78s)]
*  Attorney General out in Florida [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=30.12s)]
*  California when she won in he won all in no doubt about it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=33.04s)]
*  He also expressed your grin when he saw Joe Biden who he knows called Joe called [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=35.8s)]
*  Donald Trump Hitler and a fascist that would ruin the country and end all elections shaking hands and explaining pleasantries in the White House [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=42.08s)]
*  And now his surprise continues to grow he's wondering how sincere were you when you said that and now he's wondering too [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=49.84s)]
*  After the pardon do I have to rethink entirely the entire party right because Joe Biden was emphatic [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=57.78s)]
*  He was not going to pardon Hunter Biden his son. We all knew he was gonna Charlemagne knew he would but nonetheless [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=64.58s)]
*  He had a great soundbite yesterday Charlemagne did and we're gonna play it for you about how [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  Essentially Joe Biden has blown up his own party [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=78.54s)]
*  Democrats can't say you're the ethical party anymore after what Joe did to all of us [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=81.86s)]
*  watch [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=87.30000000000001s)]
*  Hunter Hunter was singled out because he broke the law [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=89.14s)]
*  He was singled out because he had an illegal gun and tax evasion charges not because he was the president's son [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  And I just want Democrats to stop acting like they are on this moral high ground [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=95.54s)]
*  Politically when they have shown us they're not you know [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=98.86s)]
*  Whether it's skipping the primary process when Biden stepped down and things like Biden pardon is pardoning his son [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=101.26s)]
*  Stop acting like y'all to pure party and Republicans aren't and it also shows me elected officials can do whatever they want as long as [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=105.94s)]
*  They have the political will and courage to do it [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if he was convinced he was gonna pardon him because Joe Biden kept saying obviously over and over he's not gonna pardon [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=115.5s)]
*  I think the bottom line is though is that they ran an entire election based on norms and that Donald Trump was gonna destroy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=121.34s)]
*  all type of know if you got him back in office then democracy was in peril and that he was gonna overturn the Department of Justice and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  to run your campaign on saving democracy and protecting the Department of Justice and to now have [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=136.78s)]
*  The sitting president not only pardoned his son from criminal activity that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=143.66s)]
*  many people argued that he's linked to but then to double down and say that the Department of Justice is a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=148.94s)]
*  Political arm as well his Department of Justice [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean he's using Donald Trump's talking point after campaigning against [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=157.38s)]
*  Donald Trump's camp talking point and I think that's what Charlemagne is pointed to now. Don't get me wrong Charlemagne is a progressive [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=162.98s)]
*  He's gonna be team Democrat throughout the election [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=169.62s)]
*  But once the election is over or before the election [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=172.62s)]
*  Then you'll see him [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=176.5s)]
*  Criticize the party and tell them things they need to check themselves on well [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=178.34s)]
*  I think what we heard from Democrats the entire election the reason I one of the reasons I think Donald Trump did so well is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=182.58s)]
*  Because they told us how much we should hate Donald Trump and how what Donald Trump was saying was completely false that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=189.14s)]
*  The DOJ was not being was not being weaponized for political reasons and that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=196.66s)]
*  How could you say that you're against women's bodies? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=202.5s)]
*  No women love women's bodies men love women's bodies [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=207.22s)]
*  But we also love babies and many of those babies are in these women's bodies [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=211.66s)]
*  So we were tired of being told you're wrong [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=215.5s)]
*  And that's what he I think he means with the moral high ground y'all are so much y'all are y'all are garbage [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=218.14s)]
*  Y'all are deplorables y'all shop at Walmart [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=224.86s)]
*  You don't understand what it's like to live in New York what it's like to live in, California [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=227.68s)]
*  No, most people are proud of the fact that they don't love to live in New York or California [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=232.1s)]
*  I think America got tired of hearing the Democrats and Oprah and all the people at the DNC telling us how much they hate Donald Trump [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=236.98s)]
*  We heard Donald Trump's name probably just as much as Kamala's at the DNC. Wait, but to to Charlemagne's point [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=244.5s)]
*  He was talking about how Democrats have been talking about we've got the moral high ground. We got it. We got it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=249.98s)]
*  We got it until Joe screwed it all up [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=254.64s)]
*  there's an op-ed in the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=257.02s)]
*  New York Times today of all places here's the last line of it and it regards [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=265.14s)]
*  11th hour pardon of his son the New York Times writes what a degrading finale for Biden's feeble [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  forgettable [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=273.7s)]
*  frequently foolish [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=274.7s)]
*  Presidency well, that's the New York Times, but here's the deal. They're still sticking with it [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=276.34s)]
*  I was I was I was watching a clip of the view yesterday and Alyssa fear who maybe she wants to be a Republican again [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=280.62s)]
*  Was criticizing the Democrats now and say look he lied Biden lied [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=287.52s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and what be looks at her and response there and goes be careful with their word lot. I mean what? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=292.56s)]
*  What are we supposed to call it? He changed his mind [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=300.0s)]
*  Let's just be careful with this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=304.2s)]
*  I'm gonna just say I have something profound to say and okay, it's gonna be really important that I owe you [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=311.04s)]
*  Here it is. Yes [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=315.96s)]
*  For the longest time everyone said what's gonna happen the Republican Party with Donald Trump's gone [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=317.96s)]
*  It's all about Donald Trump. And I think that the Republican Party said to themselves. Yeah one point. Yeah, you're right [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=321.6s)]
*  Instead the party has a bunch of people that want to continue with Donald Trump's doing the real problem is the Democrats [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=327.04s)]
*  Democrats, what are you gonna do when you when your whole party is based on fighting Donald Trump? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=332.86s)]
*  And you lose yeah, and you lose on ideas you lose with demographics and you lose in the battleground states and he gains in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  149 of 50 states even in urban areas and everything that you've been saying has been disproven and unheard by the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=343.4s)]
*  uneducated masses [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=350.84s)]
*  So Democrats ironically will have a harder time getting over Trump than Republicans [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's why I believe other networks are trying to give Trump a chance [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=357.32s)]
*  Because they try not giving a chance and only thing they lost was viewers. Yeah, the Democrat brand is broken right now [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=361.12s)]
*  They've got to figure out something new and exciting [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=367.88s)]
*  Because right now the the shiny thing is Donald Trump he's already a rain arranged a brand new [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=370.96s)]
*  Cabinet he's ready to go on day one already getting some results from his threats with terrorists and whatnot [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=377.76s)]
*  So the Democrats they're in a hole right now and Joe Biden [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=384.56s)]
*  Made the hole a little deeper, right? I thought my comments were so profound [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=388.44s)]
*  We might even go to break right and I thought to be silence and you guys back [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=392.0s)]
*  I can't right now rule you go to a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=395.92s)]
*  Lastly right let's do that. We will say they were really profound. Yes for another hundred dollars. All right [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=398.64s)]
*  50 we're gonna be filthy rich [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=406.32s)]
*  I never have cash [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=408.76s)]
*  See that's a 50 [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=410.88s)]
*  I'll take that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=413.2s)]
*  That was profound by the way, what you say very much. I'm Steve juicy [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8xF2akryI&t=415.56s)]
