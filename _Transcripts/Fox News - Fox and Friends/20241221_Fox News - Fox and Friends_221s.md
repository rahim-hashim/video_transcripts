# Peter Doocy: This backfired on Biden
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4)
*  We have a process in place to manage migrants at the border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=0.0s)]
*  We're working to make sure it's safe and orderly and humane. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=2.84s)]
*  Sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=6.28s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  We've now gotten control. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=10.28s)]
*  Are you committed to making sure that the troops stay [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=12.08s)]
*  until every American who wants to be out is out? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=14.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=18.04s)]
*  Wages for working families have gone up, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=18.44s)]
*  while inflation has come down 65%. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=20.32s)]
*  Will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=22.68s)]
*  no matter what it is? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=26.88s)]
*  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=28.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=30.4s)]
*  And we certainly know that none of that came to pass, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  and particularly the pardon, at the end of that clip montage. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=36.8s)]
*  I'm also reminded of when he made the speech and said, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=39.56s)]
*  we are not going to have people in Afghanistan hanging [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=42.92s)]
*  from the embassy roof and trying to get them out, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=45.16s)]
*  saying that when we withdraw soldiers from Afghanistan, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  everything is going to run smoothly. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=51.84s)]
*  Boy, was he wrong on that, too. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  And another thing that I notice about that clip montage [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=55.32s)]
*  is we were playing clips from 2021 and 2022. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=58.28s)]
*  How greatly over this past four-year period [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=61.84s)]
*  that his voice has even changed, and how diminished [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=64.44s)]
*  he has become while in office. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=68.08s)]
*  And going back to that Wall Street Journal reporting, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=70.88s)]
*  even though it's more evident now in how he speaks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=73.44s)]
*  and how he sounds, and there are issues with him [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=76.8s)]
*  taking stage instructions on where to go, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=79.4s)]
*  White House staffers were even worried about it in 2021. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=82.2s)]
*  At the start of the presidency. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  They brought in Hollywood pros to deal with the voice [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  that you're talking about, the diminishing voice, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=88.64s)]
*  which I know you heard up close and personal. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Listening to Joe Biden's voice has been my life's work [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=93.76s)]
*  for the last six years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=96.76s)]
*  And what I think about when I watch this, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  and especially the stuff about Afghanistan, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=100.28s)]
*  the day of the Abbey Gate bombing, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=101.92s)]
*  I was in a press conference, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=104.48s)]
*  it was still kind of socially distanced, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  and I asked him a question, something to the effect of, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  do you bear responsibility for this? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=110.76s)]
*  And he turned it around on me at the time, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=112.8s)]
*  asking questions about some deal [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=116.44s)]
*  that Trump and Mike Pompeo had negotiated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  In the moment, it was all about Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  And it was an entire campaign and an entire administration [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=125.2s)]
*  that they made about things they thought Donald Trump [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=130.76s)]
*  had done wrong, and look where that got him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  That's so true. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=137.2s)]
*  But what a missed opportunity, Peter, to your point [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  about Karine Jean-Pierre not receiving a single question [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=140.44s)]
*  on this Wall Street Journal reporting, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=143.44s)]
*  because she was up there for the past four years [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=145.16s)]
*  saying that everything is fine, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=147.8s)]
*  and when we saw videos of him wandering around [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=149.68s)]
*  and not knowing how to exit a stage, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=153.72s)]
*  they were called cheap fake videos. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=155.12s)]
*  So I am curious to see how the White House would respond [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=157.24s)]
*  to this legitimate 50 person sourced reporting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=160.24s)]
*  about how deeply their concerns were. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=163.6s)]
*  And I tell you what, if Caroline Levitt, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  in a month, was at the podium, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  and there was this Wall Street Journal story [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=169.8s)]
*  with 50 people familiar with Trump's operation, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  that there was this big cover-up [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  to try to conceal diminished faculties, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=176.36s)]
*  that would be every single question. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=180.8s)]
*  It would be every question. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  And it's not like the White House press corps [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=184.56s)]
*  doesn't have it in them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=185.8s)]
*  We did a whole briefing this summer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  where there were an hour worth of questions [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  about some Parkinson's specialist [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=190.8s)]
*  who kept coming into the White House. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=192.52s)]
*  Ultimately, they kind of cited HIPAA. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=194.24s)]
*  We didn't get many answers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  But it's not like it hasn't been a source of curiosity. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=198.08s)]
*  I truly, I wish I had answers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  I can't get in their heads. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=204.24s)]
*  Sometimes I would like to. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  Most of the time I don't. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  We'll send you back to keep trying to get them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_tIPkrYI4&t=208.92000000000002s)]
