# Hosts shocked as blue city steps up resistance to ICE deportations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk)
*  One person that is getting high praise is Tom Homan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=0.0s)]
*  You saw the president on the CPAC stage saying Tom Homan is killing it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=3.36s)]
*  And part of the reason Tom Homan has is escalating his rhetoric. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=7.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's killing it in a good way. That's right. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=10.96s)]
*  I forgot sometimes I use young people. I should use more diverse language for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=14.08s)]
*  everybody. Am I calling him old? Not just yet. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=19.36s)]
*  Middle age. He said earlier he's just average. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=22.96s)]
*  That's all I ask. I'm a senior. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  But he's getting high remarks from the president because he thinks he's doing a good job. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=28.4s)]
*  But Tom Homan is upset because there are some cities not abiding by federal law. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=32.8s)]
*  And he bossing this one. Look at this guy who the cops went after. ICE arrested him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=37.76s)]
*  And he's smiling. He's a gang member from Brazil, known, wanted, and not taking it seriously. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=43.44s)]
*  I think he will once he's in Guantanamo. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=49.92s)]
*  So he was convicted of assault and battery against a Massachusetts resident back in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=51.84s)]
*  September. Sentenced to one year in prison, but then released after three months because [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=55.52s)]
*  the city is ignoring the ICE immigration detainer. And the police commissioner is not cooperating [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=61.2s)]
*  with ICE. Right. So here is President Trump touting [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=66.72s)]
*  the crackdown on immigration. Even though he wants more criminals picked up, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  he's happy with the border, with the sealing of the border and the crackdown across the country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  The fraudsters, liars, cheaters, globalists and deep state bureaucrats are being sent packing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=79.76s)]
*  The illegal alien criminals are being sent home. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=88.64s)]
*  We're draining the swamp and we're restoring government by the people, for the people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=92.4s)]
*  We're liberating communities like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=97.2s)]
*  that have been occupied by illegal alien criminals from all over the world. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=104.64s)]
*  We're rescuing the Americans whose jobs have been stolen, whose wages have been robbed, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=109.84s)]
*  and whose way of life has been absolutely destroyed. I have to clean up the mess. I'm [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=116.56s)]
*  cleaning up the mess and it is a mess on the border with inflation. To go over every single [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=121.36s)]
*  thing he touched turned to ****, okay? Everything. It's colorful, but it's true. And if you look at [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=128.16s)]
*  all these major cities now, you've got all of these people that are essentially aiding [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=137.68s)]
*  the cartel and the criminal enterprise because you've got these gang members and these criminal [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  aliens that are in these apartments or in these homes and ICE is showing up with all the rest of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=146.24s)]
*  the feds and they're essentially on bull horns letting them know that they're there. Now, if a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=151.52s)]
*  drug dealer did this on the south side and was a call out boy for another drug dealer, they would [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=156.08s)]
*  be jammed up in charge of a accessory, helping and aiding with them. But these guys aren't being [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=162.08s)]
*  jammed up. So Tom Homan is saying, look, I'm contacting Pam Bondi at the Department of Justice [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=166.8s)]
*  to see where the line is and we're going to start jamming up some of these activists. They're saying [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=171.84s)]
*  it's free speech, but you're giving, your free speech is aiding criminals. When you're speeding, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  if someone's coming the other way, they flash their headlights at you to slow down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  That could get you fined. So this is something much more serious. So Tom Homan was fired up [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=185.68s)]
*  and he talked about some of the struggles he's having with these blue run cities where a lot [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=192.24s)]
*  of legals call home, especially Boston. Listen. I'm coming to Boston. I'm bringing hell with me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=198.16s)]
*  Nine child rapists that were in jail in Massachusetts, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  were rather than honoring an icy tater, released them back into the street. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=213.52s)]
*  You're not a police commissioner. Take that badge off your chest, put it in the desk drawer, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  because you became a politician. You forgot what it's like to be a cop. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, can he explain that the commission explained why you let child predators back on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=229.6s)]
*  the street instead of just turning them over to ice? That makes absolutely no sense. But we're in [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=234.72s)]
*  the process, the judge comes in, in New York City. I don't know what they're doing in Boston and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=239.68s)]
*  always makes these serious crimes misdemeanors and then lets them out with almost no bail, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=244.08s)]
*  the no cash bail law. And then the cops got to go pick them up again. And after a while they go, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, what am I bothering for or why do we want to do this job? So one city council member, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=252.72000000000003s)]
*  the Susan Durkin said, I understand that Tom Homan spent his career as a federal agent within [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=257.2s)]
*  border patrol and ICE, but that's a world away from the realities of policing in a major city. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=262.32s)]
*  His background is in immigration enforcement, not community policing. What are you talking about? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=266.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? First of all, you're a big cop. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=271.92s)]
*  Message to Susan and to all the people who live in Boston that support the sanctuary city [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  ridiculous rules. These are child rapists. That's the worst. That is evil. You will be punished by [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=278.96s)]
*  God one day because of that. That is evil. It is so wrong. And to defend them and let them out early [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=285.44s)]
*  so that they can be back on the streets and do it again, they ruined lives. Those lives will never [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  be the same. Those are heinous, evil crimes. And so I don't understand how a city council person [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=295.76s)]
*  can defend or this police officer or the commissioner can defend these criminals. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=301.36s)]
*  I know it happens in New York every day. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwMJPZ-bIk&t=307.44s)]
