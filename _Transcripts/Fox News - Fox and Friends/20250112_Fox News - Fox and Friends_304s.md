# Palisades family uses pool pump to fight fires
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc)
*  With high winds set to return and new evacuations now ordered, crews raced to contain the Palisades [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=0.0s)]
*  fire as the blaze rages on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=7.04s)]
*  And as hydrants ran dry, one Pacific Palisades family got creative, making their own firefighting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=10.0s)]
*  equipment out of their pools, generator to fend off some of the flames, and they saved [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=14.96s)]
*  their home. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=19.32s)]
*  Those residents, Patrick and Evan Gawling, join us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=20.32s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=23.96s)]
*  So explain to us how this all came about. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=25.2s)]
*  How did you all, was it just sort of a last minute, immediate thing, or was this something [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=27.62s)]
*  you had thought about before? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=32.38s)]
*  Hi there, good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=33.86s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  Well, I have to say that we have to give all the credit to our father, who about three, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  four months ago was so adamant about having one of these for fire season. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=47.34s)]
*  It seems like every summer or every fall during the Santa Ana winds, we always have a high [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=53.3s)]
*  fire risk here and we know that going into the season. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=59.94s)]
*  And this season he just, he had a feeling. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=63.94s)]
*  He said we have to be a little better prepared. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=66.14s)]
*  And there's no doubt in my mind that the setup that we had was what saved our house. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  I believe that's Patrick talking to us now, so I'll turn to Evan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=76.5s)]
*  If I've got you guys situated and organized correctly in my mind here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=80.78s)]
*  So Evan, can you give me some context though? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=84.5s)]
*  Like how did the homes around you burn? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=86.62s)]
*  How close did the fire get to the home that you guys saved with pool water? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=90.38s)]
*  Yeah, so actually our backyard caught on fire as well as a bunch of our neighbors and right [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=94.3s)]
*  across the street the house completely burned down. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=100.54s)]
*  And so I was actually having to rush back from school the same day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  And so when I got there I had FaceTime my brother and they set the generator up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=109.5s)]
*  But right across the street where the house burned down, our neighbor's house was super [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=114.38s)]
*  close to the fire so we had to wheel the generator all the way across the street and set it up. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=119.7s)]
*  And that's actually his backyard and we like basically saved a bunch of houses with this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=124.66s)]
*  one equipment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=129.44s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=130.44s)]
*  It was definitely life saving, yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=131.44s)]
*  I'm amazed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=134.02s)]
*  Patrick, explain to me, how did your dad know about this idea? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=135.02s)]
*  I'm still kind of trying to wrap my head around it, this pump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=139.38s)]
*  You know that's a good question. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=144.26s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=145.54s)]
*  He asked me one day to, he said he wants to get a pump that goes out of his pool. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=146.54s)]
*  And so we found somebody online, a nice gentleman who came over to the house and gave a demonstration [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=151.22s)]
*  and showed us exactly what he recommends for our particular setup. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=156.1s)]
*  So we actually have a generator that powers a pool pump and you have a splitter so you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=160.66s)]
*  have one big sprinkler that you set up in place and you let it run, you kind of angle [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=168.14s)]
*  the direction that you want and it goes back and forth. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=174.1s)]
*  And then also a fire hose, an individual hose so you can manually go around. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=177.14s)]
*  So I think that was just the best setup for what we had and you know clearly, really the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=181.9s)]
*  guy who came over and set it up for us, I mean he was very spot on with what he gave us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=189.94s)]
*  So how much of your pool water did you end up using? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=195.78s)]
*  We ended up using all of our pool and then the following day when we came back, we actually [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=200.62s)]
*  brought it to the neighbor's house just upwind a little bit and we drained pretty much their [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=207.9s)]
*  entire pool. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=213.82s)]
*  So what we ended up doing is we ended up dousing our big palm tree and the shrubbery next to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=215.58s)]
*  the house and their backyard and then we would drive around the neighborhood, go check [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=221.86s)]
*  on the neighbors, we'd come back in about an hour, turn the generator off, go in, fill [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  it with gas again, do the same thing, check on the neighborhood, check on family, friends [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=232.5s)]
*  houses and we did this about four times. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=238.26000000000002s)]
*  So in total, our generator and pump ran for about five hours and doused everything that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=242.38000000000002s)]
*  we could. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=249.94000000000003s)]
*  I hope everyone in your neighborhood buys some of these things. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=251.02s)]
*  I hope they buy one of these things and I hope they buy you a drink. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=253.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's an amazing story. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=256.54s)]
*  Not just your own home. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=258.54s)]
*  Well, not Evan. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=260.54s)]
*  Well, maybe Evan. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=261.54s)]
*  How old are you Evan? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=262.54s)]
*  I'm 17. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=263.54s)]
*  Okay, no drinks for Evan. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=264.54s)]
*  Bring him cookies. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=265.54s)]
*  Maybe a soda or something. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=266.54s)]
*  Yeah, a soda. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=267.54s)]
*  You guys represent the American can-do spirit and also a sign that LA is not doing its job [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=268.54s)]
*  when people have to get these kinds of contraptions in their homes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=278.54s)]
*  And a model for what people can do when they are prepared. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=284.62s)]
*  Preparation is possible. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=285.62s)]
*  Patrick and Evan, thank you guys so much for being with us this morning. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsv2-kXsBc&t=286.62s)]
