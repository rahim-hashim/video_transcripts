*  the lights. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=59.02s)]
*  But what did you think of last room was you think I thought [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  it was great. I thought you know it was for the Catholic Church [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=63.96s)]
*  really and for a lot of good people a lot of good causes and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=66.62s)]
*  unusually she didn't show up you would have thought you would [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=69.9s)]
*  have shown up last night you were surprised we're all [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=72.2s)]
*  surprised. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=74.2s)]
*  But they told me it's only teleprompter for the comedian. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=75.66s)]
*  I said give me the committee. No, no, I didn't get so I had [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=79.6s)]
*  to do it sort of like right and I liked it better. I think I [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=82.46s)]
*  liked it better. But you know when I when I went they I said [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=85.16s)]
*  is this a teleprompter speech and I had a pretty long speech [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=89.14s)]
*  and they said so we don't use teleprompter then I get up there [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=92.14s)]
*  to see the committee and he was good too by the way. Jim [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=94.64s)]
*  Gaffigan's fun. I thought he was you know Kamala Harris did not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  show up as you know she sent a video from Saturday Night Live. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=100.72s)]
*  You know we have seen historically a lot of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Democrats they turn to the guys at Saturday Night Live or the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  David tonight show they write all their material your material [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=110.5s)]
*  is real funny who wrote it who helped you with. Well, I've had [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=113.2s)]
*  a lot of people helping a lot of people a couple of people from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=115.48s)]
*  Fox actually shouldn't say that but they wrote some jokes and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=117.98s)]
*  for the most part I didn't like any of them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=121.12s)]
*  To see some highlights of the degree. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=124.62s)]
*  Roll take Catholic Church helping the poor educating [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=131.46s)]
*  children and supporting the vulnerable. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=133.86s)]
*  But if you really wanted vice president Harris to accept [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=137.64s)]
*  your invitation, I guess you should have told her the funds. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=140.44s)]
*  We're going to bail out the looters and riders in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=145.22s)]
*  Minneapolis and she would have been here guaranteed you would [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=148.38s)]
*  have been. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=151.16s)]
*  It's a true pleasure to be with you this evening. Amazing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=157.66s)]
*  pleasure. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=160.6s)]
*  And these days it's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=161.66s)]
*  really a pleasure anywhere in New York without a subpoena for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=164.6s)]
*  my appearance. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=168.6s)]
*  Any time I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=170.42s)]
*  But unfortunately, governor Walz isn't here himself, but [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=177.48s)]
*  don't worry. He'll say that he was he's going to say. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=180.72s)]
*  But I have to be careful, however, to understand that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=188.56s)]
*  this will be the first time in the history of this event. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=191.5s)]
*  We're jokes will be fact checked and they will be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  all polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=199.2s)]
*  vote [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=202.2s)]
*  as I should be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=203.4s)]
*  as I should be. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=205.2s)]
*  But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. She hasn't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=207.54s)]
*  instead of attending tonight. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  She's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=212.44s)]
*  That's the president. You had a balance because you're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  you got to tell these jokes, but you're sitting next to people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=225.32s)]
*  that don't like you at all. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=228.06s)]
*  You know, I know very well, I guess he doesn't like but he [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=232.46s)]
*  likes me enough. It's it's a little bit it's hard to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=235.3s)]
*  explain. You know, I gave him his first check when he was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=238.3s)]
*  young, I was young. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=241.24s)]
*  It was his first check. I don't know is that good or bad, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=242.8s)]
*  but it was the first check that he ever got he was running for [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=245.24s)]
*  I think assembly up in New York and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=248.0s)]
*  you got it from me so so we should blame you for the rise. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=251.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's all I for the feeling. New York, what did [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Mayor Adam say to you because you were young. I mean, he's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=259.08s)]
*  Democrat, you're Republican, but you can relate because of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  the subpoenas letisha James she was in the back row, the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=265.12s)]
*  weaponization now I said it's look I've been investigated [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=267.98s)]
*  more than Alphonse Capone I say, but Adams he came out against [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=272.92s)]
*  the immigrants, you know against the destruction of New York [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=276.82s)]
*  Franklin, it did the right thing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=279.66s)]
*  I said he will be indicted within 6 months. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=281.56s)]
*  And he was they indicted him. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=284.42s)]
*  Now, I don't know if it's legit. I haven't looked at it, but it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=286.62s)]
*  seems very suspicious when he when he comes out against [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=289.32s)]
*  something that they're destroying the country. They are [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=292.22s)]
*  destroying our country. He was right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=294.56s)]
*  I go down the streets of New York. I went down the streets [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=297.02s)]
*  of New York 2 days ago and I'm looking at migrants all over [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=300.66s)]
*  Madison Avenue all over 5th Avenue. I've never seen [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=303.86s)]
*  anything like it. I'll tell you I've never this is New York. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=306.94s)]
*  You see empty stores. You never saw empty stores on Madison [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=310.4s)]
*  Avenue. You never see him. It's a shame. He did the right [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=313.3s)]
*  thing, but he got indicted and they play weaponization. These [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=316.68s)]
*  are an evil group of people. These are really a bad group of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=320.54s)]
*  people. I'm doing well with my stuff. I won in Florida. I [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=323.54s)]
*  won. I'm winning all over the place. But you know what they [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=326.48s)]
*  want to do is keep him busy. Let me spend plenty of money [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=329.22s)]
*  fighting it and let him maybe. But I think so far it's back [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=332.16s)]
*  for it because the public understands the win in Florida. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=335.62s)]
*  That was the big case. That was the case. Oh, you're going to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=338.5s)]
*  lose. Now he actually lost because he had documents, but he [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=340.56s)]
*  didn't have the presidential documents case in Florida. It [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=343.9s)]
*  was a documents case. I was like they say the big one. I don't [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=346.14s)]
*  know what's the big one, but the big ones and we had a very [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=348.88s)]
*  brilliant judge, a very fair judge and I won the case. I [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=351.44s)]
*  won the whole thing. He didn't win. They said he was grossly [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=355.34s)]
*  incompetent and based on that they're not going to charge him. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=358.96s)]
*  But the funny is he can be president, but he can't go to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=362.72s)]
*  court. They say he can't go to court because he's incompetent. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=366.8s)]
*  So he can't go to court. So that's OK, but he's allowed to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=369.56s)]
*  be president. So there's something wrong with our [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  country when that when that happens. But I thought last [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  night's Eve. I thought last night was great. I think it was [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=379.56s)]
*  terrible that she missed it because it's only been one [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  person missed it in many years. And that's Walter Mondale. He [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=385.14000000000004s)]

*  President? Why do you think she missed it? There's a lot of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  theories. OK, I think that she's not competent. I don't want to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=394.44000000000005s)]

*  I don't think she's funny. I don't look at her staff. She's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=401.88s)]
*  got five percent of her staff stayed with her. Ninety five [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=405.08s)]

*  every nobody likes her. Nobody wants to be with her. And I [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  always say this. I don't like even saying it, but we can't [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=414.82s)]
*  have her as a president. She's a Marxist. We're not ready for a [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=417.8s)]
*  Marxist. Do you agree with that? I do agree with you. And I think [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=420.96s)]
*  the Marxist. Yeah, let me ask you this. And she's not very [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=423.9s)]
*  good. Let's face it. Closing argument time because we're only [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  two and a half weeks until the election. So this is the final. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=429.62s)]
*  This is it. So she realized joy, joy, joy. That's not working for [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=433.96s)]
*  them. Now they've they've changed it. They now they're [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=438.4s)]
*  ramping up their rhetoric. And when she sat down with Brett [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=441.5s)]
*  Bear, she said, talking about you, he's unstable. When she was [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=444.09999999999997s)]

*  unstable and unhinged. And then in this new ad that they've [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=451.94s)]
*  rolled out, she's saying unhinged, more unstable and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=454.85999999999996s)]

*  the God, his breakfast club show, this caller says, I have a [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=461.44s)]

*  And she says, yeah. So you've hit on a really important point. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=473.58s)]
*  What is your response? And what is your closing argument? Well, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=477.58s)]
*  first of all, the question is pretty rough question because, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  you know, you're giving this whole argument of this woman [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=483.36s)]
*  that I don't think she knows where she is. She's a low IQ [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=486.65999999999997s)]
*  person. She's not smart. Everyone knows that didn't even pass her [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=490.26s)]
*  law exam. It was a big thing. She never thought she was going to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=494.4s)]
*  be able to pass it. You know, you tell me this stuff, I'll say [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=496.74s)]
*  it. I am a person that they are a threat to democracy. These [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=500.28s)]
*  people are misinformation people. They'll say, let's go [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=506.12s)]
*  out with this one. They've tried many different things. They [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=508.78s)]

*  it hasn't worked. I guess that's the attack they have for this [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=517.28s)]
*  week. It doesn't seem to be working. I am the most stable [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=519.86s)]

*  had four years of greatness. We had the greatest economy in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=531.44s)]
*  history. We had the greatest border. Brian, you were down [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=534.64s)]

*  history of our country. There's never been anything like it. I [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=540.4s)]
*  built 551 miles of wall, which is far more than I said I was [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  going to build when I campaigned. I had a border where [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=547.42s)]
*  the drugs were at the lowest level, the human traffickers in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=550.18s)]
*  women. They trafficked in women. Everything was at the lowest [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=553.02s)]
*  level. I got kudos from the border patrol gave me with [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=555.96s)]
*  thousands of people, unanimous, every single one. They endorsed [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=560.76s)]

*  gaining with minorities. I've been going across the country [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=568.04s)]
*  to these barbershops. Yesterday, you said you wanted [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=570.24s)]
*  to go. So we went to the Bronx yesterday. Here's a little bit [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  of what we saw at the barbershop. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=576.34s)]
*  You guys are the same as me. It's the same stuff. We were [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=579.54s)]
*  born the same way. I grew up in Queens and all of that. I mean, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=582.48s)]
*  you know, it's a I had a great father. I had a father was a [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=587.02s)]
*  great guy. He was tough, but good. Big heart, big, big heart. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=589.98s)]
*  And he was a construction guy pretty much and a real estate [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=594.86s)]
*  guy. And I learned a lot from him. He was great. But I know [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=598.38s)]
*  you people so well without knowing you. I know you so well. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=602.44s)]
*  When I walked in here, I said, this is this is home territory. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=605.82s)]
*  So, Mr. President, we're going to play the full thing on [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=610.0600000000001s)]
*  Monday. But what was that experience like? There was so [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  much love in the room. It was like people that I grew up with, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=615.32s)]
*  actually, you know, all different types, everything [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=618.7s)]
*  perfect. The area was incredible. The traffic, the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=621.7600000000001s)]
*  there were thousands and many thousands of people standing [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=624.84s)]
*  outside this barbershop. The owner was great with the son. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=627.98s)]
*  The son is actually the owner. He's already made that passage. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=631.06s)]
*  But the the people were fantastic. We could have stayed [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=633.66s)]
*  there for two hours, right? It was great. Why do you think [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=637.06s)]
*  they're giving you a shot? They haven't voted for Republicans [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=639.76s)]
*  and years like this. So what is what are you doing on the ground [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=643.0s)]
*  differently? Yeah, attracting black men, Hispanic men. I just [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=647.14s)]
*  saw a Hispanic pole or I'm at 52%. Nobody's ever seen that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=650.9399999999999s)]
*  before. Republicans never been there before. I'm at 52%. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=654.38s)]
*  And with black men, I'm at 32% and 31%. This is sort of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=657.78s)]
*  throwing their formulas off a little bit. You know, this is [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=664.24s)]
*  a little bit of a change. But look, we ran a great country. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=667.78s)]
*  We had everything going. The world respected us. We had no [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=671.5799999999999s)]
*  wars. This group will cause us World War Three. They have no [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=674.68s)]
*  idea what they're doing. And, you know, I hate to talk that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=678.12s)]
*  way, but we can't let this woman get in. It's two people and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=681.06s)]
*  she's a very and you talk about unstable. She's a whack job. And [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=684.52s)]
*  how about his? How about the vice president? How about Waltz? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=687.66s)]
*  I mean, he's not qualified to be doing this. He is. I mean, you [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=691.98s)]
*  have to look at the vice president very seriously and you [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=695.8199999999999s)]
*  compare him and J.D. Vance, J.D. Vance, number one at Yale, you [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=698.36s)]

*  interview at the White House when you were after you were sworn [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=725.74s)]

*  handle the big proportion? It is a huge proportion. How do you [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1217.66s)]
*  handle the next portion? Okay, then we see that a lot of come [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1220.7s)]
*  in here. But then we start thinking, okay, then we start [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1224.24s)]
*  thinking because, you know, look, you're talking about [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1227.3799999999999s)]
*  millions of people. You talk about 21 million people in three [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1230.56s)]
*  years. Just so you know, they will let this happen. If they [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1233.3999999999999s)]
*  win the election, they're going to open up the border and the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1237.02s)]
*  border is going to be open for four years. You'll have 200 [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1239.8s)]
*  million people come in. We have no idea. They tend to be not the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1243.34s)]
*  best for a reason because the countries send them out. The [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1247.58s)]
*  countries are not sending their best people. I've been saying [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1251.08s)]
*  this for a long time. They're not sending your original. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1253.74s)]
*  Your very first speech, you said they're not sending in the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1256.08s)]
*  best. So when a country sends people out, they're not saying, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1258.32s)]
*  hey, let's take our best people and send them to the U.S. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1262.26s)]
*  They're sending their rapists. They're sending their [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1264.86s)]
*  murderers. We have a big cut. Look at what's happening in [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1270.36s)]
*  Springfield, Ohio. Look at what's happening, though, in [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1274.28s)]
*  Aurora. Aurora is amazing. Do you know there are many [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1277.04s)]
*  auroras right now, but you haven't heard about them? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1279.58s)]
*  San Antonio. We just interviewed a man running for Congress down [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1282.18s)]
*  there. He said this is happening at an apartment complex down [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1284.76s)]
*  there. It's only going to get worse. So let's talk about when [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1287.06s)]
*  you look at the positives. By the way, they're destroying a [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1289.7s)]
*  country. I know. I know they took over Randall's Island. The [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1292.8600000000001s)]
*  kids can't even play soccer. They just took over. I looked at [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1297.3s)]
*  it. I'm telling you, I drove down Madison and the first time [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1300.38s)]
*  I've ever seen vacant stores and I see migrants from foreign [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1302.94s)]
*  countries, the people that came in, they're sleeping all over [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1306.94s)]
*  the streets. When you look at your positives, obviously with [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1309.98s)]
*  men, it's through the roof. You're making gains in Hispanic [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1312.54s)]
*  blacks. I understand that. But when the doors close and the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1314.68s)]
*  team sits around you, they say, Mr. President, you've got to do [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1317.8600000000001s)]
*  better with women. That's where Kamala Harris is excelling with [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1321.32s)]
*  women. Is one move to get women on your side is to get Ivanka [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1325.7s)]
*  out, Malani out, and especially Nikki Haley out in these final [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1330.54s)]
*  18 days. Is that something that's coming out of your [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1334.1s)]
*  strategy session? Look, I think I do very well with women and I [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1336.44s)]
*  think it's all nonsense. I see the polls and we do well. What [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1339.54s)]
*  about the Nikki Haley? You have one issue. You have the issue of [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1342.12s)]
*  abortion. Without abortion, the women love me. Now, they like me [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  anyway because what I've done is so good. I've taken this issue [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1347.7199999999998s)]
*  out of the federal government and put it back to the states [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1351.02s)]
*  where they're voting. And I believe in exceptions and most [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1353.4199999999998s)]
*  people do for rape and all of, you know, rape, incest, life of [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  the mother. But I've done so and I think I've taken an issue. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1359.7399999999998s)]
*  So could I amend my question? Let me just say that issue has [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1363.7399999999998s)]
*  torn our country apart for 52 years. No legal scholar, no [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  Democrat, Republican, no liberal concern wanted it to be in [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1371.3s)]
*  Congress. They wanted it to be out of the federal government. I [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1375.68s)]
*  got it out through six very brave judges who were also [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1379.6399999999999s)]
*  brilliant. And now they're voting. Ohio voted and it's [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1383.96s)]
*  actually a very liberal vote. Kansas, very liberal vote. But [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1388.62s)]
*  people are voting. They wanted it to be in the states and a vote [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1391.8999999999999s)]
*  of the people. But that issue, maybe some women, but they're [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1395.36s)]
*  going to find... I'm going to do a subset of that question. Well, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1399.78s)]
*  the country's coming together now over that and they're [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1402.52s)]
*  getting to vote. They're actually voting on the issue. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1405.46s)]
*  There's a segment of the Republican Party that likes [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1407.66s)]
*  Nikki Haley and they are reluctant to jump into your [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1411.26s)]
*  column. She wants to help. She said, if he calls me, I'm there. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1414.16s)]
*  You guys used to be tight. In the last 18 days, will you call [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1417.9s)]
*  her and say, come out with me? Yeah, I'll do what I have to do. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1422.24s)]
*  I'll do what I have to do. Let me just tell you, Nikki Haley [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1425.26s)]
*  and I fought and I beat her by 50, 60, 90 points. I beat her in [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1428.3600000000001s)]
*  her own state by numbers that nobody's ever been beaten by. I [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1434.56s)]
*  beat Nikki badly. I beat everyone else too badly. I beat... I [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1437.9s)]
*  mean, frankly, I set records both in speed and in the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1442.2s)]
*  magnitude of the win. And everybody keeps saying that. They [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1447.3400000000001s)]
*  don't say get Ron and Ron did very well. But again, I beat [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1450.5800000000002s)]
*  everybody by numbers that have never happened before. And they [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1455.08s)]
*  keep talking about Nikki, Nikki. I like Nikki. Nikki, I don't [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1459.5s)]
*  think should have done what she did. And that's fine that she [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1463.58s)]
*  did it. But even in her own state in South Carolina where [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1466.78s)]
*  she was the governor, I beat her by a number that nobody ever [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1470.48s)]
*  heard of, by 50 points or something. And then they say, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1474.62s)]
*  oh, when is Nikki coming back in? Nikki is in. Nikki is [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1477.6599999999999s)]
*  helping us already. But it's just people keep saying, when [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1482.72s)]
*  you bring... They don't say when you're bringing this one. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1487.48s)]
*  Everybody is in. And Nikki is already in. You know, she's [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1489.48s)]
*  out competing. And Elon Musk is... Look, I watched a rocket [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1492.5600000000002s)]
*  ship land four days ago. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1496.92s)]
*  That was stunning. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1498.96s)]
*  I watched a rocket ship. You talk about people. This guy is [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1499.8600000000001s)]
*  unbelievable. I was on the phone. I'm talking to somebody [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1503.7s)]
*  on the phone, and I'm half falling asleep. An important guy, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1506.3400000000001s)]
*  but a very boring guy. And I'm like this. And the television [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1510.26s)]
*  is sort of like the sound is off. And I see this mess of [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1514.0s)]
*  like 20 stories. You know, things like 20 stories tall. And [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1517.4s)]
*  I'm looking. I thought it was a space movie or something. This [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1520.8400000000001s)]
*  guy is so brilliant. And I watch it come down. And you can see [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1524.28s)]
*  it's still in good shape, but it's burned to hell because it [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1528.6200000000001s)]
*  was traveling at 10,000 miles an hour. You know, so it's like [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1531.18s)]
*  a piece of fire. And it's coming down. And I said, oh, man, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1534.0800000000002s)]
*  that's going to crash into the gantry. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1537.16s)]
*  This is not good. Right. Right. And I said, well, and then I [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1538.74s)]
*  see the two arms grab it. And it's like perfect. I said, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1542.78s)]
*  that could only be Elon. I call. He said that was me. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1546.38s)]
*  Think of it. This guy is campaigning. He is actually [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1549.46s)]
*  campaigning for me in Pennsylvania. He thinks that my [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1552.8200000000002s)]
*  winning and a lot of people love him. I mean, he is you know [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1556.46s)]
*  what he did with that Starlink, how he helped North Carolina. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1560.0s)]
*  It was huge. And Georgia. I mean, they had no [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1563.16s)]
*  communication. I was there. He had it there in record time. I [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1565.7s)]
*  called him. I said, could you do they asked me, do I know him? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1568.94s)]
*  Yes, I know. He gave me the nicest endorsement really of [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1571.3400000000001s)]
*  anybody. So having his endorsement meant a lot. So, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1574.38s)]
*  Mr. President, we got some viewer questions. They wanted to [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1576.98s)]

*  school choice. You know, that's one of the biggest things on my [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1701.5800000000002s)]

*  to move, get it out of Washington. If you look at our [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1706.76s)]
*  schools, we spend more per pupil than any other country. Norway, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1710.14s)]
*  Sweden, Denmark, I hate to say this, China, can you believe? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1716.18s)]

*  more per pupil than we're moving everyone, we're moving it all [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1726.8200000000002s)]
*  out of Washington and we're going to let the states run the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1730.66s)]
*  schools. You give the schools to Iowa, they're going to be [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1733.76s)]
*  another Norway. It's going to be great. You give them to so many [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1736.46s)]
*  different states, Indiana, they're dying to do it. They can [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1739.32s)]
*  do it for less than half and you will have those states [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1743.16s)]
*  competing with the best. Department of Education. Every [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1746.2s)]
*  building in Washington, you go by Department of Education. I'm [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1749.54s)]
*  going to have one person working there, maybe with the secretary. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1753.64s)]
*  I don't mean a secretary. You want it all to be local now. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1756.48s)]
*  The way we do it is we want to make sure that they're teaching [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1760.24s)]
*  English, right? Let's say reading, writing, and [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1762.8600000000001s)]
*  arithmetic. Not transgender, we're not going to be having [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1766.64s)]
*  that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1769.18s)]
*  What about our history? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1769.98s)]
*  All of that. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1771.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, the key about school choice is there are a [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1772.18s)]
*  lot of people who would love to be able to take the money that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1774.54s)]
*  they put into taxes and put it into a different school. Not the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1777.18s)]
*  public school, but the Catholic school, the private school. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1781.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1784.46s)]
*  So Mr. President, we've got to question that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1785.5600000000002s)]
*  And you're on board with that. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1787.94s)]
*  School choice is one of the most important things we're going to [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1789.04s)]
*  be doing. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1791.6799999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1792.78s)]
*  Because we have the worst. Think of it, out of 40, we're [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1793.8799999999999s)]
*  number 40. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1795.48s)]
*  And yet we're number one when it comes to spending per pupil. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1796.58s)]
*  Does that sound good? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1799.26s)]
*  Well, there's a bill that just passed the Ways and Means [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1800.36s)]
*  Committee. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1801.6s)]
*  You know, it could pass in your first hundred days as president. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1802.7s)]
*  Sounds like you'd sign it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1807.3999999999999s)]
*  I would sign it. Anything to do with school choice. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1808.5s)]
*  But also, separate from school choice, we're going to take the [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1811.06s)]
*  Department of Education, close it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1813.74s)]
*  I'm going to close it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1815.76s)]
*  We'll have one person, could be you, if you decide to retire. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1817.4s)]
*  Okay, Mr. President, here's who bothers me about that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1820.2s)]
*  So let's say you have a liberal city. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1824.64s)]
*  Let's say it's Los Angeles, San Diego, and they just decide, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1826.0800000000002s)]
*  oh, we're going to get rid of that history. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1828.3400000000001s)]
*  We have new history. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1830.3400000000001s)]
*  This is America built off the backs of slaves on stolen land. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1831.44s)]
*  And that curriculum comes in. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1834.42s)]
*  Then we don't send them money. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1835.78s)]
*  We would save half of our budget. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1837.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1839.52s)]
*  But if they want to do that... [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1840.6200000000001s)]
*  Because you do lose control when you go low. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1841.72s)]
*  Well, we've lost control. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1843.22s)]
*  We're number 40. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1845.48s)]
*  We're last on the list. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1846.5800000000002s)]
*  We're the worst there is, and we spend more money. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1847.68s)]
*  And a lot of states... [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1850.42s)]
*  Look, you know what's going to happen. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1851.52s)]
*  The states that are well run now, like I don't want to say [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1852.8600000000001s)]
*  specifically because... [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1856.16s)]
*  But you take Indiana. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1857.66s)]
*  It's so nice. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1858.8600000000001s)]
*  No debt, no... [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1859.96s)]
*  Everything is good. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1861.0600000000002s)]
*  Our beautiful Iowa, right, that I win every time. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1862.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1865.5s)]
*  Take every one of those states. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1866.6000000000001s)]
*  So let's say out of the 50, we have close to 40 like that. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1868.2s)]
*  Then you have the laggards run by guys like Gavin Newscombe, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1871.3400000000001s)]
*  who is... [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1874.3799999999999s)]
*  You probably won't do as well there, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1875.48s)]
*  but then you have to watch it a little bit more. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1876.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1878.58s)]
*  No, if they want to get cute, then you don't send them the money. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1879.6799999999998s)]
*  So, Mr. President, we got a question [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1881.4599999999998s)]
*  from my home state of Texas. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1882.76s)]
*  This is Don. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1883.86s)]
*  He has a question about accomplishments. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1884.9599999999998s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. President. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1887.6s)]
*  My name is Don Albright. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1889.1599999999999s)]
*  I live in Katy, Texas. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1890.6599999999999s)]
*  My question is, what is something [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1892.4599999999998s)]
*  that you did not accomplish in your first term [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1894.6399999999999s)]
*  that you would like to accomplish in this term? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1897.54s)]
*  Well, you know, we had a great first term. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1900.9399999999998s)]
*  We had the greatest economy we've ever had. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1902.94s)]
*  We had the strongest borders we've ever had. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1905.48s)]
*  We rebuilt the entire U.S. military. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1907.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, they gave a lot of it to Afghanistan [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1909.98s)]
*  in one of the worst times ever. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1913.76s)]
*  I think the biggest thing for me in terms of government [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1915.8600000000001s)]
*  is great people. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1918.9s)]
*  I had great people. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1920.2s)]
*  I had a lot of great, like Bob Lighthizer and Trit. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1921.3s)]
*  We had great people. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1923.3s)]
*  But I had a couple of clinkers that I would not want again. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1924.4s)]
*  And I know... [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1928.24s)]
*  I didn't know... [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1929.3400000000001s)]
*  You have to understand, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1930.44s)]
*  I was there 17 times in my entire life. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1931.54s)]
*  All of a sudden, I'm president. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1934.14s)]
*  I'm saying whatever. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1935.54s)]
*  And people are recommending different people. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1936.64s)]
*  Of the people, usually we got it right, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1939.1200000000001s)]
*  but there were some ones that we didn't get right. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1941.8200000000002s)]
*  I now know everybody in Washington. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1944.48s)]
*  I think it's been enforced. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1946.06s)]
*  I know people in Washington that nobody ever heard of. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1948.72s)]
*  Now you'll be the most experienced president. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1950.9s)]
*  I think I'll be the most experienced guy. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1952.3s)]
*  I know the good ones, the bad ones, the dumb ones, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1953.9s)]
*  the smart ones, the loyal ones, the people that want to run. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1956.14s)]
*  What about the list of the dumb ones? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1959.7s)]
*  Let's hear that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1960.84s)]
*  Oh, I give you a list. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1961.9399999999998s)]
*  All the people that were involved. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1963.04s)]
*  Most of them are the people that I fired. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1964.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, when you fire... [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1966.74s)]
*  You know, Biden has never fired anybody. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1968.74s)]
*  He should have fired a lot of generals [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1970.54s)]
*  and a lot of people for Afghanistan as an example. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1972.98s)]
*  I took out ISIS. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1976.52s)]
*  I promote people. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1978.06s)]
*  I beat ISIS. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1979.28s)]
*  It was supposed to take five years. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1980.3799999999999s)]
*  It took one month. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1981.48s)]
*  I did it in one month. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1982.6s)]
*  We have unbelievable generals. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1983.6999999999998s)]
*  We have unbelievable military. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1986.5s)]
*  But not the guys like Billy that you see on television [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1988.26s)]
*  all the time. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1990.6599999999999s)]
*  We have great people. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1991.76s)]
*  Are those generals fired when you do it? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1992.86s)]
*  Because some of the people involved in Afghanistan... [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1994.1599999999999s)]
*  Got fired a lot of them. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1995.76s)]
*  Almost every person that speaks badly of me. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1996.86s)]
*  Look, firing, I know a lot about firing. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=1998.56s)]
*  When you fire somebody, you can do it nicely [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2000.84s)]
*  and take a year and just, you know, not working out, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2003.54s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2005.98s)]
*  I've done that. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2006.98s)]
*  And I've done it, get out, you're fired. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2008.08s)]
*  Get out. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2010.2199999999998s)]
*  And I've done it. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2011.32s)]
*  I saw that on TV. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2012.4199999999998s)]
*  But can I tell you, I did quite well. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2013.52s)]
*  So I've done it always. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2015.12s)]
*  You know at the end, when you get fired, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2017.36s)]
*  you get fired, it doesn't matter. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2019.12s)]
*  You might as well just do it quickly. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2020.24s)]
*  And then if you're famous, like me, they write a book. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2021.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2025.78s)]
*  Because the sleazebags come out and they offer them [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2026.88s)]
*  a million dollars to write a book. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2029.68s)]
*  And then sometimes they'll say, I want to make it good. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2031.06s)]
*  No, we're not interested in a good book. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2033.92s)]
*  We're only... [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2035.5s)]
*  So I end up with more books and I just end up... [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2036.6000000000001s)]
*  And I end up with... [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2038.9s)]
*  It is true. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2040.0s)]
*  If Bush fired somebody, nobody cares about Bush. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2041.1000000000001s)]
*  They couldn't care less about Bush. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2044.5s)]
*  I think you do. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2046.04s)]
*  You're like, oh, you like Bush. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2047.14s)]
*  I do. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2048.2400000000002s)]
*  Are you like W? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2049.2999999999997s)]
*  You guys get along. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2050.3999999999996s)]
*  He's fine. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2051.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, but I disagreed with what he did so much. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2052.6s)]
*  I just disagreed with... [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2054.8399999999997s)]
*  So you like kids? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2055.9399999999996s)]
*  I really disagreed with what he did. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2057.04s)]
*  Got us into the Middle East. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2058.9399999999996s)]
*  We spent $10 trillion. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2060.54s)]
*  We got nothing, so... [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2062.64s)]
*  Except death. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2064.54s)]
*  So you like kids? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2065.64s)]
*  Here's a 10-year-old from Tennessee. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2066.74s)]
*  He has a question for the 45th president. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2068.4799999999996s)]
*  I'm Trump. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2073.02s)]
*  I'm Daniel and I'm 10. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2074.12s)]
*  And I'm from Tennessee. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2075.4199999999996s)]
*  What was your favorite president [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2077.02s)]
*  when you were little? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2078.5s)]
*  Who was your favorite president when you were little? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2079.6s)]
*  So I liked Ronald Reagan. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2081.7000000000003s)]
*  I thought he was... [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2083.52s)]
*  Look, I didn't love his trade policy. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2084.62s)]
*  I'm a very good trade... [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2087.62s)]
*  I've made some great trade deals for us. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  The USM Seattle. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2090.62s)]
*  That wasn't his strength, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  but he had a great dignity about him. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2093.42s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, you could say, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2095.2200000000003s)]
*  there's our president more than any others, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2097.02s)]
*  really any of the others. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2099.66s)]
*  Great presidents. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2101.66s)]
*  Well, Lincoln was probably a great president, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2103.16s)]
*  although I've always said, why wasn't that settled? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2105.36s)]
*  You know, I'm a guy that... [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2108.08s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2109.18s)]
*  We had a civil war. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2110.28s)]
*  Half the country left before he got there. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2111.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2112.96s)]
*  But you'd almost say like, why wasn't that... [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2114.06s)]
*  As an example, Ukraine would have never happened, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2116.66s)]
*  and Russia, if I were president, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2119.06s)]
*  Israel would have never happened, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2120.7s)]
*  October 7th would have never happened. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2122.3s)]
*  As you know, Iran was broke. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2124.1s)]
*  They wanted to make a deal. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2126.2s)]
*  I told anybody who buys any oil from Iran, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2127.8s)]
*  you're finished, you know, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2130.4s)]
*  you can't deal with the United States. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2132.3s)]
*  Nobody was buying oil from Iran. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2134.2s)]
*  They came, they wanted to make a deal. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2135.94s)]
*  Now they have 300 billion in cash. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2137.58s)]
*  Biden has been, and her, she's, I don't know, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2140.08s)]
*  she was involved in it, but she's terrible. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2143.68s)]
*  Hey, look, remember this. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2146.36s)]
*  She was the border czar. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2147.66s)]
*  She never went there. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2149.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2150.16s)]
*  She was the border czar and the border patrol. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2151.2599999999998s)]
*  The one thing you have to remember, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2153.56s)]
*  the border patrol gave the strongest endorsement [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2154.96s)]
*  that anybody's ever seen. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2158.6s)]
*  He's the best there is. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2160.0s)]
*  There's never been, he's the greatest president, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2161.6s)]
*  the greatest at the border, and she's terrible. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2164.04s)]
*  That was their policy. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2166.38s)]
*  And these guys are great, by the way. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2167.78s)]
*  These are great. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2168.98s)]
*  You know them very well from the show. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2170.08s)]
*  We got the best endorsement, and that really says it all. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2171.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think the border is a bigger thing [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2175.02s)]
*  than inflation and the economy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2176.48s)]
*  You know, I watch your polling where it says [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2177.88s)]
*  the economy and inflation are number one, two, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2180.7200000000003s)]
*  and then it says, it always says, like the three. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2183.1600000000003s)]
*  I think the border is bigger. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2186.1000000000004s)]
*  I got elected in 2016 on the border. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2188.6000000000004s)]
*  I did a great job. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2190.7000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't even mention it after that [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2191.7000000000003s)]
*  because nobody cared because it was fixed. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2193.1000000000004s)]
*  We had a great border. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2195.16s)]
*  Then they blew it, and I have to do it again. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2196.16s)]
*  The difference is it's much worse this time [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2198.4s)]
*  because they're allowing millions of people [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2201.2999999999997s)]
*  into our country that shouldn't be here. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2203.9s)]
*  So Mr. President, we got a fun one. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2205.5s)]
*  But we'll fix it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2206.7799999999997s)]
*  We got a six-year-old from Massachusetts, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2207.7799999999997s)]
*  and he wants to know about your favorite animal. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2209.72s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2212.52s)]
*  Mr. President, my name is Briar. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2213.92s)]
*  I'm six years old. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2216.46s)]
*  I live on a farm in Massachusetts. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2218.38s)]
*  What's your favorite farm animal? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2221.2599999999998s)]
*  Favorite farm animal. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2223.7599999999998s)]
*  What's the animal? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2224.78s)]
*  Well, you know, I'll tell you what I love. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2225.88s)]
*  I love cows. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2229.32s)]
*  But if we go with Kamala, you won't have any cows anymore [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2230.82s)]
*  because you're not allowed. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2233.96s)]
*  I don't want to ruin this kid's day. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  I love cows. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2238.5400000000004s)]
*  I think they're so cute and so beautiful and so productive. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2239.8s)]
*  But according to Kamala, who's a radical left lunatic, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2242.94s)]
*  you will not have any cows anymore. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2246.78s)]
*  So we have to vote her out. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2248.84s)]
*  If you like cows, you have to vote her out. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2250.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2251.88s)]
*  Mr. President, I got a question for you. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2252.88s)]
*  Either today or tomorrow, you're going to McDonald's. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2254.34s)]
*  You're going to be working the fryer. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2256.94s)]
*  Are you going to wear the paper hat? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2258.3s)]
*  I'm going to do everything. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2259.7400000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2260.7400000000002s)]
*  You're going to do it. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2261.6400000000003s)]
*  A friend of mine owns McDonald's someplace. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2262.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, I'm going because she lied. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2265.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't think she ever worked at McDonald's? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2268.1800000000003s)]
*  I know she did. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2269.98s)]
*  We checked it out. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2270.78s)]
*  Unless somebody comes up with something. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2272.02s)]
*  We checked it out. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2273.42s)]
*  They said she never worked here. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2274.42s)]
*  She even picked the store. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2275.86s)]
*  We went to the manager. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2276.9s)]
*  The manager's been there forever. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2277.9s)]
*  You remember her? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2279.76s)]
*  No, she never worked here. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2280.5600000000004s)]
*  They know. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2281.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2282.6000000000004s)]
*  Will you wear the paper hat? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2283.52s)]
*  And you know who else I'm talking about? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2284.98s)]
*  The press. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2286.52s)]
*  If I said I worked at McDonald's and it turned out [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2287.56s)]
*  not to be true, this would be the front page [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2290.02s)]
*  of that stupid New York Times, the worst paper. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2293.06s)]
*  It is the worst rag. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2295.96s)]
*  The New York Times is the worst, most. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2297.9s)]
*  They would have me front page for months. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2300.4s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2303.64s)]
*  I can't get any. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2304.6s)]
*  That's why I have to do it myself. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2305.58s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2306.64s)]
*  So you're going to get trained and you're [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2307.68s)]
*  going to make French fries. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2308.58s)]
*  Well, I don't know how much the training will be. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2309.68s)]
*  Not too much salt. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2311.52s)]
*  Not going to be. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2312.3s)]
*  Oh. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2313.36s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2314.2000000000003s)]
*  I love that show. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2315.0s)]
*  I don't know how you do it. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2317.0s)]
*  You were at the barbershop yesterday in the Bronx. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2318.5s)]
*  You did the Al Smith dinner last night. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2320.34s)]
*  Probably didn't get home until 1 or 2 in the morning. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2322.0s)]
*  And you know what else I did? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you're here. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2325.48s)]
*  I got in. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2326.52s)]
*  OK, this was a crazy day. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2327.52s)]
*  We did your thing. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2329.42s)]
*  I did five other things. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2330.42s)]
*  And then on top of it, I came back [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2331.98s)]
*  and I was really, really like tight [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2333.76s)]
*  because I'm the keynote speaker at the Al Smith. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2336.6200000000003s)]
*  So what happens is I said, let's go. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2339.38s)]
*  I want to go, sir, you have an interview with Tyrus. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2342.52s)]
*  He's a large guy, by the way. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2346.52s)]
*  Is he a great guy? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2348.26s)]
*  And you're a very smart guy. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2349.32s)]
*  He is great. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2351.1000000000004s)]
*  And he's been so good to me. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2351.7000000000003s)]
*  And he said, listen, there's no election here. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2352.8s)]
*  You're going to win this thing in the last. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2354.5s)]
*  And he's been saying that for a long time. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2355.7000000000003s)]
*  Whenever they talk about it, he's funny. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2357.44s)]
*  And Gutfeld is great. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2359.54s)]
*  He didn't like me originally. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2361.6000000000004s)]
*  And then he said, well, I don't like Gutfeld, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2362.98s)]
*  but you can like him. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2365.1800000000003s)]
*  You're not like him. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2366.34s)]
*  No, he liked him. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2367.1800000000003s)]
*  But he had the highest rating in the history of the show. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2368.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2371.6s)]
*  Yeah, we're proud of him. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2372.2s)]
*  But Tyrus, he has a website. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2373.2999999999997s)]
*  And he said, would you do my show? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2375.54s)]
*  So like two, three weeks, I agreed. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2377.0s)]
*  So I came home. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2378.54s)]
*  I'm running because I'd like to at least see my speech [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2379.64s)]
*  before I get up before all these killers. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2382.04s)]
*  And I'm running in. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2384.12s)]
*  Sir Tyrus is waiting for you. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2384.98s)]
*  Oh, oh. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2386.18s)]
*  And I have to put on a tuxedo. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2388.08s)]
*  In theory, white tie. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2389.52s)]
*  But a lot of people didn't have white tie, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2390.66s)]
*  but they had tuxedo. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2392.22s)]
*  And I'm running in. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2393.46s)]
*  And you know what I did? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2394.86s)]
*  Rather than saying, Tyrus, I can't make it, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2395.9s)]
*  I said, let's go, Tyrus. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2397.98s)]
*  Let's do a quick one. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2399.28s)]
*  So I knocked it out. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2400.58s)]
*  That was it. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2401.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2402.6800000000003s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2403.52s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2404.52s)]
*  Mr. Perth, you're going to be back on the camp. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2405.7200000000003s)]
*  Actually, you got another event to go to. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2407.02s)]
*  Thank you for giving us some time. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2408.36s)]
*  You know what the event I have now? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2409.76s)]
*  No. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2411.26s)]
*  A very big event. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2412.06s)]
*  I'm going to see Rupert Murdoch. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2413.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2414.7000000000003s)]
*  That's a big event. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2415.5s)]
*  I don't know if he's thrilled that I said it. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2416.5s)]
*  Please tell him we also thank you. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2418.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to tell him something very simple, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2419.84s)]
*  because I can't talk to anybody else about it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2421.6s)]
*  Don't put on negative commercials for 21 days. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  Don't put them. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2426.2400000000002s)]
*  And don't put on their horrible people that come in line. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2427.18s)]
*  I'm going to say, Rupert, please do it this way. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2431.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2433.2799999999997s)]
*  And then we're going to have a victory, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2434.3799999999997s)]
*  because I think everyone wants to have a victory. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2435.46s)]
*  And you're going to out-kick. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2436.56s)]
*  It's a great channel that we have with Tyrus. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2437.56s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2440.12s)]
*  There you go. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKzo0hTJXB4&t=2440.92s)]
