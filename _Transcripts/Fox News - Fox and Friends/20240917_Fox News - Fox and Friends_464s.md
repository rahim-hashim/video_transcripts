# Suspect stalked Trump golf course, hid for 12 hours
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk)
*  Foreign President Trump is speaking publicly for the first time since being targeted by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=0.0s)]
*  a would-be assassin for the second time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=4.04s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington with the latest for us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=6.4s)]
*  Hey, Maddie. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=8.96s)]
*  Hi, guys. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=9.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=10.96s)]
*  More charges could be coming for suspect Ryan Wesley Ruth. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=11.96s)]
*  He's already facing two federal gun charges, which we're told were the fastest to write [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=13.68s)]
*  up and keep him in custody. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Phone records show he may have waited for roughly 12 hours near Trump International [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=20.6s)]
*  Golf Course. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=24.32s)]
*  Here's body cam footage showing him being arrested. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=25.52s)]
*  While the Secret Service says Ruth never got a line of sight to Trump, the tree line at [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=28.32s)]
*  the club had been a point of concern for some time because of how easily photographers could [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=32.16s)]
*  take snapshots of the former president. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=36.9s)]
*  Overnight, Trump on ex-basis addressed the apparent second assassination attempt against [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=39.92s)]
*  him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=44.16s)]
*  All of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  And it sounded like bullets, but what do I know about that? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=53.32s)]
*  The Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  And they grabbed me, and I would have loved to have sank that last putt. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  But we decided, let's get out of here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=63.76s)]
*  Ruth was spotted laughing several times during his court appearance on Monday. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=67.0s)]
*  Former neighbors have described Ruth as unusual, but didn't expect him to do what he's accused [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=70.92s)]
*  of doing over the weekend. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=75.56s)]
*  They had a horse in the house, I mean, an old-life horse in the house. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  But I said the guns and stuff and all, I mean, but yeah, they were, I mean, kind of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=81.04s)]
*  weird, you know, but, you know, they didn't bother me, I didn't bother them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=86.92s)]
*  Sunday's incident putting campaign rhetoric back in the spotlight with Republicans and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=91.4s)]
*  Democrats accusing each other of using harsh language and raising the temperature. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump says Ruth acted on the rhetoric of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=100.76s)]
*  We're still waiting to hear of a motive from police. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Lauren, Steve Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=107.64000000000001s)]
*  Lauren Madeline, thank you very much. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=109.84s)]
*  In the last hour, we had a former Secret Service special agent who was in charge of Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=111.8s)]
*  detail for a while and in fact covered him at that particular golf course. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=117.6s)]
*  He was reacting to Mr. Roe, the Secret Service acting director, yesterday saying that, you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=122.98s)]
*  know, that particular event on Sunday was off the record. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=128.6s)]
*  But the guy we talked to said the president, former president, and when he was president, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=132.72s)]
*  would oftentimes go to the golf course, even though they didn't have it on the schedule. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=137.68s)]
*  They would have a package ready to go. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  And so even though it wasn't on the schedule on Sunday, they had taken preliminary precautions [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=145.16s)]
*  on, OK, if he goes golfing this day, we're going to do this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=151.0s)]
*  You can figure Sunday, nice day, he's off. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=153.96s)]
*  He's golfing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=156.68s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=157.68s)]
*  I think Sunday on a nice day, assumptions would be he's golfing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=158.68s)]
*  Every Sunday. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=162.08s)]
*  Well, we knew that Sean said he was invited to go golfing with him on Sunday morning and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=163.08s)]
*  so did the guy who ended up going golfing with him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=166.44s)]
*  He was there and they knew about it Sunday morning. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=169.32s)]
*  So I'm not sure why Secret Service, you know, wasn't out there hours before. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=171.28s)]
*  And I also find it curious that they're talking about the release of not releasing schedules. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=174.68s)]
*  I mean, this wasn't on the calendar as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=180.12s)]
*  How did this guy know? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=183.04s)]
*  You guys didn't properly secure this as well. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=184.04s)]
*  How did this guy know he was going to be playing golf? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=187.28s)]
*  But I think to Brian's point, it's like if it's a nice day in Florida, he's probably [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=190.64s)]
*  going golfing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=193.72s)]
*  That's what so many of the people we've talked to said, you know, it's kind of a no-brainer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=195.0s)]
*  But going forward, there are certain big things that are on the president and vice president's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=200.11999999999998s)]
*  calendar that people know of, but there are other things that they are not making public [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=204.88s)]
*  because they don't want to help anybody, you know, do that again. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=209.2s)]
*  Reporters went in there to talk to neighbors in North Carolina, in Greensboro, where this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=214.04s)]
*  alleged shooter used to live. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=218.76s)]
*  He moved to Hawaii in May with his girlfriend, according to neighbors. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  One neighbor said he had a horse and a bunch of guns in his house. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=223.92s)]
*  Another neighbor described him as unusual, said a lot of people were afraid of him back [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=227.28s)]
*  in the day. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  But when he moved to Hawaii, he gave her a Hawaiian shirt. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  He hugged her and he hired her son to go move him out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, put it this way, I'm surprised he was doing everything except wearing a shirt that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=237.44s)]
*  said Future Assassin. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, if you think about it, he was too crazy to fight in Ukraine. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  They sent him back. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=245.2s)]
*  They go, this guy's nuts. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=246.2s)]
*  I want to go back. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=247.2s)]
*  And then when he was traveling back, this woman was with him, went and met with Homeland [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=248.2s)]
*  Security and said this guy's extremely dangerous. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=252.24s)]
*  She just left the war zone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  She's a nurse. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=255.84s)]
*  She goes, he's as dangerous as anyone I've ever been with. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  In a book, in the book, he urges Iran to assassinate Donald Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=259.08s)]
*  He voted for him 2016, says a horrible, horrible person in every expletive possible, urging [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=263.12s)]
*  direct reply to Joe Biden, try to get his attention and give Joe Biden some advice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  He sat out there from one fifty in the morning until the time in which his barrel was spotted [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=274.6s)]
*  leaking out of the fence on the fence line. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=281.2s)]
*  They did say Secret Service. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=283.76s)]
*  We did not have anybody on the perimeter. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  They didn't even say they were patrolling on the perimeter. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=287.64s)]
*  And I remember I got with George Bush twice and both times you get to the on the edge [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=289.88s)]
*  like three or four holes. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=294.48s)]
*  You're next to families like both those golf courses next to families. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=296.0s)]
*  And I thought to myself, I know he's the former president, but have these families been talked [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=299.64s)]
*  to because they might have a problem with them? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  This might be a place to take a shot at him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  We know that Bin Laden was trying to still trying to kill him at the time and all the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=307.84s)]
*  Al Qaeda guys. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=312.0s)]
*  So I guess that struck me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=313.32s)]
*  I don't know if it's possible. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=314.84s)]
*  And it's also Donald Trump is not your typical former president because of two things. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=317.08s)]
*  One, he could be the next president again. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=322.4s)]
*  So you would think, OK, maybe we give him you can't have a cookie cutter system because [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  there are sometimes things are going to fall within the normal scope. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=331.88s)]
*  So he could be the next. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=335.32s)]
*  Number two is there are active threats when it comes to Iran, not just him, but other [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=336.36s)]
*  former cabinet members. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=341.32s)]
*  But the Iranians are pros, sadly. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=342.32s)]
*  Mike Pompeo still has a detail. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=344.2s)]
*  Remember the Pakistani that pled not guilty yesterday? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=345.84s)]
*  He came over and the FBI realized who he was. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=348.88s)]
*  They set him up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=351.76s)]
*  They got him to try to solicit a would-be gunman. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=352.76s)]
*  It was an FBI double agent who said, OK, you're coming with me. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=354.8s)]
*  You're under arrest. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=357.88s)]
*  He pled not guilty, but he's from Pakistan, lived in Iran, is now in New York trying to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=358.88s)]
*  get assassins to kill Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=364.76s)]
*  Brian, what the Secret Service is saying right now, according to the press conference [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=366.32s)]
*  yesterday, after the last incident before this one, they upgraded his security to be [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=369.64s)]
*  presidential level. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=375.92s)]
*  Are you telling me what took place? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=378.52s)]
*  That is presidential level protection to have someone within the scope for 300 yards? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShC79oUbFFk&t=381.28s)]
