# Sheriff featured in Kamala Harris ad voices outrage: 'I do not support her'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0)
*  Kamala Harris has spent decades fighting violent crime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=0.0s)]
*  As a border state prosecutor, she took on drug cartels [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=3.1s)]
*  and jailed gang members for smuggling weapons and drugs across the border. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  So Kamala Harris trying to flip the script on her border record. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  And one sheriff that is in that ad is outraged, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=15.42s)]
*  as she uses his image to do so. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=18.06s)]
*  To Larry County, California Sheriff Mike Boudreau joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=20.88s)]
*  So, Sheriff, when you saw that ad, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=24.42s)]
*  and that she was representing you as an endorsement, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=26.6s)]
*  what was your reaction? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=29.58s)]
*  Well, I can tell you here in California, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=31.7s)]
*  we're ready for someone that's going to support law enforcement. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=33.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris in law enforcement in California, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=36.66s)]
*  we're very familiar with her, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=38.7s)]
*  and how she has done over the course of years as a senator, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=40.46s)]
*  and as a prosecutor, and as the attorney general. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=43.58s)]
*  And I can tell you that this ad is deceiving, to say the least. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  I remember this particular case where we did a drug cartel, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=51.34s)]
*  or a drug trafficking organization, where we worked with DEA. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  And the issue was that in this particular situation, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=59.42s)]
*  she showed up for a sound bite. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=62.52s)]
*  She didn't shake anyone's hands, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=65.42s)]
*  and she quickly left the briefing room. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  So for me in law enforcement, to see my face and image, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=71.66s)]
*  along with my law enforcement counterparts, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=75.16s)]
*  being represented as standing alongside Kamala Harris, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=77.18s)]
*  was truly disheartening. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=80.7s)]
*  We do not support Kamala Harris. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  She has a history of not supporting law enforcement. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=83.94s)]
*  And I just wanted to come out and say that for me, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  in Tulare County, the sheriff of Tulare County, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=88.64s)]
*  looking out for victims, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=90.84s)]
*  looking for someone who's going to support criminal justice [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=92.44s)]
*  and law enforcement, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=94.98s)]
*  that is best represented by Donald Trump, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  and not Kamala Harris. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=98.36s)]
*  You know, it's remarkable, sheriff, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=99.26s)]
*  because I've never heard of a politician go in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  amongst a group of voters or other elected officials, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=103.36s)]
*  law enforcement, and not shake their hands. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  But part of the spin, people in the media, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=109.14s)]
*  or people that support Kamala Harris, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=111.76s)]
*  they're saying that she's changed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=113.66s)]
*  Do you believe Kamala Harris has changed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=115.7s)]
*  on the issue of the border and the cartel? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=117.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, I have to go along with what history shows. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=121.34s)]
*  And history, with her record, does not show [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=123.8s)]
*  that she's supportive of any type of law enforcement agency. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=125.84s)]
*  She's not supportive of a secure and strong border. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=130.02s)]
*  It's evident. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=134.28s)]
*  When we have untold amounts of fentanyl, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  cartels right here in my county [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=138.38s)]
*  that we have worked to dismantle, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=140.0s)]
*  along with human trafficking that takes place [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=142.4s)]
*  up and down the state of California, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=144.62s)]
*  right across the border. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  When she was the attorney general, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=147.52s)]
*  that could have been secured. It wasn't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  Her as vice president could have made move to secure that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=153.56s)]
*  So I would say that we have to go on a track record. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=154.6s)]
*  The track record is not conducive or supportive [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=156.66s)]
*  of anything that she's saying within that ad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=159.44s)]
*  Real quickly, sheriff, one of the criticisms that I've heard, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=161.16s)]
*  even former staffers that have gone, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=163.9s)]
*  they won't provide their name, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=166.74s)]
*  but they say when they're doing briefings with her [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=167.84s)]
*  that she's not aware of the topics, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=170.44s)]
*  she's not... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=171.94s)]
*  She doesn't read the briefing books, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=173.62s)]
*  but just with your experience with Kamala Harris [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=176.1s)]
*  when she was AG, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=178.9s)]
*  does she seem to understand what was happening at the time? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=180.34s)]
*  Well, in the particular case that we were there [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=185.92s)]
*  in that video clip, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=188.76s)]
*  she did not fully have all the information. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=190.18s)]
*  But having said that, the attorney general here in California [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=193.02s)]
*  goes through thousands of cases. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=195.8s)]
*  I mean, I can't criticize her for not being directly briefed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=198.12s)]
*  on many cases, but in that particular case, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=201.26s)]
*  it was as if she had received a last-minute briefing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=204.12s)]
*  Yeah. Sheriff, someone that knows Kamala Harris [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  that is in the state that she once represented, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=211.32s)]
*  Sheriff Boudreau, thank you so much for joining the program. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=214.04s)]
*  No, I appreciate it. Thank you. Have a great day. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  I wonder if they're going to take that ad down [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=219.78s)]
*  now that the sheriff is saying he does not support her. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=221.7s)]
*  All right, we'll be following. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdpOVB466K0&t=225.01999999999998s)]
