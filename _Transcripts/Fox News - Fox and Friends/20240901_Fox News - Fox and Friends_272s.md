# Kamala Harris is being hidden from the voters: Rep. Byron Donalds
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. A vigil will be held tonight here in New York City for the six [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=0.0s)]
*  hostages found dead in Gaza just days ago. An IDF spokesman says the body of American [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=4.4s)]
*  Hirsch Goldberg, Poland and five others were quote brutally murdered, possibly a day or two [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=10.08s)]
*  before troops discovered them. Hamas adopted all six on October 7th. Our next guest has been sounding [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=16.88s)]
*  the alarm on the importance of supporting Israel. GOP Congressman Byron Donalds joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=23.92s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for joining us this morning. This is tragic news. All these lives are of equal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=29.36s)]
*  importance, but one of them wasn't American. Now we have four Americans that have been found [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=35.12s)]
*  dead and four still captive. What pressure does this put on the Biden-Harris administration to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=39.84s)]
*  get our citizens home? First, it's good to be with you. I would say these tragic events [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=45.2s)]
*  that have now happened in Gaza, the Biden-Harris administration needs to allow Israel to do the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=54.0s)]
*  job of finishing Hamas. This has been the situation really since October 7th. Israel has been prepared [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=61.04s)]
*  to do everything it can to get the hostages back, but it's been slow walked in part because of this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=67.44s)]
*  response from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They have been pressuring Israel, not allowing Israel [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  to do what is necessary. And it is unfortunate that when you have a terrorist group like Hamas [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=78.88s)]
*  that hides behind women and children, they hide behind civilians. They do this all the time, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=85.44s)]
*  but all the dithering from this administration, from Kamala Harris, from Joe Biden, that's the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=90.0s)]
*  weakness that leads to the death of hostages. There needs to be an immediate change in strategy [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=95.52s)]
*  from this White House. Yeah, we need more than anything. I want to see our government try to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=100.88s)]
*  get our people home, and I don't think that's too much to ask in any scenario. But this crisis in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=104.48s)]
*  Israel happens in the backdrop of what's happening in our country right now, which is we have an [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=109.36s)]
*  election, we have two people running for president, and there couldn't be a more stark contrast [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=113.68s)]
*  between the two. You're also hitting the road to campaign for former President Trump. I also want [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=118.08s)]
*  to bring in Black Conservative Federation founder Deontay Johnson. He's got more about this bus [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=123.2s)]
*  tour that they are launching. Deontay, tell us about it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=128.88000000000002s)]
*  So we're meeting voters exactly where they are, going to the communities, reaching out to Black [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  men. Black men are a very important target this election cycle. So we're going to them, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  we're going to barbershops, we're going to the communities. We're having conversations on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=143.44s)]
*  economics. We're having conversations comparing 2019 Donald Trump and 2019 Kamala Harris. When you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=147.36s)]
*  put both together, it's not a good thing for Kamala. Congressman Donalds, you're in Florida, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=154.96s)]
*  and that's a place that shows there is no monolithic group of people that vote one way or the other. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=161.36s)]
*  You've got elderly people in Florida, you've got South Florida, which is largely Hispanic, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=165.44s)]
*  you've got every race and ethnicity there. People move there from all over the country, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=169.52s)]
*  but there's been a red wave in Florida. The politics in Florida have moved to the right as [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=172.96s)]
*  people have moved to Florida. What can this bus tour do and this coalition do to show that there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=178.16s)]
*  isn't some monolithic ideology among Black Americans or urban Americans or any group of Americans? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=185.2s)]
*  Well, what it does is going to bring key information to voters who frankly are craving it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=193.28s)]
*  Everybody knows what Donald Trump wants to do. People remember the Donald Trump economy, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=197.68s)]
*  but they're hiding Kamala Harris from the voters. Obviously, the interview last the other day [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  did not go well for her and for her team, so they hide her. So we got to take this information [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=207.28s)]
*  straight to people. How was the economy when Donald Trump was president? Significantly better [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=212.0s)]
*  economy. Were our cities secure? Was our country secure at the southern border? Absolutely. And [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=216.56s)]
*  then like we talked at the top of this interview, what was happening around the globe? Were there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=222.16s)]
*  conflicts all over the place when Donald Trump was president? No, there was not. There was peace [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=226.32s)]
*  through strength around the world. That message has to go through everywhere. The BCF bus tour [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=230.8s)]
*  is going to help accommodate that mission. Deontay, Congressman Donalds, thank you both. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=235.44s)]
*  It's amazing to believe that issues that are affecting Americans could be important to all [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=239.52s)]
*  Americans and I think you all are spreading that message and we truly appreciate you for it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=245.28s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Yes, sir. All right. We did reach out to the Harris-Waltz campaign [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=251.28s)]
*  and invited them on, but we haven't heard back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjW2NUqkXs4&t=258.24s)]
