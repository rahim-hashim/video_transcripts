# Pope Leo XIV's brother pulls the curtain back on childhood with first American pontiff
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs)
*  History made as Chicago native Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected to the papacy on Thursday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=0.0s)]
*  And as the world seeks to learn more about our new pope, there are a few people who can offer more insight than his family. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Pope Leo XIV's brother, Louis Prevost, joins us now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for being with us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  I just got to start by asking, you know, like the rest of the world, you were watching this this past week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=21.32s)]
*  Was there ever a world in which you thought, man, my brother, my little brother could end up becoming Pope? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=28.96s)]
*  How did that strike you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=36.56s)]
*  As you can imagine, it was a blow, a shock. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=39.72s)]
*  As I said, I don't know to a lot of people that that day that happened, I was not feeling real well. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=45.36s)]
*  I was I took the day off work to stay in bed and try to recover. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=51.6s)]
*  And my wife had gone to work, she called. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  We were watching, you know, we knew he had a chance. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=58.92s)]
*  He was made Cardinal. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=62.64s)]
*  He said, hey, you could be the next pope. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=63.68s)]
*  And we all laughed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  I had. Yeah, probably not. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Just because everything you've always heard is from the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=69.68s)]
*  He's young. He's from South America again, where you just have hope from South America. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=73.64s)]
*  So chances are probably not. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=80.16s)]
*  But still in the back of your mind, you knew he had a chance. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=83.24s)]
*  And so when she called and said there's white smoke, there's white smoke. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=87.64s)]
*  I was up, got up, turned the TV on, was watching your guy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=91.8s)]
*  Well, who was I think outnumbered was out at the time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=96.52s)]
*  And they were live from the Vatican and I'm watching the chimney with the white smoke. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=100.56s)]
*  OK, OK, I see a smoke coming. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=105.88s)]
*  Who was locked in? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=107.88s)]
*  And from the point that the white smoke came out till that little clip there when the first [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=110.12s)]
*  Cardinal came out to announce we have a new pope. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  And then it's like, OK, OK, that scene between when they said they had it and they said his name [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=120.0s)]
*  seemed like an eternity to me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=126.8s)]
*  Why don't you just go out and tell us? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=128.84s)]
*  And then when he started to say Nombre Roberto, as soon as he started with the Roberto, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=130.92s)]
*  I knew and I was like, thank God I was sitting in bed still because I might have fallen over. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=137.6s)]
*  That's my little brother who was just me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=146.32s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=148.24s)]
*  And the last couple of days, I still hasn't fully sunk in. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=149.6s)]
*  It's still. I can't express the feelings from what this what this is like. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  It's been really fun listening to the stories of you and your other brother saying how he was [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  such a good little boy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=168.88s)]
*  And a lot of people would say, you know, you might be a pope one day, have a daughter who is very, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=169.88s)]
*  very good. We always say she's a saint. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=174.0s)]
*  Tomorrow's Mother's Day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  And I know your mom has passed on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  I can't help thinking of all the work she put in to you and your brothers and that she ended up [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  with the pope. What a what a moment is that for you on the eve of Mother's Day? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=185.04s)]
*  Oh, it's amazing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=190.6s)]
*  It almost really, you know, my parents have been gone for quite a few years now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=191.84s)]
*  But every time, you know, you think about what's happened with Rob becoming pope and how devoted [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=197.48s)]
*  our parents were to the Catholic Church, even, and the work they did for the church and how they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=205.04s)]
*  supported Rob the whole time when he was playing his priestly games a little kid. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=212.16s)]
*  Well, unlike me, who used to make fun of him, they kind of support him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  Is that what you really want to do? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=224.0s)]
*  And if so, let's go. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  And so you've you've obviously talked to him a couple of times since then. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  Or do you still call him Rob? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=233.2s)]
*  I haven't talked to him yet, believe it or not. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=236.88s)]
*  OK, so will you? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  We tried to get a hold of him. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=240.6s)]
*  Couldn't do it. But yes, I will. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  You start calling him His Holiness. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  To me, he's he's Rob. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=247.2s)]
*  He's always going to be my little brother. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=249.6s)]
*  And I love how everybody talks about how they just knew he was going to be pope one day. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=251.64s)]
*  But he had to have been he had to have done something wrong at some point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=255.64s)]
*  He had to have been a bad kid at some point. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=260.0s)]
*  Or was he really that good? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=262.56s)]
*  I'm going to refuse to answer that question. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=266.84s)]
*  So I don't get him in trouble. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=269.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=271.44s)]
*  Smart. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=273.44s)]
*  Smart. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=275.2s)]
*  But overall, no, he was an angel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=275.8s)]
*  Yeah, he was really touching. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=278.12s)]
*  It's truly a tribute to all of you, to your entire family. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=279.96s)]
*  And a truly remarkable blessing for all of America. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsfAXu16XJs&t=284.12s)]
