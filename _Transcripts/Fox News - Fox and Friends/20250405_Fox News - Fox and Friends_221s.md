# AOC vs. Schumer? New poll stuns Democrats
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE)
*  So there's a new survey out on the the greatest political battle royale that we're all waiting for and that's the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=0.0s)]
*  matchup between [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=8.58s)]
*  AOC and Chuck Schumer if AOC decides to take on in a primary [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=10.8s)]
*  The sitting minority leader in the United States Senate Chuck Schumer [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=17.18s)]
*  It is going to be maybe the final undoing of the Democrat Party [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=20.64s)]
*  In politico the survey by liberal firm data progress which first shared with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=26.18s)]
*  With [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=34.78s)]
*  Sharing with politico their results [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=38.78s)]
*  55% of Democrats like of likely voters said they supported and leaned towards supporting AOC [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=42.14s)]
*  While 36% backed or leaned towards senator Chuck Schumer 9% were undecided anyway, so that is a gulf of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=47.46s)]
*  Whatever that is almost 20 points. Yeah that AOC would trounce Chuck Schumer in a New York primary [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  So this is one of the dangers of staying too long of not exiting. Yeah, you know stage, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  while you're still on top and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=70.62s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, you know has been there a long time and I've always said do not under-escalate people write me by the way [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=72.66s)]
*  They think that I'm so like I support AOC [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=78.82s)]
*  I don't like AOC, but I can recognize raw talent. Yep raw political talent when I see it [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=81.38000000000001s)]
*  AOC is a is a person who understands her base who understands the leftist populist streak that runs through that party [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=88.58s)]
*  She understands social media. She has a massive following [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=97.04s)]
*  She speaks she she took a page off of Donald Trump by the way speaking directly to the people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  Not having to go through the media all the time [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  Although the media is very friendly to her and she should not be underestimated [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=109.2s)]
*  If this matchup happened that I believe that poll is right [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=112.92s)]
*  I believe she would win and that that shows a major generational shift in battle that's happening right now in the Democrat [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=116.12s)]
*  I think the poll numbers are even [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=123.84s)]
*  Lower than it actually is data for progress is a liberal firm [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=126.64s)]
*  They say 55% but you talk about recognizing raw political talent [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=130.52s)]
*  You can also recognize a major political move when it happens and when Chuck Schumer voted to keep the government open [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=135.14s)]
*  I think that's when AOC saw the moment to strike and that's why you saw her on the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=142.1s)]
*  country doing her town hall stuff with Bernie Sanders trying to really fire that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=149.42s)]
*  Handing over the torch to her. Yeah for that wing of the party [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=156.54s)]
*  And never forget that AOC launched her career by taking out the number three the third most powerful [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Democrat in the house and nobody saw her come in nobody thought it would happen and she embraced being a socialist [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=167.6s)]
*  You know out in crowd. I mean she was the first one to take the mask off and say this is who I am [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=174.44s)]
*  I'm a socialist and you know other than Bernie Sanders [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=179.2s)]
*  Nobody else told you do that after that you saw a ton more the squad and now others embracing that that and so I think [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=182.32s)]
*  In some ways, I it's great. Yeah, let's we'll have a debate and a fair debate where they're not pretending to be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=188.76s)]
*  constitutionalist there this the Socialist versus [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=195.44s)]
*  the Common Sense [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  Maga Trump party that's that's a that's a battle. I'll talk about it's definitely the most fascinating storyline to watch right now in the Democratic Party [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFfXt2ieXE&t=201.0s)]
