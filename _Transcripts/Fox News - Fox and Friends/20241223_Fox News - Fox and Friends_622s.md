# Migrant allegedly lit woman on fire in NYC subway
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI)
*  Cause made the cut. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox and Friends starts now. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=1.24s)]
*  And we begin with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=6.2s)]
*  A man is arrested after allegedly setting fire [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=7.96s)]
*  to a sleeping subway passenger in New York City, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=10.76s)]
*  killing the innocent women. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=13.76s)]
*  And sources tell us the suspect is in the country illegally. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=15.4s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us now with the details [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=19.64s)]
*  on this horrible story. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=21.76s)]
*  Maddie? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the details are certainly disturbing, guys. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=23.92s)]
*  We do want to warn viewers, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=25.76s)]
*  the video you're about to watch is graphic. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=27.04s)]
*  This happened Sunday morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=29.64s)]
*  The NYPD says a person of interest, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=30.8s)]
*  whom they now have in custody, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=33.12s)]
*  and the victim are both riding the F Subway train [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=35.08s)]
*  bound for Stillway Avenue in Brooklyn. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=37.72s)]
*  As the train pulled into the station, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  the suspect walked up to the victim and lit her on fire. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=41.96s)]
*  Flames quickly overcame the woman, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=45.28s)]
*  and in one of the most chilling perhaps of this incident, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=46.92s)]
*  police say the suspect did not leave. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Instead, he sat on a bench on the platform [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  just outside the train car. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  Video appears to show the suspect watching the victim burn. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=55.6s)]
*  Because he did not leave, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=59.12s)]
*  the police officers, through their body cameras, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=60.4s)]
*  were able to get images of the suspect. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=62.6s)]
*  They distributed those, and the NYPD says [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=64.72s)]
*  three high schoolers recognized the suspect. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Sources tell Fox News Digital the suspect is [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  33-year-old Sebastian Zapata. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  While police did not identify the person of interest, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  a high-level NYPD source told Fox News Digital [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  the individual entered the US illegally from Guatemala [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=81.08s)]
*  in 2018 when President-elect Trump was president [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=84.4s)]
*  during his first term. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=86.92s)]
*  The person of interest has no prior arrests in New York City [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  and one prior arrest in Arizona, the source said, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=91.44s)]
*  though details about the arrests were not available. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=94.04s)]
*  At this hour, I am pleased to announce [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=98.92s)]
*  that a short time ago, alert NYPD Transit officers [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=101.2s)]
*  took a person of interest into custody. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=105.44s)]
*  I want you to know that this apprehension was another [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=108.72s)]
*  in what has become a series of joint efforts [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  involving different crimes between the police [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=115.16s)]
*  and the public we serve. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=118.12s)]
*  So now this is the post that New York Governor [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  Kathy Hochul is being criticized for, she said on X. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  In March, I took action to make our subway safer [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=126.28s)]
*  for the millions of people who take the trains each day. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  Since deploying the National Guard of New York [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  to support the NYPD and the MTA's safety efforts [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=134.68s)]
*  and adding cameras to all subway cars, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=138.0s)]
*  crime is going down and ridership is going up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=140.32s)]
*  New York Democratic Congressman Richie Torres [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  called her post tone deaf. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Guy, Carly, and Brian. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=148.96s)]
*  All right, Maddie, thanks so much. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=150.28s)]
*  Tone deaf, yeah, to say the least. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=152.0s)]
*  I mean, you're sitting there touting the safety [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  of the subways and this is hours after someone was lit up [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=155.72s)]
*  on live because she nodded off on a subway train. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=160.44s)]
*  Can you imagine, is there a more horrific way to die? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  It's almost too horrible to fathom or even discuss [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=166.8s)]
*  and unfortunately we're put in this position [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=171.08s)]
*  because of allegedly what that man [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=172.8s)]
*  that you see on your screen did [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=175.0s)]
*  and to make matters worse, this surveillance video [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=176.08s)]
*  appears to show that the suspect sat on a bench [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  and watched this woman burn to death [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=184.08s)]
*  as police were already starting to respond to the scene. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=186.84s)]
*  He stayed at the scene of the crime [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=190.24s)]
*  and going back to Kathy Hochul's tweet [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=192.84s)]
*  and her touting that the subway system has become safer [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  under her leadership, it wasn't only this that happened. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday on a Queen subway, two people were stabbed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=201.12s)]
*  and a 37 year old died. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=204.72s)]
*  Yeah, so two killings in the subways [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=206.48s)]
*  and you can say this is bad timing for Governor Hochul [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=209.56s)]
*  to have put out this self-congratulatory tweet [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=212.76s)]
*  on subway safety. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=215.96s)]
*  Yes, it's bad timing, it's also bad policy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=217.44s)]
*  That's why we're getting this problem [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=220.6s)]
*  and it's been an issue now for years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=222.72s)]
*  I think Hochul very belatedly is catching up [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=224.28s)]
*  to the political reality but the mess has already been made [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=227.32s)]
*  and it's gonna take a long time [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=230.44s)]
*  and quite possibly completely new leadership [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=232.04s)]
*  to change anything because the current constellation [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=235.32s)]
*  of New York leadership has been a disgrace on this issue. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=237.88s)]
*  We're just learning a few things about this suspect [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=240.8s)]
*  including that he's in the country illegally, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=243.0s)]
*  allegedly from Guatemala [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=244.72s)]
*  with a criminal record in another state. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=246.12s)]
*  It would make sense for someone like that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=248.44s)]
*  to come to New York, a sanctuary jurisdiction [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=250.2s)]
*  where he could just hang out [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=253.92s)]
*  until he decides to burn someone to death. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=254.92s)]
*  So guy, my sense is they're gonna find out [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=257.32s)]
*  this guy's got much more of a criminal history. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=260.04s)]
*  I don't think you indiscriminately burn somebody alive [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=262.16s)]
*  and think to yourself, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=264.64000000000004s)]
*  I've never done anything like this before. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  You don't jump to that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's my sense. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=268.24s)]
*  But the other thing to keep in mind too [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=269.64000000000004s)]
*  is that the cover of the New York Post, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=271.44s)]
*  I'm watching local coverage, just to see how local coverage, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  they never bring up his legal status. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  They say a man, a New York. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  Of course, it's a main part of the story. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  We know people commit crimes [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=281.72s)]
*  but when illegal immigrants come here, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  many as criminals, to commit more crimes, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  you say to yourself, if the government does its job, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=287.44000000000005s)]
*  we would not be in this type of danger. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=289.84s)]
*  And I also think that this all plays into the bigger picture [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=292.2s)]
*  of why you need massive deportation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=296.2s)]
*  and begins with criminals. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's right. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  And Eric Adams, and he recognizes that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=301.32s)]
*  and that's why he sat down and spoke to Tom Holman [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=305.08s)]
*  and says, you gotta get the criminal migrants [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=307.55999999999995s)]
*  out of the city, but his hands are tied [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=309.4s)]
*  because not only is New York City a sanctuary city, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=310.96s)]
*  it's also in a sanctuary state [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=313.2s)]
*  which goes to the point of Kathy Hochul [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  and policy change that she needs to take leadership under. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=317.7s)]
*  I mentioned Tom Holman because yesterday he was in Arizona [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=320.5s)]
*  and he introduced Donald Trump [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=323.14s)]
*  who was speaking at America Fest [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=325.3s)]
*  and Donald Trump laid out his day one priorities [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=327.1s)]
*  and you better believe border, the border control [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=329.78s)]
*  and getting criminal illegal immigrants [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=332.7s)]
*  out of this country is among them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=334.46s)]
*  When my first day back in the Oval Office, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=338.42s)]
*  I will sign a historic slate of executive orders [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=340.82s)]
*  to close our border to illegal aliens [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=343.5s)]
*  and stop the invasion of our country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=347.34s)]
*  And on that same day, we will begin the largest [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=353.7s)]
*  deportation operation in American history, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=357.18s)]
*  larger even than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=360.42s)]
*  The DEA, the FBI, the intelligence community [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=366.1s)]
*  and financial sanctions to remove the migrant gangs [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=369.26s)]
*  and criminals that are killing and raping [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=372.46s)]
*  and maiming our citizens. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  We're gonna get them out. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna get them out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=378.46s)]
*  We're gonna get them out fast. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  We have no choice. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=380.41999999999996s)]
*  So he's gonna get them out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=382.58s)]
*  That isn't a big surprise. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=384.06s)]
*  The way we're doing it, knowing that it's just weeks away, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=385.82s)]
*  people should be ready for it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=388.46s)]
*  And I thought one thing the president did yesterday, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=389.97999999999996s)]
*  he did a lot, I thought the speech was fantastic. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=392.17999999999995s)]
*  Number one, he's got his real sense of history. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=395.46s)]
*  He's always bringing up Eisenhower. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=397.17999999999995s)]
*  He was bringing up McKinley yesterday [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=398.34s)]
*  and he's bringing up, because Eisenhower did it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  and he also knows that Eisenhower's considered [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=401.5s)]
*  relatively a top president, respected. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=403.66s)]
*  And he's like, what I'm trying to do is nothing [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=407.26s)]
*  that other past presidents haven't done. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=409.98s)]
*  And by the way, Charlie Kirk, a fantastic job [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=412.22s)]
*  for what he did on the ground with Turning Point [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=414.38s)]
*  because he was the ground game in many situations. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=417.26s)]
*  And then yesterday with FEMINADE, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=419.82s)]
*  20,000 to show up to see him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=421.22s)]
*  So president, just on the illegal immigration, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=423.62s)]
*  he knows he's going criminal first [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=426.3s)]
*  and then he's gonna let people overstay their visas [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=427.78s)]
*  and then he's gonna get to see the next wave. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=429.86s)]
*  It'll take about a year and a half [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=431.98s)]
*  just to get the criminals out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=433.42s)]
*  There are so many people in this country illegally [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=434.86s)]
*  who have subsequently not just been accused [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=437.54s)]
*  of additional crimes, convicted of additional crimes. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  That is the easiest low-hanging fruit to start with. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=442.98s)]
*  And there's also over a million people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=445.86s)]
*  in this country illegally with active deportation orders [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=447.98s)]
*  already against them. Yeah, 1.5. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=450.66s)]
*  Right, so you put that group together, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=451.82s)]
*  we're talking about millions of people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=453.62s)]
*  And if you wanna look at the polling, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=455.5s)]
*  Brian and Carly, through the years, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=457.22s)]
*  these deportation ideas have been unpopular [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=458.98s)]
*  until very recently. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=461.74s)]
*  And I think the reason is the type of story [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=463.7s)]
*  that we led with. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=465.46s)]
*  In the subways in New York, people say, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=466.46s)]
*  get that type of person who has no right to be here [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=468.06s)]
*  harming our folks out of the country. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=471.18s)]
*  And now it's majority supported. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=473.62s)]
*  People are sick of this. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=475.1s)]
*  And you better believe that a majority of these people [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  are in sanctuary cities and states for obvious reasons. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=478.82s)]
*  And the Wall Street Journal has an interesting piece [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=481.14s)]
*  that was just released. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=482.9s)]
*  The editorial board asked, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=484.22s)]
*  are Democrats in sanctuary states [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=485.62s)]
*  trying to attract illegal immigrants [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=487.22s)]
*  to compensate all the people that are leaving, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  the legal people leaving their country? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=492.98s)]
*  Method to the madness? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=495.98s)]
*  Yeah, voting with their feet. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=496.82000000000005s)]
*  Look at these numbers. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=498.78000000000003s)]
*  So in California, 361,057 migrants moved in, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=499.86s)]
*  240,000 residents moved out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=505.5s)]
*  New York, 200,000 migrants moved in, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=509.02000000000004s)]
*  120,000 residents moved out. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=511.74s)]
*  Illinois, 112,000 migrants moved in, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=514.14s)]
*  56,000 residents moved out. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=516.66s)]
*  New Jersey, similar trend, 130 migrants moved in, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=520.26s)]
*  35,000 residents moved out. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=523.18s)]
*  So one of the things that they bring up is the census. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=525.86s)]
*  And illegal immigrants are counted in the census. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=529.5799999999999s)]
*  So if you have migrants moving into the country, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=532.06s)]
*  then the representation stays or increases [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  if more migrants move in than people are moving out. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=537.74s)]
*  I think it's a fair question to ask. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=539.78s)]
*  They want those residents to count for their numbers. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=541.14s)]
*  And by the way, the stats that we just put up [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=543.86s)]
*  on the screen there, that's what we know, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=545.62s)]
*  Because a lot of these people are living in the shadows. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=548.34s)]
*  So they're very specific looking numbers, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=550.42s)]
*  but I guarantee you those stats undercount [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=552.82s)]
*  the actual influx of illegal immigrants, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=556.58s)]
*  especially in the places like California. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=558.34s)]
*  And just by the way, they follow our news, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=559.7s)]
*  illegal immigrants, potential illegal immigrants, coyotes, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=561.74s)]
*  better than we do, right? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=564.74s)]
*  They have great, how many moves to the border [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=565.78s)]
*  are not happening now? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=569.62s)]
*  Because they know who's president, who's coming in. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=570.94s)]
*  So how many people are gonna go, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=573.54s)]
*  it's not worth it to sacrifice my house and my family [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=574.86s)]
*  to get those $25,000 to give to somebody [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=578.62s)]
*  who's gonna bring me to the border [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=581.66s)]
*  and then get me through and find those holes in the border. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=583.26s)]
*  Strong messaging might already be helping the situation. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=587.0999999999999s)]
*  Tom Homan in 15 minutes will be here [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=590.3s)]
*  because they know the flip side of this. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=592.5799999999999s)]
*  And the reason, back to your point, Guy, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=594.02s)]
*  the reason why more people are into mass deportation now, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=596.4599999999999s)]
*  I think is because they know you don't turn off [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=599.4599999999999s)]
*  the Hispanic audience and the Hispanic voters [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=601.8s)]
*  just because you're cracking down on the border. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  It was conventional wisdom, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=607.12s)]
*  you crack down on the border, wrong message to Hispanics. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=608.24s)]
*  And now they say, no, no, right message. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=611.12s)]
*  I came here the right way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=613.16s)]
*  And don't lump me in with people trying to break the law. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  And criminals, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=617.68s)]
*  They're like, we want the criminals gone. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  Who doesn't want the criminals gone? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO9739JYwPI&t=621.04s)]
