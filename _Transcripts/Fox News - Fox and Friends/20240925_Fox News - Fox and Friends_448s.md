# Jillian Michaels: It's despicable to politicize this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI)
*  The CDC estimates six in ten Americans are living with at least one chronic disease and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=0.0s)]
*  four in ten Americans are living with multiple. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=8.8s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=11.64s)]
*  And this week, health advocates including our next guest putting the spotlight on the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=12.64s)]
*  epidemic on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=17.16s)]
*  Monday watch. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  It's become harder and harder for people to take agency and enact change for the reasons [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=21.44s)]
*  we're laying out for you today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=28.48s)]
*  And ultimately I have discovered that despite my best efforts and the efforts of people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=29.76s)]
*  here like me, Americans need systemic help and they need it urgently. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=35.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=40.28s)]
*  The fitness app founder and host of keeping it real podcast, Jillian Michaels joins us [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=41.84s)]
*  now fresh off that testimony. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=45.84s)]
*  Jillian, first off, why do you think that America is ready to hear your message? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=47.64s)]
*  I think Americans have been ready for a real long time because they are impacted directly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=52.16s)]
*  One in 30 children now has autism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Early onset cancer diagnosis is going up 79 percent in the last 30 years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=61.0s)]
*  We all know someone, my friends, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal in their thirties. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=64.88s)]
*  I'm not here to bash you over the head and alarm you with the statistics because we all [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  know somebody. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=75.52s)]
*  We've all been impacted. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=76.52s)]
*  The bigger problem, if I could get on a soap box here, is that you guys are the only ones [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=78.12s)]
*  covering this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=83.36s)]
*  This is not a partisan issue. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the hell is going on, but all of these other media outlets that are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=87.88s)]
*  politicizing health and making it partisan should be ashamed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  It's despicable and disgusting and you do not use the health of Americans to be divisive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=97.55999999999999s)]
*  It's reprehensible and I cannot commend you enough. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=102.96s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having CaliMeans and the people like us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  Jillian, what are some of the things that we're feeding our children or some of the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=109.24s)]
*  things that we're doing on a daily basis that we don't even know is harmful? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=112.32s)]
*  Guys, at this hearing we had food activists like Food Babe and Jason Karp and when she [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  held up a bag of Froot Loops, which we don't want our kids eating anyway, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  But we're aiming for such low-hanging fruit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  She said this is what they give the kids in Canada. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=128.4s)]
*  These are the Froot Loops and it's colored with things like carrot and beet juice and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  here they're all artificial food dyes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=135.06s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=138.16s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=139.16s)]
*  Money, money. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=140.16s)]
*  And the answer is because it's more profitable because kids are drawn to it more. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=141.16s)]
*  What Jason Karp said as one of the speakers, he's like kids would probably do cocaine if [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=145.84s)]
*  we would let them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=150.24s)]
*  The key is we're not supposed to let them but as moms, you don't know what's in that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=151.76s)]
*  stuff. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=155.88s)]
*  It's all the stuff that's being sprayed on the food, that's in your water, that's in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=156.88s)]
*  your air that we can't control and this is the systemic help conversation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=161.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=165.4s)]
*  And we've got a statistic. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=166.4s)]
*  The American obesity rate right now is at 40 percent. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=168.36s)]
*  So 40 percent of American adults are obese. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=171.58s)]
*  That is, Jillian? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=174.96s)]
*  It's higher actually. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=175.96s)]
*  74 are overweight and obese. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=176.96s)]
*  Okay, so thank you for clarifying that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=179.1s)]
*  But that's something you can see. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  You can see I'm overweight. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=182.82s)]
*  The person is overweight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=184.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=185.86s)]
*  But it's the stuff, and that speaks to what you should eat, but it's the stuff you can't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=186.86s)]
*  see. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=190.94s)]
*  Like you were talking about the colorectal cancer or the pancreatic cancer. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=191.94s)]
*  The stuff inside. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=195.18s)]
*  Infertility is going up one percent every year. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=196.18s)]
*  The statistics are horrifying. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=200.78s)]
*  It's not a question anymore. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=202.62s)]
*  It is not nuanced. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=204.36s)]
*  It's simply right or wrong. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Good against evil. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=209.96s)]
*  And the reality is I can sit here and I can tell everybody, hey guys, you know, eat less [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  and move more and use common sense with your food choices. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  But the reality is that you can be thin and still get cancer and still get type 2 diabetes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=218.9s)]
*  I know this is a difficult question, but what is the solution? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=224.56s)]
*  Because the alternative takes hard work. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=228.3s)]
*  We've been talking about microplastics and all. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=233.76s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=234.76s)]
*  That takes a lot of work and it's not convenient at all, the steps that you have to take. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=235.76s)]
*  So what do we do? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=239.72s)]
*  Well individually we take action by simple steps. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=241.84s)]
*  Get an air purifier for your home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=245.94s)]
*  Get a water filter on your house. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  Try to get things in glass. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=250.18s)]
*  Don't microwave in plastic. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  Order from the Clean 15, which are foods that have less pesticides and chemicals, instead [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=253.72s)]
*  of the Dirty Dozen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=258.36s)]
*  Like simple changes like this, an orange instead of the raspberries because it doesn't have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=259.52s)]
*  as many chemicals on it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=264.0s)]
*  And then it's the job of people like myself, with the help of you guys, to force these [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=265.84s)]
*  companies to change. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=270.76s)]
*  And when you stop buying their products, this was really interesting, something else, another, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=272.28s)]
*  Jason Karp also said, he goes, these companies will react immediately if they see an impact [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=277.2s)]
*  on their bottom line. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=283.12s)]
*  When we stop buying their Froot Loops, they will change and they will give you the healthier [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=284.2s)]
*  formulation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=289.12s)]
*  Do you think it's still the case where the healthiest stuff is more expensive, so if [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=290.12s)]
*  I can get the Froot Loops cheaper and I'm on a budget anyway, I'm getting the Froot Loops, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=294.04s)]
*  and I can't go to Whole Foods because it just cost me too much. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=298.96s)]
*  You are absolutely right, and that's why the systemic change needs to happen because it's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=301.64s)]
*  dysfunctional legislature, like the Farm Bill, that is begetting this glut of cheap, empty [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=305.92s)]
*  calories that are covered in chemicals and pesticides, and then big food just turns [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=314.0s)]
*  into something about this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=319.24s)]
*  If we make a big enough deal and we hit them from all angles and we put them on blast and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=320.36s)]
*  we speak to the politicians and we put them on blast when they do the wrong things, I [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=326.04s)]
*  think we'll get there, we just have to keep fighting. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=333.68s)]
*  If Trump wins, RFK says he's going to put RFK in charge of the FDA or food supply, can [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=336.0s)]
*  he make a difference? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=342.32s)]
*  I mean, I personally really like RFK. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=344.32s)]
*  I think he's done incredible things over the course of his lifetime. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, he cleaned up your river over here pretty effectively. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  So he's going to put guys like Callie Means in charge of the FDA, and you will see heads [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  roll, I pray for that moment. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=358.04s)]
*  What you have said is terrifying a lot of people watching right now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  So people are going to go to the grocery store later today or sometime soon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=364.0s)]
*  Give us an idea of how to go shopping, is it you buy the organic stuff rather than, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  to Brian's point, where it's more expensive. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=376.64s)]
*  So what we want to do is go back to the old school advice, like first of all, you buy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=379.36s)]
*  in bulk. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=382.8s)]
*  Second, try to go to local farmers markets and get your produce locally. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=383.8s)]
*  It's more cost effective, has less chemicals. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=387.74s)]
*  Go organic where it counts, which is going to be dairy, beef, and thin skinned fruits [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=391.16s)]
*  and vegetables. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=396.24s)]
*  If you can't afford it, that's when you go to the thick skinned fruits and vegetables [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=397.24s)]
*  or what we call the clean 15 and you amortize those dollars. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=400.48s)]
*  But here's the thing guys, when we're talking about drugs like Ozempic, that's like $1,200 [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=404.84s)]
*  a month. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=411.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=412.0s)]
*  Somehow we're finding the money. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=413.0s)]
*  This is what I mean. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=414.64s)]
*  And they want to get it paid for by the government. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=415.84s)]
*  How about you take that money and you give people clean, healthy food. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=417.56s)]
*  Because you lose fat and muscle by the way too. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, you lose more muscle than fat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  So we can trust it when it says organic. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=426.96s)]
*  That's definitely better. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=429.12s)]
*  It's definitely better. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=430.12s)]
*  Is it perfect? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=431.84s)]
*  No. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=432.84s)]
*  Is it better without question yes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1gXq3TSZHI&t=433.84s)]
