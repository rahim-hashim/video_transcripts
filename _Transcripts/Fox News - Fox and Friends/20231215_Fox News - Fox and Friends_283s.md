# Jack Keane: I'm absolutely stunned at this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc)
*  Fox News Lord Ainsley, as Israel fights Hamas and Gaza, the terror threat appears to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=0.0s)]
*  going global. Listen to this. German and Dutch police say they've captured four Hamas members [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=4.48s)]
*  suspected of plotting attacks on Jewish institutions across Europe. Joining us right now, Fox News [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  senior strategic analyst, retired four-star General Jack Keane. General, we heard about [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=13.86s)]
*  the increased terror threat. We're worried about it here. They obviously have a reason [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=18.36s)]
*  to worry there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=22.22s)]
*  Well, certainly. We have every reason to worry about it. I mean, our FBI director has told [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=24.22s)]
*  us very much the same thing, that the threat has increased significantly. We've got an [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=29.76s)]
*  open border for sure that certainly is a way to accelerate that threat. You know, Hamas [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  is not as much of a foreign threat as Hezbollah is, but nonetheless, it's obvious they do [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=39.92s)]
*  have that capability. We're seeing it now in Europe. But the focus certainly is taking [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=45.96s)]
*  place on the Gaza Strip with the IDF, and that is where it should be. And we're in a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=53.52s)]
*  real tough fight there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=59.64s)]
*  We are. And General, what about the fact that Houthi rebels are trying to shut down the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=61.24s)]
*  sea lanes and rocketing us, and the only thing that our secretary of defense has given our [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=65.68s)]
*  Navy permission to do is knock down the rockets? When are we going to get on the offensive [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  there and start taking out the Houthis? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=75.08s)]
*  Yeah, I am absolutely stunned that we're still sitting there in a defensive mode. I mean, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=78.64s)]
*  obviously, we have the capability to defend ourselves. There's no disputing that. But [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=84.84s)]
*  to shut these people down, you have to take away their capability to do it. So you go [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=89.84s)]
*  after their rockets, you go after their missiles, you go after their storage sites, you go after [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  their entire command and control system. I mean, we have very good intelligence on the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=99.88s)]
*  Houthis, to be sure. And I also believe you go after the Iranians on this, because they're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  really calling the shots here. Make no mistake about it. Why we're still in this defensive [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=113.68s)]
*  role makes no sense to me whatsoever. I know there's a multitask force coming that will [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=120.68s)]
*  escort the ships, but even that, in a sense, is a defensive role. I mean, obviously, it's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  the right thing to do. I'm not disputing that. But take away the capability that they have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=131.36s)]
*  and punish them for what they're doing. Otherwise, they're going to keep doing it. Iran is going [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=137.16000000000003s)]
*  to keep telling them, shoot, shoot, and shoot. And that's just going to continue. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=141.84s)]
*  So the IDF has been told, I guess, through political lanes, guys, wrap it up. You've [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=148.08s)]
*  got a couple more weeks. Wrap it up. The intensity has got to ratchet down. That's the message [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  from this administration delivered by Jake Sullivan yesterday. What do you think the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=157.9s)]
*  Israelis will do with this urging? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, I really think that those kind of declarations are really more political considerations than [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  anything else. I don't think it relates to what is actually happening on the ground. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=173.62s)]
*  It must be the pressure that the administration feels dealing with this issue. And certainly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=178.52s)]
*  everybody understands the suffering that's taking place with the Gaza citizens and what [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=185.42s)]
*  the Israelis are doing with their grid system and telegraphing where they're going to go [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=190.42s)]
*  so the civilians can move out of there. I mean, that's unprecedented in warfare, as [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=195.5s)]
*  far as I'm concerned, and certainly puts their own soldiers at risk, likely one of the reasons [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=200.7s)]
*  the Israeli casualties are going up. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=205.9s)]
*  But Brian, this is a military campaign. It has military objectives, certainly, to eventually [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=208.66s)]
*  achieve a political objective, the removal of Hamas as a political entity. But the campaign [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=214.38s)]
*  itself, designed by the leaders in the IDF, they should be permitted to execute this campaign [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=220.46s)]
*  and finish the job. They know full well that more than half of Hamas fighters are still [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=227.46s)]
*  alive. They cannot bring this campaign to an end on a timeline set by somebody else. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=233.94s)]
*  It has to be based on conditions on the ground and destroying the effectiveness of Hamas's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=240.78s)]
*  military organization, which obviously also has terrorist capabilities. That is going [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=247.94000000000003s)]
*  to take time, and the time factor should be conditioned by the success that they're achieving [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=253.46s)]
*  on the ground, not by any artificial timetable and certainly not by political pressure coming [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=260.18s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=267.18s)]
*  Unfortunately, this president has a history of not listening to his military experts. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=268.34s)]
*  We see that played out on a daily basis. Someone's got to stand up and speak out. General, thanks [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=272.06s)]
*  so much for doing it. You tell the story better than anybody else. You got the facts. Appreciate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=277.14s)]
*  it. Have a great weekend. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z-MfeE2Gc&t=281.34s)]
