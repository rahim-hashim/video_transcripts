# Blue state governor joins Trump onstage at rally: 'She's doing the right thing'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc)
*  So the president United States yesterday one of the stops was to a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=0.0s)]
*  It was to a base for the Michigan Air Base [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=5.48s)]
*  Yes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Well the the air to announce the Selfridge Selfridge Selfridge Air National [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=11.44s)]
*  They're no longer gonna have the a selfridge Air National Guard base [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=14.96s)]
*  What happened is they lost the a 10 fighter mission and there was no replacement so governor Whitmer [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=18.92s)]
*  We've seen her go to the White House [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=24.2s)]
*  She and Donald Trump partnered up to secure a new fighter mission because all those people were gonna lose their jobs [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=25.479999999999997s)]
*  They were gonna lose 30 million dollars in wages [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=31.36s)]
*  So they came up with a plan to add 20 f15 exes at Selfridge in addition to the already planned KC 46 a's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  It's great for America. It's great for Michigan for our defense industry [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=41.44s)]
*  He was there the Secretary of Defense and governor Whitmer was there. She said yeah, it's something military. I'm gonna go [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=45.92s)]
*  She was invited which I think was great for the president to do that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=51.44s)]
*  But once again she ended up backdrop which I think is fine [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=54.36s)]
*  Other people don't and the president United States surprised her. Maybe it seems that way. Let's watch [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=58.44s)]
*  I want to thank governor Gretchen Whitmer for bringing it also to our attention very strongly [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=66.2s)]
*  And you know, I'm not supposed to do that. She's a Democrat. They say don't do that. Don't have her here [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  I said no, she's gonna be here. She's done a very good job frankly, so I want to thank you very much Gretchen. Good job [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=76.76s)]
*  Well, I hadn't planned to speak but I'm on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=84.36s)]
*  Serve so honorably on behalf of the state of Michigan. I am really damn happy. We're here to celebrate this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Recapitalization at Selfridge. Thank you. I'm so so grateful that this announcement was made today and I appreciate all the work. Thank you [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=98.16s)]
*  You know, first of all, she's doing the right thing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  She's doing what's best for the country but also what's best for her state I just wish she would [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=110.16s)]
*  appear comfortable [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Making the right decision. She's doing all the right things [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=119.08s)]
*  But when you see her knees these these visuals whether it was her shielding herself in the Oval Office or even there [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=122.56s)]
*  she seems uncomfortable with it because [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=129.16s)]
*  They have demonized Donald Trump so much. She was told right not to work with him, but she's doing the right [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=132.04s)]
*  Again, they know why she's at the White House. They know what she's doing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=138.34s)]
*  They're grateful for what she's doing for their defense industry [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=141.78s)]
*  However, if you live in other parts of the country and you you're not familiar with what's happening at Selfridge [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=144.86s)]
*  You might look at this and say what is she doing? Is she becoming a Republican? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  Why is she trying to be friends with the one man? We hate the most sure [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=153.5s)]
*  well when the president United States comes to your state and delivers the gift of these [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=156.9s)]
*  state-of-the-art [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=162.46s)]
*  15s you go out on the tarmac and you shake hands and you know, she was the reason she [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=164.3s)]
*  famously posed with that blue binder over her face in the Oval Office is because she didn't realize she was going to be [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=170.94s)]
*  part of a photo op but she was she was actually in the Oval Office to talk to the president about [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=177.5s)]
*  This Air Force base and also to explain how the tariffs were going to eat away at Michigan's car industry [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=184.46s)]
*  he the president dealt with the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=190.62s)]
*  The loss of the a 10s and the car industry in one fell swoop yesterday [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=193.62s)]
*  So she did what a lot of other Democrats 99% of Democrats won't do they don't want to be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=198.22s)]
*  Approximate to Donald Trump because their story is Donald Trump is bad. So if Donald Trump is bad [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=205.22s)]
*  Why would you ever go? But Alyssa's like Alyssa Slyclen sneaked by [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=210.38s)]
*  To get that Senate seat by actually saying good things about Donald Trump and governor Whitmer after [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=215.82s)]
*  When asked about what's happening in Michigan and the president winning said he's very popular in my state [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=222.54s)]
*  So here's some of the headlines and tears to understand [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=227.9s)]
*  It's a bit of a risk to appear if you're a Democrat with the president after an awkward photo [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=231.06s)]
*  Whitmer coaxes a win for Michigan out of Trump Washington Post gives her credit [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=235.38s)]
*  Whitmer just got what she wanted from Trump [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=240.14s)]
*  But she's making a risky bet and the AP about that hug Whitmer risk backlash from Democrats as she embraces Trump in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=242.14s)]
*  Michigan I think she holds strong you got everybody on the other side. She's center-left [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  She's showing she's center-left and you know something about her must be impressive because Joe Biden wanted to name her [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=253.78s)]
*  But then he was boxed in by Clyburn [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=260.74s)]
*  He had to pick someone of color and I know that President Obama was very impressed with Governor Whitmer, too [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=263.42s)]
*  And that was part of the jungle primary, but Brian. Do you see the headlines of them saying that it's a risk? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=269.38s)]
*  It's only a risk if the Democrats don't want to win if you want to win you need someone who proclaims to be a Democrat [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=274.3s)]
*  But also is a moderate in some senses but compared to Pritzker yesterday [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  Fight every step of the way exactly every public into the street that doesn't mesh with that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=287.42s)]
*  No, because what we see right there is she is putting her state above the party the pain [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=292.54s)]
*  Remember that's New York Times. That's the AP. That's the Washington Post [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  Those are national newspapers. If you read the local newspapers in Michigan, they have a different stance on this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=303.3s)]
*  They're so happy that they're working together to do it work. That's what happens when you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=309.34s)]
*  Bipartisan that's what it looks like. So you get things done [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  Would you say this Ainsley if you want to get the the message for the car industry when it comes to tariffs and it's a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=316.42s)]
*  Located Michigan you have a relationship with the president's president. I know what you're trying to do, but here's what Ford says [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  Here's what Chrysler says, you know, here's what GM is saying [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=328.32s)]
*  This is what the Union told me. Let me relay this to you. So I think there's the stakes are too high right now [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDbIAxzGUlc&t=331.34s)]
