# Butler County first responders to join Trump’s inaugural parade
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY)
*  Just six months after surviving an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, President-elect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump will be inaugurated as our 47th president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=5.64s)]
*  And nearly 100 first responders who saved lives that day are set to join his inaugural [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  parade. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=15.4s)]
*  Director of Emergency Department for Butler Hospital, Jenna Enskow, and County 9-1-1 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=17.12s)]
*  coordinating coordinator Rob McClafferty join us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=22.32s)]
*  Thank you all both for joining us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Jenna, first off, you know, it's sort of, it's been, you know, six months, but sort [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=28.0s)]
*  of still only six months. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=32.88s)]
*  Butler will forever be defined by what happened that day. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=35.44s)]
*  And I think you all were both on the scene. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=39.8s)]
*  Kind of tell us a little bit about that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=43.0s)]
*  Yes, good morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=45.6s)]
*  We were both at the rally site on July 13th. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=49.44s)]
*  We prepared for the day and planned as appropriately as possible, but you know, you never planned [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  for what actually occurred on that day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=60.24s)]
*  So we saw multiple patients throughout the day of heat-related emergencies, over 250 [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=63.96s)]
*  to be exact. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=72.48s)]
*  So I think that really caught us by surprise. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=73.48s)]
*  We expected to see many, but truly not that many. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=76.1s)]
*  So that was a very busy day for us up until the shots rang out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=80.08s)]
*  And then the feeling and the atmosphere at that point was very surreal and almost unbelievable. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=84.4s)]
*  Well, of course, Rob, part of what no one will ever forget is the life of Corey Comparatore. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=89.08s)]
*  And this parade on Monday will be partly to honor him, correct? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=97.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=104.36s)]
*  And that's certainly we're all humbled to be there, but that's our biggest, that's just [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=105.36s)]
*  the biggest thing for us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=110.96s)]
*  The biggest incentive for us to be there is just the opportunity to honor Corey's life [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=111.96s)]
*  and the fact that he gave all that day. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=115.76s)]
*  You know, Zig Ziglar has a fantastic quote about circumstances don't create character. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=119.36s)]
*  They really show character. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=125.48s)]
*  They reveal character. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=127.0s)]
*  And Corey was a hero before that day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=128.68s)]
*  It was just revealed that day. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=130.68s)]
*  So Jenna, I would imagine you obviously you all have how many people are going to be in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=133.08s)]
*  your part of the parade? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  There are almost 100 first responders from Butler County that will be attending from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  our facility. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=150.52s)]
*  Particularly there are four of us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=152.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=154.28s)]
*  And how has this changed Butler? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=155.28s)]
*  I think Butler has always been the small town, tight knit, very close community. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=161.48s)]
*  But I think the events of that day really have just brought us closer together. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, we are truly a hometown feel and we support each other. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=171.72s)]
*  And I think this just certainly has exemplified that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=176.68s)]
*  Well, you all both have become an important part of history, obviously, but remembering [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=180.44s)]
*  the events and remembering the heroes from that day is I think is a very important way [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=188.08s)]
*  to polish your place in history. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=193.96s)]
*  So thank you all both for that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  Jenna Enskow and Rob McClefford. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOOgkNCmmIY&t=200.52s)]
