# Jack Keane rips Biden admin for failing to confront Iran directly: 'Appalling'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc)
*  Iran's supreme leader signaling the possibility of renewed negotiations with the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=0.0s)]
*  over his country's rapidly advancing nuclear program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=5.18s)]
*  But the Pentagon says this doesn't change U.S. strategy in the Middle East. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in retired four-star General Jack Keane. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=11.82s)]
*  General, he says, telling, he told the civilian government there was no harm in engaging with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=14.26s)]
*  its enemy, will being the enemy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=20.06s)]
*  What's your read on why he's saying this now? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=22.54s)]
*  Well, I think it's a bit of political grandstanding and, you know, diplomatic diversion. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=26.14s)]
*  I mean, obviously, there's been focus on Iran in terms of the anchor, what they represent [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=31.94s)]
*  in destabilizing the Middle East. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  He's operationalized all of their proxies, 200-plus attacks on U.S. bases in the region, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=40.22s)]
*  shut down the Suez Canal using their Houthi proxies, and obviously supporting Hamas and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=46.38s)]
*  their attacks and supporting Hezbollah as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=54.26s)]
*  So this is trying to wave a fig leaf here in terms of diplomatic effort, but let's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=57.58s)]
*  see it for what it really is. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=63.26s)]
*  Iran is behind what is happening in the Middle East, and there's no walking away from that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=65.26s)]
*  It's appalling that the administration doesn't confront them directly. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=69.62s)]
*  But even when it comes to the nuclear deal, I mean, the Iranians have blown off the IAE [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=73.24s)]
*  inspectors, who are charged to go in and routinely look at the nuclear enterprise inside of Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=78.86s)]
*  They've destroyed the cameras that the IAE has left in place. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=84.22000000000001s)]
*  They don't want any part of some kind of a deal here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=88.66000000000001s)]
*  They're close to weaponization themselves. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  And that's the reality of what we're facing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=94.62s)]
*  This is a diplomatic diversion and a bit of grandstanding that's taken place byâ€”likely, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=96.98s)]
*  the new president is forcing this because he wants a better relationship with the West. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=103.5s)]
*  Right now, look at our assets in the region. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  It's got to be threatening. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=109.98s)]
*  We see we have two aircraft carrier groups in there ready to attack. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=110.98s)]
*  Iran probably knows that, so that's keeping them somewhat in check. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  You see our assets there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=118.66s)]
*  Costing us a lot of money, but that's what we do for our allies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=120.26s)]
*  If we can, General, let's focus on Ukraine. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=123.66s)]
*  We have President Zelensky basically begging the West, us, to allow him to move on Russian [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=126.36s)]
*  assets and Russian sites and stop with the restrictions, especially after their penetration [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=135.06s)]
*  into Russia, into Kursk. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=141.26s)]
*  Will he be successful? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=143.66s)]
*  Well, let's hope so. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=144.66s)]
*  I mean, this is appalling, what has taken place. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=147.66s)]
*  Look at the Russian air campaign that they just accelerated rather dramatically. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=149.78s)]
*  The worst results that the Ukrainians have suffered since the war began has just taken [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=155.26s)]
*  place with Russia's attack into eastern Ukraine, rather dramatic. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=161.02s)]
*  They intend to continue it, but yet we will not let the Ukrainians use our weapons to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=167.02s)]
*  fire back at the Russians. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=173.02s)]
*  Does this make any sense to anybody? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=175.52s)]
*  It's appalling how they're hamstringing the Ukrainians here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=177.62s)]
*  What the Ukrainians want to do is punish Russia as much as possible, take as much territory [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  can, prevent Russia from taking more territory in the Donbass region and go into negotiations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=187.26s)]
*  next year in the best possible position, leverage so that they can have influence in those negotiations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=194.06s)]
*  Right now, Putin doesn't want to go to negotiations because he thinks time is on his side. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=201.22s)]
*  And as long as the administration keeps stalling and protracting the war, and that's what [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=205.98s)]
*  restricting the use of U.S. weapons in the Ukrainians' hands is actually doing, slowing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  down Ukrainians' efforts to be able to gain leverage over the Russians makes no sense [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=216.94s)]
*  militarily, makes no sense politically, because we should be lined up behind Ukrainians, who [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=222.98s)]
*  now is publicly admitting he does want to go into negotiations, likely next year. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=229.62s)]
*  That's not something that he has been advocating in the past. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=234.78s)]
*  And clearly, the Kursk operation, where he's now sitting on as much territory inside of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=238.38s)]
*  Russia as Russia has taken from them in the last several months, that's the reality of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=244.42s)]
*  what has taken place here, and it gives him a tactical advantage in terms of diplomatic [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=249.96s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=255.66s)]
*  Let's support that and let's help him get more of that done. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=260.62s)]
*  And he's going to be here to personally plead to President Biden to allow him to do that, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=261.62s)]
*  because they're afraid, Biden is afraid of escalation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=266.18s)]
*  But clearly that has not been the problem, and the Ukrainians are paying the price. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=269.18s)]
*  General, thanks so much. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=272.46s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for accommodating me on a Wednesday as opposed to a Friday, guys. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=274.74s)]
*  No, you're helping us every time you're on the air, General. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305S-AyuoSc&t=279.90000000000003s)]
