*  This is a live look at Beirut as the IDF confirming they killed the head of Hamas's Lebanon branch [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=4.32s)]
*  And an overnight strike in the country [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=10.8s)]
*  So it comes as Israeli forces continue striking Hezbollah terror targets in Yemen and Lebanon [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=12.92s)]
*  All right, Nate for is in Tel Aviv with the latest Nate [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=19.2s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=23.92s)]
*  So just moments ago Hezbollah's deputy chief said if a ground invasion happens in southern Lebanon [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  Then Hezbollah will be ready for it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=30.36s)]
*  This as Israeli airstrikes continue causing massive damage not only to Hezbollah [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=32.44s)]
*  But also Hamas and the liaison between the two organizations [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=36.56s)]
*  The head of Hamas in Lebanon Fatah Sharif was taken out overnight in an airstrike in Lebanon [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  And so were militants from a different organization three of them in central Beirut an area that had not been hit to this point [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=47.12s)]
*  The conflict take a look at the damage from central Beirut as you can see the popular front for the liberation of Palestine [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Says that the strike hit the top floor of an apartment building [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=60.8s)]
*  But another strike from Israel yesterday sent an even bigger message to Iran take a look at this next video [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel hit Yemen's port city of Hadda [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=70.28s)]
*  This is retaliation after Yemen's Houthi rebels fired two missiles at Tel Aviv last week [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=72.72s)]
*  Israel hit its target from over [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=78.16s)]
*  1100 miles away, and that's roughly the same distance from Israel to Iran overnight an Israeli Navy boat intercepted a UAV [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=80.6s)]
*  Over the Red Sea Israel says the attack came from the east [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile Iran is reportedly helping Hezbollah select new leadership after an Israeli airstrike killed Hassan Nasrallah and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=92.08s)]
*  20 other terrorists on Friday Iran's Parliament met yesterday [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  And they chanted death to Israel and here I am Nasrallah take a look at this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=103.16s)]
*  So Iran's Parliament speaker vowed to continue fighting Israel and said the u.s. Must accept the consequences of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  supporting Israel so now we continue to await Iran's response after the killing of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=117.44s)]
*  Nasrallah there are reports from several different organizations that small Israeli groups [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=123.56s)]
*  Special forces are going into southern Lebanon to gather intelligence ahead of a possible ground invasion [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=129.76s)]
*  Defense minister Yoav Ghalan met with troops in the north just moments ago and told them [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  Killing Nasrallah was only part of the plan and them going into Lebanon may be the next part [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. Stay tuned for that Nate. Thank you very much the live report from Tel Aviv where it's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=145.4s)]
*  120 in the afternoon so Friday we get word that Nasrallah's bunkers been hit and there's no way he could survive but they need to the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=151.56s)]
*  Israelis are not confirmed until Saturday. What does it mean? So since 1992 this guy has been in charge [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  He has been looked at a hero and in indestructible and invincible mainly because in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=164.72s)]
*  When the Israelis tried to go in in the 80s and then again in 2006 they were unable to destroy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=170.56s)]
*  the Lebanese excuse me the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=176.8s)]
*  Hezbollah army, but they took tremendous losses and they had to back out and they said and since that time [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=179.72s)]
*  Hezbollah has been reinforced and reinforced to the point where they now have a hundred and fifty thousand rockets over the last year [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=185.52s)]
*  They aimed 80,000 rockets into Israel and they said no way is nothing's gonna happen to me last October [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=190.68s)]
*  Netanyahu knew where he was and he told the US I'm gonna take him out and last October the US says you better not so [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=198.76s)]
*  They didn't and guess what happened over the weekend on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Friday they took him out while the planes were in the air with the bunker Buster's on board [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=208.6s)]
*  80,000 tons they said we're about to kill Nasrallah [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=213.64s)]
*  Essentially we didn't ask your permission this time right exactly the thing to keep in mind [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=217.32s)]
*  Hezbollah is a terrorist outfit percent. They have so many people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=222.68s)]
*  So it's curious in the 72 hours since the announcement of his death [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  What some of the coverage has been and so we're gonna highlight some of that the Associated Press [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=232.56s)]
*  Said that he was considered a pragmatist, but amidst the fact that Hezbollah murdered a lot of Americans [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=237.56s)]
*  Yeah, hundreds of Americans there was a bombing of US Marines barracks in Beirut in 1983 and in addition to hundreds of Americans dying [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=244.4s)]
*  48 French soldiers died as well. Look at the next one seen as a father figure [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=252.32s)]
*  Nasa [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Nasrallah Hezbollah leader and force in the Middle East is killed then the New York Times saying he had the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=259.04s)]
*  Propensity to crack jokes. I mean are they moronic? I mean these are that a joke. I mean, it's just crazy [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=266.32s)]
*  I don't remember them talking about bin Laden as a jokester [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=272.52s)]
*  It's unbelievable and he's equivalent to bin Laden for the Israeli people and all also to us as well [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=276.64s)]
*  I saw over the weekend that there's this RT [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=283.24s)]
*  Station, of course Russian television and they bring on this supposed to be journals and she breaks out crying when this happened [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=286.68s)]
*  I mean, do we not understand the terror that he's brought to families all over the world including the American people? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=294.4s)]
*  Hellas Hezbollah over the last few years has alienated the Arab world the Gulf States burying people live in Syria came in on a side side [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=302.52s)]
*  And they were cheering in many factions of the Arab world throughout the Middle East [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=309.38s)]
*  And Iran all the pressures on Iran right now now you're the big brother. You said you're gonna watch their back Hamas [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=313.52s)]
*  You're gonna watch their back Iran. Go ahead [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=319.56s)]
*  But give it a shot because Israel's saying just try it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlxW3rFW4Y&t=322.15999999999997s)]
