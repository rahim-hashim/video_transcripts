# 'SEISMIC SHIFT': Key voting bloc backs Trump in crucial state
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo)
*  Time to prioritize our nation's best interests and foster lasting peace for all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=0.0s)]
*  This current administration has failed miserably in all aspects of humanity. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=6.8s)]
*  We look to Trump, to a Trump presidency with hope, envisioning a time where peace flourishes, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=12.08s)]
*  particularly in Lebanon and Palestine, maintaining the integrity of our borders. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=18.04s)]
*  Donald Trump meeting with Arab-American voters in Dearborn, Michigan, who are now throwing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=24.44s)]
*  their support behind him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=28.88s)]
*  This comes as the candidates remain neck and neck in that all-important battleground state. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=30.779999999999998s)]
*  You just heard from our next guest, Michigan resident Albert Abbas, and he joins us now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=36.28s)]
*  Albert, it's so great to have you on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=42.36s)]
*  I was just telling my co-host here, I'm obsessed with this story. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=44.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to end with a rally in Michigan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=49.32s)]
*  I think that Arab-Americans might be the swing demo inside of Michigan that could put it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=52.8s)]
*  in Trump's corner. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=59.56s)]
*  Explain to us why Donald Trump is appealing to, I'm sorry, why Arab-Americans are attracted [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=61.08s)]
*  to Donald Trump at this moment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=68.88s)]
*  Arab-Americans are flowing in the direction of the Trump campaign because of his words [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=70.84s)]
*  of tolerance and love and ending wars. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=80.72s)]
*  All our families are suffering overseas in Gaza and in Lebanon, and we have to stop the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=85.4s)]
*  indiscriminate bombings that are happening and allow justice for everyone and allow everyone [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=91.16s)]
*  to live with dignity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=95.52s)]
*  Diplomacy is the way for peace. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=99.12s)]
*  We can't expect that dropping bombs is going to create peace. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=101.2s)]
*  We have to open the gates so that we can have conversations with people that we agree with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=103.82s)]
*  and people that we don't agree with, and that's the most important thing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=112.46s)]
*  He's extended an olive branch to the Arab community. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=116.05999999999999s)]
*  He's made it a priority to come here, and he's said some very powerful words to gain [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  that support. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=125.85999999999999s)]
*  Now we're going to be looking for some actions and to hold everyone accountable, but we do [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=127.13999999999999s)]
*  believe that Donald Trump is our best option and a good option if that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=130.9s)]
*  Albert, I'm curious what this shift represents. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=135.38s)]
*  I'm going to ask you two questions. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=138.66s)]
*  Is this going to be the first time then that you have voted for a Republican? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=140.5s)]
*  Have you been a supporter of Democrats in the past? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=144.02s)]
*  That's one question real quick, Albert, and then the other is in your estimation, in your [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=149.06s)]
*  community, are there a lot of people who are following your lead and now going over to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=153.78s)]
*  Donald Trump? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=157.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=158.66s)]
*  There's definitely a seismic shift in favor of Donald Trump here in Dearborn and across [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=160.62s)]
*  Michigan in general, and I do believe Michigan is going to be the deciding factor in this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=166.66s)]
*  election and people are starting to wake up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=172.46s)]
*  It is not my first time voting for a Republican, and it's not probably my last time voting [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=176.74s)]
*  for a Democrat if they continue to go on this path. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=182.9s)]
*  As Dearborn voters, we want to be heard. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  The person that wants to listen to us and wants to reciprocate the love and tolerance, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  then we are going to shift towards that candidate, and today that candidate is Donald Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=200.26s)]
*  He's made some great gains over here in Michigan. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  I actually have a picture right here of my father with Ronald Reagan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=211.66000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you can see it, but this was back in the 80s when he had good relationships [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  with Ronald Reagan and the Speaker of the House of Lebanon and he helped bring back [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=227.34s)]
*  the American hostages at the time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=233.38000000000002s)]
*  And now our goal is to make sure that we end the wars everywhere, and we're asking Donald [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=235.86s)]
*  Trump not only to demand an end to the war, but to demand it the day that he steps in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=241.26s)]
*  office. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  No more killing, no more bombing, just peace around the world and love and tolerance. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  Just one quick question. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=253.26s)]
*  Masad Boulos, who is Tiffany Trump's father-in-law, he is of Lebanese descent, how much, I've [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=254.26s)]
*  heard that he was, for the last year, working the Dearborn area, working Michigan, how much [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=261.9s)]
*  has that been of an impact on the community and their vote, or their leaning towards Donald Trump? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=268.5s)]
*  It definitely doesn't hurt to have such an outstanding gentleman in Mr. Trump's family. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=274.1s)]
*  It gives us a vote of confidence that our voices will be heard. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=281.38s)]
*  It's good that his family has the diversity that the Democrats always speak of, but they [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=285.7s)]
*  don't really tolerate when we want to speak out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Boulos has been an outstanding person, has supported us, has provided us with the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=295.94s)]
*  lines of communication within the Republican Party, and has allowed us access to develop [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=304.14000000000004s)]
*  these relationships and build these bridges with the Republican Party, who has, quite [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=309.98s)]
*  frankly, been absent from Dearborn and Michigan in general for our people so that our voices [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  can be heard. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=320.66s)]
*  The only thing that we're asking as a population is for us to be respected and heard. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=321.66s)]
*  Don't take our votes for granted, and hopefully we can continue on this ride for peace and prosperity. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=326.74s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=338.74s)]
*  You have a blessed day. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=339.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=340.74s)]

*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzbLLq9Ssuo&t=342.74s)]
