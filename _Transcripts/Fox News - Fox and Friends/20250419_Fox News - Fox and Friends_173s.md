# Hollywood tried to prep Biden with mock debate, ended in ‘disaster’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE)
*  All right, well, we've been talking all day about Hollywood's involvement in Democrat [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=0.0s)]
*  politics and how they just weren't able to pull it off, at least not this time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here's a Wall Street Journal headline, even Hollywood couldn't save Biden. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=11.88s)]
*  And they say Joe Biden received advice from Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg before [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=16.28s)]
*  his June debate against Donald Trump, according to a new book by Chris Whipple. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=20.8s)]
*  Charlie, I mean, first of all, OK, so what are these Hollywood guys, what kind of advice [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=26.28s)]
*  do they have to give anyway? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, exactly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, like it's fantasy world. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  And so they specialize in fantasy world. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=35.56s)]
*  And I think that Joe Biden and the entire Biden presidency was kind of part of fantasy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=37.56s)]
*  world in a lot of ways. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=41.64s)]
*  But what's really interesting about it, we've always known that Hollywood was on the side [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  of Democrats. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=46.44s)]
*  But the degree to which Jeffrey Katzenberg was on the side of Democrats, he was on the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=47.44s)]
*  side of the Democrats. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=51.2s)]
*  But the degree to which Jeffrey Katzenberg set up a mock debate stage at Camp David for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=52.2s)]
*  Joe Biden to prepare for his debate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=60.2s)]
*  And it was such a disaster that he was not able they did it for like an hour and then [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  just closed it all down and took the you know, Jeffrey Katzenberg took his set home. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  And then, of course, Joe Biden winds up on stage in the real lights under the under the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=74.36s)]
*  bright lights. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=79.62s)]
*  No one will forget that if your actor is has dementia or is drunk or whatever, I mean, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=81.04s)]
*  you can't fix that with with Steven Spielberg. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  Right. And remember, he prepped for nine days. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=88.92s)]
*  So for nine days, our commander in chief was hunkered down at Camp David playing drama [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=91.68s)]
*  with these big lists, big a list directors. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=97.72s)]
*  And I think that like sort of underscores the point of the Biden administration's focus [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=100.64s)]
*  the whole time. It was always on Hollywood, the celebs, the big name, totally ignoring [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=104.92s)]
*  the American people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=109.44s)]
*  Why wasn't he practicing policy? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=110.12s)]
*  Why wasn't he interviewing the American people? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=111.96s)]
*  What is important to you? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=114.64s)]
*  What have I done that you've enjoyed? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  And then talk about that. The whole point is they were practicing the theatrics, the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=117.56s)]
*  sham that he kept committing to. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=120.6s)]
*  But obviously, that's it's such a great point, Emily, because what a contrast to Donald [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=123.08s)]
*  Trump, who is literally the complaint about Donald Trump is we can't train him for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=126.16s)]
*  debate. He's not going to listen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=130.8s)]
*  He's going to do what he thinks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=133.68s)]
*  And that authenticity is what came through. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=135.4s)]
*  Now, in the case of Joe Biden, what came through was dementia. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=138.0s)]
*  And the greatest moment of that debate, as you recall, was like Donald Trump going, I [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=141.44s)]
*  don't know what he said. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=145.96s)]
*  And frankly, I don't think he does either. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  It was at that point we all knew. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=149.56s)]
*  I remember I was at a debate party for Fox Nation with with with some of my co-hosts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=151.8s)]
*  And you were there, Charlie. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=156.8s)]
*  You were there, too. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  And we all just said, OK, it's over. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=158.84s)]
*  But I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nEbKO9gUyE&t=161.4s)]
