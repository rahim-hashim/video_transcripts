# ‘IT’S INSULTING:’ Border Control Council VP responds to Selena Gomez ‘crying’ clip
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ)
*  Welcome back to Fox and Friends, the White House responding to the now deleted viral [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  video of actress Selena Gomez weeping over mass deportations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=6.72s)]
*  The administration posting a video featuring angel moms Patty Moran, Alexis Nangare, and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=11.88s)]
*  Tammy Nobles. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=17.92s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=18.92s)]
*  You don't know who you're crying for. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=19.92s)]
*  What about our children who were brutally murdered and raped and beat to death and left [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=23.48s)]
*  on the floor by these illegal immigrants? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  I just feel like it's a ruse to deceive people and to garner sympathy for lawlessness. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  I wish I could do something that I can. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=39.08s)]
*  My daughter was a child. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=42.94s)]
*  There's many other children whose lives were taken due to people who crossed here illegally. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=44.6s)]
*  They didn't cry for our daughters. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=49.16s)]
*  You didn't cry for our daughters. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=52.4s)]
*  Well said. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  Here to discuss is Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council Art Del Cueto. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Art, I have to tell you, and I've interviewed many of these moms, other relatives associated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=62.16s)]
*  with these children's deaths, and that's the exact reaction I had when I saw that video. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=70.44s)]
*  Where was Selena Gomez when these children, when these women were brutally murdered? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=76.42s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=82.5s)]
*  And listen, not to sound insultive, but I had to look her up because I didn't really [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=84.94s)]
*  know whether she was an actress or a singer. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=87.7s)]
*  So I apologize for that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=90.06s)]
*  But realistically, where was she? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=92.54s)]
*  I mean, where were a lot of these actors? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=93.98s)]
*  Look, it's insulting because I see a lot of these Latino actors and singers that live [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=95.66s)]
*  in the United States, California and Florida. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=99.9s)]
*  They were doing the big outcry that said if President Trump wins, they were going to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=102.72s)]
*  either move to Canada or Mexico. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=106.44s)]
*  I haven't seen them pack their bags, but some of these individuals sure are doing a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=108.24s)]
*  lot of these little videos to try to boost their ratings and get more likes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=112.0s)]
*  But the reality is, it's what it is. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=115.66s)]
*  They're on a soapbox. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=117.88s)]
*  They're looking for ratings. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=118.88s)]
*  They really don't care about this country, and they don't care about the actual victims [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=119.98s)]
*  that have been brutalized by the illegal aliens that have come into this country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=123.24s)]
*  We know that you've been doing your job, Art, because you don't know who Selena Gomez [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=126.8s)]
*  is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=130.36s)]
*  I'm not on the job. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=131.36s)]
*  That said, I have to give kudos to the administration, to the Trump administration, to their communications [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=132.88000000000002s)]
*  department for not letting that go by, to engaging in the culture, to calling Selena [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  Gomez out directly for this and using the moms and their own words to counter that message. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=145.96s)]
*  So I really give a lot of credit to the Trump administration for not just letting that go [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=155.96s)]
*  by and letting Hollywood and these actresses who have private security and face none of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=160.92s)]
*  the issues that say a little Jocelyn Ngarry, a Mexican-American girl, who just went to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  the corner store and ended up brutally raped and her body discarded under a bridge. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=177.66s)]
*  I want to talk to you about this too, Art, because these mass deportations are underway [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=178.66s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=184.94s)]
*  And apparently, people are warning illegals using TikTok about the raid so they can evade [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=186.04s)]
*  these raids. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  What do you know about this, and what can be done about that use of TikTok? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  I think we just got to remain vigilant. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=201.44s)]
*  Look, it's been happening for quite some time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=202.88s)]
*  Even the criminal cartels the last four years, they were using TikTok, they were using Instagram, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  they were using any means of social media to recruit kids, to help them smuggle, to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=209.92s)]
*  bring more people down to the border, supplies, whatever it may be. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  So it's not surprising. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=218.76s)]
*  These groups are going to continue to utilize anything at their disposal in order to further [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=220.12s)]
*  their criminal enterprises. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=224.48s)]
*  It's something we've been seeing for quite some time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=226.92s)]
*  In fact, I think some of the intel guys within the different agencies should start monitoring [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=229.04s)]
*  those and then try to counterattack and throw them off of where they're actually going [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=234.04s)]
*  to be. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=238.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's interesting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=239.48s)]
*  Use TikTok to actually throw them off the scent and get them another way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=240.6s)]
*  For those who haven't seen these TikTok warnings, here's what it looks like. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=244.84s)]
*  Hey there, I am in search of Florida cute winter boots, 129. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  I do see that Orlando and Tampa have great cute winter boots. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday, there were spottings of ice cream trucks in Orlando at several different locations. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  I've heard some people say in Winter Park. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=267.44s)]
*  I've heard some people say Boggy Creek. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=269.8s)]
*  And I've heard some people say South John Young Parkway. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=272.04s)]
*  OK, so what you see there is they're using these names. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=276.08s)]
*  Winter boots is another name for ice so that they don't get, you know, it's a code for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=280.92s)]
*  it, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=287.0s)]
*  Or ice cream trucks. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=288.0s)]
*  Can ice and other law enforcement do anything about this? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=290.64s)]
*  Look, you're not going to combat that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=295.44s)]
*  You're going to have these people that are going to just continuously go out there because [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=298.04s)]
*  they want to interrupt, you know, the actual law enforcement that's out there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=300.6s)]
*  But it's winter boots, whatever names they're using. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=304.08s)]
*  Look, I grew up on the border. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=307.64s)]
*  I was used to hearing Chile verdes every time you saw Border Patrol. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=308.8s)]
*  La migra. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=312.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=314.36s)]
*  Art, listen, you are in a situation now where finally what you've been advocating for, for [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=315.36s)]
*  such a long time, is finally happening. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=322.6s)]
*  I just want to give you a last word before we close this interview on what you think [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump has done so far. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  Look, first and foremost, he's put America first, and that's a big deal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=332.16s)]
*  It's just sickening that you're going to have individuals out there that are going [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=338.36s)]
*  to attack him, attack law enforcement and say, you know, they're anti-immigrant, that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=341.0s)]
*  they're racist. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=345.16s)]
*  No one's anti-immigration. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=346.16s)]
*  We're pro-immigration, but we need to be doing it the right way. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=347.16s)]
*  There's a vetting system. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, we're anti-smuggling. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=352.8s)]
*  We're anti-child trafficking. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  We're anti-drugs coming into our country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=356.16s)]
*  That's what we're anti. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=358.0s)]
*  And first and foremost, we care about this country, just like President Trump has shown. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=364.08s)]
*  He's pro-Angel bombs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=365.08s)]
*  It's about time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=366.08s)]
*  Thank you, Art Del Queto. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=367.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=370.56s)]
*  You got it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Wo_eYDQsQ&t=371.56s)]
