# Lawrence Jones: European leaders are 'freaking out'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0)
*  All right, a little bit of breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=0.0s)]
*  The UK Prime Minister, Starmor, will reportedly meet [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=1.36s)]
*  with the US President Donald Trump next week in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=4.12s)]
*  DC after saying he is open to sending British troops [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  This comes as the French President Macron gathers [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  major European leaders for an emergency summit in Paris [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=14.88s)]
*  today to discuss security. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=17.56s)]
*  And President Trump on the global stage, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=19.76s)]
*  former Trump Deputy National Security Adviser, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=21.76s)]
*  KT McFarland joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=24.36s)]
*  KT, good morning to you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=26.64s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=30.76s)]
*  So let's talk about the freak out on the world stage. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=31.6s)]
*  The President is trying to start a negotiation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=36.16s)]
*  to end a war. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=38.64s)]
*  He talked about this on the campaign trail, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=40.4s)]
*  and yet they're freaking out. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=43.04s)]
*  And I guess the question is why? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=45.16s)]
*  I don't think they ever believed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=49.36s)]
*  President Trump would really do this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  I mean, President Trump has said his legacy [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=51.8s)]
*  is as a peacemaker. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=53.92s)]
*  So what's he trying to do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=54.96s)]
*  He's trying to bring a rapid end to the Ukraine war. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=56.08s)]
*  The Europeans and frankly, the Biden administration [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=58.64s)]
*  for years has said we can't have a negotiated solution [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=61.64s)]
*  to that Ukraine war because we can't trust Putin. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=64.56s)]
*  Therefore, let's not negotiate. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=67.6s)]
*  Therefore, America, we expect you to shoulder the burden [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=69.2s)]
*  of any defense Ukraine is going to do. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=73.2s)]
*  And for the British Prime Minister [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=75.0s)]
*  and the French President to be saying, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=76.64s)]
*  look, America, you've got to do more. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=79.32s)]
*  When they're not willing to do more, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=81.04s)]
*  it's just the height of hypocrisy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=83.2s)]
*  Yeah, so to that point, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=85.36s)]
*  this is what the UK Prime Minister is saying. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=86.48s)]
*  He said, it's clear Europe must take a greater role in NATO [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=88.64s)]
*  as we work with the United States [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=92.8s)]
*  to secure Ukraine's future. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=94.2s)]
*  And face down the threat we face from Russia. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  So he's saying that he's willing to send troops to Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=100.08s)]
*  President Trump has already said that's not an option [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=105.4s)]
*  for the American military though, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=107.32s)]
*  No, come on. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=111.4s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the Prime Minister of Great Britain [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=112.24s)]
*  is the one who's cutting their defense budget. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=115.12s)]
*  So put your money where your mouth is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=117.12s)]
*  If you really expect that you're going to play [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=118.6s)]
*  a major role in defense of Europe, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=121.16s)]
*  you ought to be contributing to the NATO budget. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=122.88s)]
*  You ought to be increasing your defense spending. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=125.32s)]
*  And that's the suggestion that the British [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=127.36s)]
*  are going to put troops on the border of Ukraine [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=129.68s)]
*  or troops in Ukraine is what troops? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=132.36s)]
*  Really, you don't really have that big of military anymore. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=135.2s)]
*  And the thing that you're gonna do somehow without NATO, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=138.12s)]
*  you're gonna act on your own to send a military [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=140.92s)]
*  you really don't have that much of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=142.72s)]
*  to a war that you can't possibly win. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=144.12s)]
*  Again, I think it's just hot air they're blowing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=146.12s)]
*  It's silly and I don't think the British people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  would appreciate that as well. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=151.12s)]
*  Let's talk about the negotiation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=153.56s)]
*  There seems to be this division in the media [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=155.72s)]
*  that they're trying to create between the president [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=159.12s)]
*  and Zelensky saying if he's gonna be a part [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=160.6s)]
*  of the negotiation or not the president, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump responded to that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=165.16s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=166.72s)]
*  Well, we're working to get it done. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=168.52s)]
*  I mean, it's too bad it started. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=170.08s)]
*  It would have been a lot easier to end it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=172.28s)]
*  before it started, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=173.84s)]
*  Because if he's gonna go on, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=175.32s)]
*  that would have been a big problem for us. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=176.56s)]
*  And that would have caused me a big problem [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=179.04s)]
*  because you just can't let that happen. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=181.04s)]
*  I think he wants to end it and they wanna end it fast. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=183.2s)]
*  Do you expect Zelensky to be involved in these conversations? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  What will his role be? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=191.76s)]
*  Yeah, I do, I do. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=192.6s)]
*  He will be involved, yes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=194.32s)]
*  Zelensky wants to end it too. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=195.84s)]
*  Of course he's gonna be involved. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=198.2s)]
*  And KT, we know that Putin was the aggressor here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=199.24s)]
*  No one is dismissing that, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=202.48s)]
*  but none of the world leaders wanted to talk to the guy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=204.56s)]
*  And Donald Trump is saying we gotta talk with him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=207.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, how do you have a peace agreement? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  You have to talk to the opposition, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=214.44s)]
*  the guy you're fighting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=215.92s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't mean that Putin is a good guy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=216.76s)]
*  It doesn't mean that he wasn't the aggressor, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  but there is a deal to be done. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's with Vladimir Putin, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=221.72s)]
*  not with all the British heads of state [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=223.56s)]
*  and all the other countries who are not contributing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=225.28s)]
*  to the common defense. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=227.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's why the president is saying we just want peace. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  I even want to get rid of some of our nuclear, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=232.36s)]
*  but we gotta have the conversation [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=234.4s)]
*  to start that negotiation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=236.2s)]
*  KT, thanks so much for getting up this morning. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Lawrence. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=241.36s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QMAu5F_GL0&t=242.2s)]
