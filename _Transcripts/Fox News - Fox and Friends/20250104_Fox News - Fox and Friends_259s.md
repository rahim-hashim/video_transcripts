# This was lawfare against Trump: Jonathan Turley
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs)
*  A more legal drama for president-elect Trump, as New York judge Juan Marchand sets a sentencing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=0.0s)]
*  date in that trial for January 10th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=6.0s)]
*  That's of course just days before Trump's inauguration. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  The president-elect slamming that judge, who donated to Joe Biden, by the way, along with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=11.92s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  This was an interview with Fox Digital. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump said, quote, this is a political witch hunt by Biden and the DOJ. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=19.28s)]
*  They want to see if they can get a pound of flesh because every case has failed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=22.8s)]
*  Fox News contributor and George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley joins [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=27.92s)]
*  us this morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=32.54s)]
*  Good to see you, professor. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=33.54s)]
*  You and I talked about this case on the radio yesterday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=34.54s)]
*  I understand Trump's upset about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=37.92s)]
*  I think he's broadly angry that this case was brought in the first place. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=39.44s)]
*  But in terms of this specific outcome from the judge and this sentencing that's coming, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=42.84s)]
*  you don't necessarily think this is totally bad news from Trump's perspective. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=48.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's been a remarkable change of events. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  This was portrayed as the virtual trial of the century. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=57.26s)]
*  And we're now looking at an unconditional discharge without any jail or probation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=62.46s)]
*  It's like marking down a hurricane down to passing flurries. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=68.96s)]
*  I mean, it's quite a change. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=73.17999999999999s)]
*  But more importantly, by sentencing Trump, the president-elect will finally have the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=77.4s)]
*  ability to appeal the case. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=83.34s)]
*  This case is riddled, in my view, with reversible error. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=85.86s)]
*  The president's right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=88.86s)]
*  This was lawfare. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  It's been denounced not just by CNN's senior legal analyst. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=91.42s)]
*  It was announced recently by a Democratic senator who said it was total BS. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  Many people in the public view it that way. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  So this will be the final rallying call of lawfare. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=103.5s)]
*  But he will not have that orange jumpsuit moment that many people had wanted. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=108.22s)]
*  He will walk out of that courtroom, either physically or virtually, and he will walk [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  into the White House just 10 days later. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=121.0s)]
*  So Professor, legal analysts seem confident that the judge has indicated here that there's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=125.72s)]
*  not going to be any punishment attached to this sentence when this proceeding happens [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=131.28s)]
*  days from now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=135.8s)]
*  Why are people feeling that way? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=136.92s)]
*  What is that clue or that indicator from the judge? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=138.84s)]
*  Well, I did the coverage of the trial. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=142.16s)]
*  And after the verdict, I said that this was the most likely result because not just because [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=144.64s)]
*  of the nature of this case, but most defendants in this position as first offenders would [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=149.61999999999998s)]
*  get this type of unconditional discharge. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  But after the president was reelected, it made that all the more likely. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  If the judge does not impose limits on his freedom or some type of probationary conditions, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  it basically defuses the constitutional issues. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=172.22s)]
*  Part of the problem here, though, is the timing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  Why this judge waited so long? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=178.7s)]
*  There's a suggestion in the order that if the president appeals and the sentencing is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=182.2s)]
*  delayed, that Mershon may just leave this in abeyance, suspend it for four years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=190.18s)]
*  That would be a perfectly horrific result. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=196.7s)]
*  It would allow this trial judge in New York to hold a leash on the American president [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=199.5s)]
*  for four years. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=205.7s)]
*  It would allow the media to continually portray him as a convicted person who's awaiting sentencing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=206.7s)]
*  But there is that chance that if Trump appeals and it's delayed too much, Mershon may carry [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=214.94s)]
*  out that implied threat. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=221.74s)]
*  Yes, the lack of that occurring, right, and some finality coming to this on January 10th [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=223.78s)]
*  could then allow Trump to go, get sworn in, go about his business as president of the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=230.86s)]
*  United States, and then his team elsewhere can fight on that appeals front that you were [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  talking about. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=239.78s)]
*  I know you've been very vocal that you think that there's ample grounds for appeal on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=240.78s)]
*  reversible error, so we'll be following all of that in the days to come. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=244.0s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, thank you so much. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIGnczybegs&t=247.26000000000002s)]
