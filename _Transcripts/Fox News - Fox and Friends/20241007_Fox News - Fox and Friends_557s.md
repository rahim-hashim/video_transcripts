# JD Vance: 'This is incompetence of the highest order'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk)
*  Today marks one year since the October 7th massacre by Hamas where nearly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=0.0s)]
*  1,200 people were murdered and more than 250 others were taken hostage. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=5.0s)]
*  Former President Trump and Senator JD Vance will both participate in events [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=8.84s)]
*  marking the one-year anniversary today. Republican vice presidential nominee [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=13.72s)]
*  Senator JD Vance joins us now. Senator, where were you a year ago when you [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=17.44s)]
*  heard the news and one year later where do you think this conflict is at? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=22.8s)]
*  Yeah, when I heard the news a year ago I had just woken up of course because the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=28.92s)]
*  the time difference and you were hearing reports about this really really brutal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=33.92s)]
*  attack and you know my wife and I have a couple of friends who actually live in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=37.64s)]
*  Israel, make it make their life in Israel. So first of course our thoughts go to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  our friends and how are they doing and then as the news rolls in you just [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=44.2s)]
*  realize how unbelievably gruesome it was and I think on this this year [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=47.7s)]
*  anniversary what we should try to remember is that there is true [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  barbarism in the world, there is true evil in the world and when the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=54.52s)]
*  good guys are against the bad guys America should try as much as we can to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=59.6s)]
*  support the good guys and unfortunately what we've seen from the current [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=63.6s)]
*  administration is a lot of wavering, a lot of waffling and I think because of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  that it's prolonged the war, it's gotten a lot of people, civilians on the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=70.08s)]
*  Palestinian and the Israeli side unnecessarily killed and it's made it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  harder to achieve any real peace in the Middle East. It really drives home why we [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=77.88s)]
*  need stronger and much smarter leadership in the White House. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=82.16s)]
*  Well you have Donald Trump who's saying that Israel should target Iran's nuclear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=85.32s)]
*  infrastructure but when Kamala Harris was asked about it on this 60-minute [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=88.72s)]
*  special that's going to air tonight they released a little clip of it. She [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=92.48s)]
*  couldn't say that she was an ally of Benjamin Netanyahu's. What was your [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=95.48s)]
*  response to that? Well I think that it just drives home again Kamala Harris's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=99.8s)]
*  entire approach to this this crisis has been to with the one hand say well maybe [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=105.76s)]
*  we kind of support Israel and then with the other hand actually pursue policies [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=111.4s)]
*  that prolongs the war. If you actually want peace in the region, if you want to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=114.92s)]
*  preserve civilian life and most importantly if you want to enable [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=118.84s)]
*  Israel to build the kind of long-term security for itself in the region then [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=122.24s)]
*  you have to support policies that will get the war over as quickly as possible. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=126.84s)]
*  On things like holding back precision guided weapons that would both destroy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=130.8s)]
*  the Maas bad guys but also minimize civilian casualties Kamala Harris has [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=135.56s)]
*  sort of been at the forefront of threatening to stab our allies in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=140.0s)]
*  back and because of it we have a war that has gone on for much longer than it [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=143.8s)]
*  should have. Frankly if the Israelis weren't able to do what they do best I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=147.8s)]
*  think this thing would have been over months ago and we could have been on the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=151.52s)]
*  pathway to rebuilding a Abraham Accords a Middle Eastern peace process that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=154.66s)]
*  unites Israel with some of its Arab neighbors to provide a counterbalance in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=160.52s)]
*  the region to Iran. What we have now is unfortunately Iran is empowered their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=165.36s)]
*  richer than they've ever been before and they are emboldened to attack not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=169.8s)]
*  just Israel but a lot of really important American assets in the region, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=173.8s)]
*  American economic interests and unfortunately it's all been emboldened [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=178.86s)]
*  and all been encouraged by Kamala Harris's weak leadership. Senator I want [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  to ask you about North Carolina. There are a lot of there's a lot of debate a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=187.0s)]
*  lot of conflicting reports about whether or not money is coming from FEMA money [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  spent on illegal immigrants or the resettling of migrants and could that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  have gone to the American people in need in North Carolina. There's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=199.28s)]
*  conflicting reports and there's debate about the responsiveness as well of FEMA. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=202.96s)]
*  You've done a good job of separating and talking about the priorities I think of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=206.56s)]
*  the American government. My question for you is how would you and Donald Trump in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=210.4s)]
*  a situation like this ensure that you live up to what you have talked about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=215.04s)]
*  that we place Americans first? Yeah well I mean first of all you have to separate [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=219.88s)]
*  what people are saying they'll say well there's a bucket of money in FEMA that's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=226.48s)]
*  gone to illegal aliens and that's somehow separate than the bucket of money that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=230.24s)]
*  should by right go to American citizens. I think that misses the fundamental point [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=233.84s)]
*  that the Biden-Harris administration has turned FEMA effectively into a agency [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=237.8s)]
*  that helps to resettle and helps to deal with illegal immigration. That is just [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=243.28s)]
*  fundamentally going to distract focus from their core job of helping American [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=247.48s)]
*  citizens in their time of need. I think the fundamental mistake that Kamala [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=251.68s)]
*  Harris's administration has made here Will is that from the get-go you should [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=255.8s)]
*  have imposed military style command and control. You've got eight different [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  bureaucratic organizations, you've got a lot of different bureaucratic fiefdoms [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=264.56s)]
*  that sometimes delay the provision of necessary resources. You need to empower [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=268.16s)]
*  a military commander on the ground to get helicopters to where they need to go, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=273.68s)]
*  to get supplies to where they need to go, to cut through some of the FAA [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=277.64s)]
*  bureaucracy when it comes to you know planes and helicopters landing in the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=280.88s)]
*  right place. The problem here I really believe is just it's like the DMV at [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=284.8s)]
*  industrial scale and because of it a lot of folks in North Carolina are suffering [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=289.88s)]
*  unnecessarily. I hope to God you don't have unnecessary loss of life but I fear [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=294.8s)]
*  that we do and it all goes back to why do we have a president and a vice [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=299.12s)]
*  president one of whom is on the beach, the other of whom is [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=303.64s)]
*  participating in fundraisers rather than doing their job. It is incompetence of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=306.76s)]
*  What Donald Trump would do if he was president is impose real leadership, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=312.4s)]
*  force the bureaucracy to be responsive not at a bureaucratic pace but at a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=317.12s)]
*  business pace to the needs of American citizens that's how you save lives and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=322.0s)]
*  limit needless suffering. Well I can tell you I know I guess they have to go back [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=326.08s)]
*  to the Senate if they want to change buckets of where the money is going to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=329.6s)]
*  go but if you look at FEMA spending they put 1.4 billion dollars on migrants. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=332.44s)]
*  Shelter service 640 million, emergency food services 780 million. I think that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=336.72s)]
*  that is obscene. I think that that's got to stop and I imagine you guys are going [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=342.48s)]
*  to attack that right away. Never before. The other thing is just use the army. The [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=346.56s)]
*  army's an hour away. They can organize anything. Fort Bragg is sitting there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  They're waiting for the call. Nine days later they get a call. They're there [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=356.88000000000005s)]
*  already turning everything around and they are getting a pass. She went to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=361.04s)]
*  campaign trail. He stayed on the beach. They don't call the army for seven days [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=366.16s)]
*  and can you imagine if you guys were in power and you did that that's all they'd [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=370.44s)]
*  be talking about. Well Brian we'd get attacked and rightfully so because when [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=375.24s)]
*  leadership fails they should get attacked and Kamala Harris has been a [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=381.04s)]
*  complete failure of leadership. Think about this. In 2010 there was a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  terrible earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The 82nd Airborne was on the ground [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  two days later. There was a disastrous hurricane an hour away from the 82nd [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=392.36s)]
*  Airborne's headquarters. It took more than a week for the full deployment to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=397.76s)]
*  arrive and start helping people out. It's a complete lack of leadership. When [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=401.88s)]
*  things like this happen you need somebody in charge. You need somebody [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=406.04s)]
*  saying we're gonna save as many lives as possible. Red tape be damned. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=409.6s)]
*  Unfortunately what you've had is somebody asleep at the wheel. Nobody [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=413.6s)]
*  knows who's in charge and I think it has delayed the provision of necessary [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=417.36s)]
*  resources to the people of North Carolina. They're angry, they're sad, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=421.4s)]
*  they're heartbroken. You talk to a lot of folks and this is a region, the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=425.32s)]
*  Appalachian region of our country, that has been ignored by leaders for 40 years [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=428.84s)]
*  and they really feel ignored today. The way you solve that problem is by having [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  leaders who show up and focus on the people. Kamala Harris has failed to do [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  that. Well Donald Trump was at that rally in Butler on Saturday. I personally would [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=441.28s)]
*  be scared to death to go back to that place. He spoke too. I know and that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=445.84s)]
*  crowd was huge. It was massive. We've heard anywhere between 20,000 and 100,000. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=450.6s)]
*  We've read different reports but look how big that crowd is. What was it like [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=455.64s)]
*  and what's your response to, I mean PA is such an important state for this [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=458.72s)]
*  election. Well first of all it was incredible energy. It was a celebratory [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=462.8s)]
*  mood but it was also bittersweet of course because Cory Compertory of course [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=468.8s)]
*  lost his life at the last Butler Pennsylvania rally. I spoke with his [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=472.72s)]
*  sisters, I spoke with his wife and his daughters and you know there is just [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=477.04s)]
*  this tension between we're so happy to be there in Pennsylvania but we're so [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=480.8s)]
*  sad that Cory Compertory is no longer with us and I think that what Donald [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=485.92s)]
*  Trump and I take from that is you have incredible people who are not just [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgERBGfZ1Yk&t=489.68s)]
