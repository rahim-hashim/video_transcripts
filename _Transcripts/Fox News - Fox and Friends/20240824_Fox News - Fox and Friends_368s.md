# Kevin O'Leary: This may prove to be a huge mistake for the Democrats
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs)
*  Kamala Harris is now pretending to endorse my policy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=0.0s)]
*  She's got a lot of other policies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=5.3s)]
*  She's just—she's a copycat. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  She's a flip-flopper. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=10.32s)]
*  She went from communism to capitalism in about two weeks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=12.32s)]
*  But in fact, Kamala cast the tie-breaking vote to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go after [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=17.64s)]
*  your tip income. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=26.2s)]
*  Donald Trump calling out Kamala Harris for copying his no-tax-on-tips plan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=28.64s)]
*  But the vice president says she's for the middle class, even though she backed the Inflation [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=34.32s)]
*  Reduction Act, which gave the IRS more power to go after service workers' hard-earned money. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=38.8s)]
*  Here to react is Shark Tank investor and O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=45.2s)]
*  Or as we know him, Mr. Wonderful. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=50.28s)]
*  It's great to have you on, Kevin. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  So you know, they say that imitation is the best form of—highest form of flattery. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=53.84s)]
*  So I guess she's imitating Donald Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  But why would you buy the imitation if you could have the real deal? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  Well, this policy, no question, was introduced by Trump first. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=65.2s)]
*  And why it's so popular for both parties is this is a reflection of the post-pandemic [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  digital America 2.0 gig economy, because so many people in America, not just in Nevada, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  all around the country have side gigs on the Internet. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=82.36s)]
*  And they work as Uber drivers or they're in the casual food or fast food business. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=85.63999999999999s)]
*  And tips matter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  So this is an effect to really get them interested in making more money through reducing their [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  taxes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=96.0s)]
*  It's not a big give in terms of what it's taking away from the federal pot of tax collection, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=97.0s)]
*  but it's powerful in the sense that it recognizes that this generation care about this in a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  big way. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  And I expect it has some ramifications for vote getting, for sure. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=109.04s)]
*  Yeah, no question about it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, Kevin, I was in Allentown, Pennsylvania, interviewing people as they were coming out [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  of grocery stores, very working class town. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  I was surprised at how many people had second and third jobs just to make ends meet that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=119.68s)]
*  they just got them over the last couple of years. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=125.04s)]
*  And these are service jobs or they're driving an Uber car. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  All of these tip incomes that depend on tips for them and to make their their their incomes [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=131.48s)]
*  stretch and their money stretch to help their families. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  So this is a very big issue for them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=143.72s)]
*  We're seeing credit card debt. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=146.32s)]
*  Thirty four. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  I think it's hitting a trillion. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=149.72s)]
*  And then middle class income has been lost. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=151.12s)]
*  Thirty four thousand dollars in real wage growth loss for middle income people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=154.12s)]
*  So this is a big deal. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=158.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think tax policy really matters. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=160.56s)]
*  And of course, we need more details. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=162.84s)]
*  We've come through the Democratic Convention policy light. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=165.32s)]
*  There's some big vision statements, but I'm really encouraged that now the focus has to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=169.8s)]
*  come into detail starting September 10th, even if she doesn't take an interview before [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=173.72s)]
*  then, you can't avoid the debate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=178.36s)]
*  But I would think by now she's got to start explaining because remember, I'm an investor [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=181.12s)]
*  and I represent a group of people that have to invest regardless of it in the White House. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=184.76s)]
*  So we need policy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=188.56s)]
*  We need policy and energy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=190.24s)]
*  We need policy on taxation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=191.44s)]
*  We need policy on a wide range of issues, including the border security on energy in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  terms of how it's deployed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=198.8s)]
*  Housing is a big one. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=199.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm in the real estate business. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=201.24s)]
*  Her housing policies don't make sense. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  And so we'd like to hear some more detail on that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=206.0s)]
*  Housing is determined at a state mandate level. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=208.4s)]
*  And so for her to say she's going to build three million homes, I'd love to understand [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=211.4s)]
*  how that's going to happen, because I don't believe it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=215.4s)]
*  I like detail. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=217.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, Kevin, she's running a social media campaign. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=218.52s)]
*  It's kind of an AI campaign. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=221.28s)]
*  She's not taking any interviews. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=222.84s)]
*  We're on day 34 now without that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  What can Donald Trump and J.D. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  Vance do to keep this policy focus so they can talk about the economy, talk about her [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=228.56s)]
*  position on energy, talk about her position on inflation and even the price control? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=233.8s)]
*  She still hasn't explained that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  So this election now is boiling down to voters in seven states. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  So swing voters, they care about policy more than anything else. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=246.04s)]
*  They're sitting waiting for more information. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=249.28s)]
*  So if Trump just stays on mandate with policy, he's pretty clear on what he wants to do on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=251.6s)]
*  energy border, foreign affairs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=257.32s)]
*  He's delivered messages on that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=259.96s)]
*  I can expect that Harris will do the same soon. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=262.24s)]
*  They're the people that are going to decide. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=265.0s)]
*  And I think now is the time to start focusing on that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=267.2s)]
*  We're down to 70 days and we still don't know what's going to happen here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=269.64s)]
*  I'll add one other element to this, and I think it's a narrative you started exploring [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=273.52s)]
*  today, and it's been over the last two days I've been hearing it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=276.96s)]
*  If, in fact, Harris loses and it's 50-50, she may win, she may lose. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=280.0s)]
*  This whole party, the Democratic Party, is going to revisit what happened here because [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  they did the same thing with Hillary Clinton. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  It was assumed she would win. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  They anointed her. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=294.68s)]
*  She lost. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  Harris is assumed a winner by anointment. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  If she loses, the party will never do this to itself again because they missed the opportunity [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=301.48s)]
*  to run a process and suck up another week of air time and they didn't do it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying she's going to lose, but I would have never let that happen if I'm [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=311.52s)]
*  selling a business. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=315.28s)]
*  I tell my managers, never bring me one offer. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=316.28s)]
*  Bring me a process. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=319.84s)]
*  Show me there's no other bid out there that I want. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=321.56s)]
*  Then I'll make a decision if I'm selling. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=324.38s)]
*  I was amazed they didn't do that here because Newsom made reference to it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=326.2s)]
*  There may have been other candidates or she could have emerged much stronger, but they [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=330.16s)]
*  didn't do that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  That may prove to be a huge mistake. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=335.72s)]
*  Well, you're a free market guy and you're talking about competition and that's something [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=337.68s)]
*  Democrats don't like. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=342.12s)]
*  You're darn right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=345.24s)]
*  Thanks for bringing it down to what it really is about. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=346.24s)]
*  And you're right, if she loses, there's going to be a real come to Jesus moment in that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  party. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=353.0s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=354.0s)]
*  Love having your point of view. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=355.0s)]
*  Thanks, Kevin. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  Kill me. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_lWS5AlZs&t=359.32s)]
