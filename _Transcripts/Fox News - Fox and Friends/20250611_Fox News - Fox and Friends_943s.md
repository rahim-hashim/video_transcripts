*  Governor Gavin Newsom decided to deliver his own address. It was very much in a presidential style [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=147.32s)]
*  No doubt with an eye to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=153.44s)]
*  2028 and Gavin Newsom once again took the Trump administration to task listen here this administration is pushing mass [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=155.96s)]

*  indiscriminately targeting hard-working immigrant families regardless of their roots or risk [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=166.4s)]
*  What's happening right now is very different than anything we've seen before [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=172.44s)]
*  And guys we're just less than one hour from this first curfew being lifted now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=179.28s)]
*  And we'll wait to see if the protesters come back onto the streets of LA today back to you guys [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=184.28s)]
*  Jonathan for the most part when does when do you start seeing the stirring? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=190.36s)]
*  I mean here it is what five in the morning there when you start seeing the stirring of the protesters what time roughly? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=194.12s)]
*  Usually Brian the protesters start gathering around 10 11 in the morning, so we're about five hours from that point [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=201.88s)]
*  So that's when we would expect to see them [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=209.36s)]
*  We're checking all the social media channels as always to see where and how they are organizing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=211.36s)]
*  I've not seen any calls for them to get out on the streets as of yet today, but it's very early here in LA [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=217.6s)]
*  Jonathan I always wonder how can someone spend day after day protesting don't they have jobs don't they have to go make money? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=223.76s)]
*  But then we're learning that maybe some of them are getting paid to do this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=230.88s)]
*  Yeah, there is certainly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=236.36s)]
*  organization behind [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=238.36s)]
*  These protests and you've heard the LAPD chief Jim McDonald say quite plainly [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=239.92s)]
*  That the people causing the violence causing the real problems here have nothing to do with the cause of immigration [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=245.32s)]
*  They are in the words of the police chief a professional anarchist who that the police here have seen [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=252.04s)]
*  During the George Floyd riots during during the anti Wall Street riots and so on and so on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=259.84s)]
*  These are the same characters according to the police chief who keep coming out and have nothing on their minds [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=264.48s)]
*  But violence and mayhem right not even embedded in the cause. It's just [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=271.24s)]
*  Thank you, right. So you got the homeless nonprofit? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  Homeless nonprofit is handing out PPE for people as is the LA Poverty Department healthy hearts [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=280.24s)]
*  You would think is there for for people who need to eat instead. They're weighed into left-wing politics [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=286.2s)]
*  They're looked at as a left-wing group supporting them and sure all the coalition for humane immigration rights [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Not only got 1 million from Joe Biden's DHS, but also takes money from the Chinese [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  They're all over it and Republicans are investigating 200 NGOs that might be promoting these illegal immigrants [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=302.32s)]
*  What's the ideology as well? I'm sorry. You got people in the cafes pro-hamas rhetoric that is there [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=308.88s)]
*  I don't know how that what that has to do with immigration [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=314.64s)]
*  But they're promoting that as well [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=316.68s)]
*  And then I even heard some of the protesters with some of the interviews saying okay [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=318.2s)]
*  We have the Mexican flag here because this is really Mexico [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=322.92s)]

*  We don't know how they spend the money, but that's American dollar [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=347.28s)]
*  Those are American dollars and President Trump was free speaking at Fort Bragg. He said you want to burn the flag [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=350.71999999999997s)]

*  I got to ask you in that case regarding California. I know it's gonna be [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=861.72s)]

*  I think it's our Lawrence. I think it's our [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=887.64s)]
*  170th lawsuit who's counting against the federal government since Donald Trump has been in office [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=890.52s)]
*  But sure we're prepared to defend it because we are prepared to protect our law enforcement officers out there and we are tight [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=895.72s)]
*  Entitled to do that under the law and that's another reason Lawrence why one big beautiful bill needs to get passed [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=902.6s)]
*  Because we have no tax on overtime for law enforcement officers and we will continue to protect our law enforcement [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=909.04s)]
*  We need funding for law enforcement and that's why it's so important also from a law enforcement perspective [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=915.6s)]
*  It's a big issue. LA is dealing with assurances of cops. So I'm sure they can use the money as well [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=921.12s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, we thank you so much for always being transparent with us. Thank you Lawrence. You got it [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dti9BGEB_3k&t=926.6800000000001s)]
