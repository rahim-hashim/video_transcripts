# Hamas reportedly agrees to free some hostages
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ)
*  Hamas reportedly agreed to a tentative deal to free dozens of hostages, many as 70, pending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's approval. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=6.54s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, as we learned, the deal may have been rejected. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=7.54s)]
*  They also want Palestinian prisoners out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=11.28s)]
*  This comes as the total number of attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East climbs [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=13.92s)]
*  to 57, and a U.S. destroyer shoots down a drone from Yemen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=18.6s)]
*  The Houthi rebels seem to be armed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=23.0s)]
*  I wonder why Iran did that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=24.6s)]
*  Here to react, former Green Beret and leader of Task Force Pineapple, retired Lieutenant [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=26.36s)]
*  Colonel Scott Mann. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Colonel, great to see you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  First off, your thoughts as a war fighter when you hear you might have to have a five-day [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=32.88s)]
*  pause for a possible release of 70 hostages. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=36.96s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=40.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, obviously being mindful of the fact that negotiations are underway right [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=41.12s)]
*  now, I mean, you can't take your eye off of Hamas for any period of time just based on [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=45.04s)]
*  the nature of how they operate and the fact that they're, you know, putting men, weapons [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  and equipment inside hospitals. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=54.92s)]
*  So it's going to have to be an unblinking eye on them no matter what's going on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=56.88s)]
*  When you're trying to take down a terrorist force, how difficult is it also to take videotape [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=60.84s)]
*  and sell your side of the story to the world? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=67.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's going to become more and more clear that this is a narrative war, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=71.44s)]
*  This is a war about narrative. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  And I don't think we've ever seen a war quite like this where in real time Israel is having [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  to give footage to the rest of the world to demonstrate that they are applying surgical [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=83.8s)]
*  precision in what they do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=88.52s)]
*  That's going to continue for them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=90.16s)]
*  That's not going to stop because if they don't, the propaganda machine of Hamas will overtake [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=91.28s)]
*  them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=95.52s)]
*  I know you've seen a lot of horrible things in this world, especially extracting what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=96.52s)]
*  was left of our allies in Afghanistan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=99.12s)]
*  But can you imagine the mindset of a terrorist who would kill parents in cold blood in front [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=101.68s)]
*  of the three-year-old and take a three-year-old hostage? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=107.34s)]
*  I think one of the things I'm most concerned about right now is that migration of ISIS [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=109.92s)]
*  style tactics that we saw on October 7th. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=113.48s)]
*  And I think as Americans and as Westerners, we need to be very mindful of that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=117.2s)]
*  There is a very real possibility that that migration of tactics locally could find its [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=121.0s)]
*  way here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=124.76s)]
*  I am a little concerned about our guys, 45,000 in the region, 2,500 in Iraq, 900 in Syria [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=125.76s)]
*  being targeted 54 times in three and a half weeks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=133.88s)]
*  We've hit back four times. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=137.04s)]
*  How hard is it to sit there and hope the missile defense saves your life and the concussion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=138.44s)]
*  doesn't wreck your brain? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=142.96s)]
*  Yeah, and you're going to, you know, the TBIs of our forces are really going up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=144.36s)]
*  And when you have this kind of footprint, when you have this escalation, increased footprint, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=149.28s)]
*  and you're facing asymmetric threats like these precision drones, our guys and girls [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=153.52s)]
*  are really at risk. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=157.18s)]
*  So we're going to have to have rules of engagement that reflect their force protection. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=158.18s)]
*  Otherwise we're going to see these kinds of asymmetric attacks continue to escalate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Why was it important for you to come to the Patriot Awards? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=166.4s)]
*  Well, because this is a community-based approach. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=168.88s)]
*  One of the things that I saw with Pineapple Express and the other volunteer efforts is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=171.68s)]
*  what our country is capable of to this very day at the community and individual level. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=175.46s)]
*  That's where leadership comes from. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=180.44s)]
*  It doesn't come from top-down government. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=181.6s)]
*  It comes from communities. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=183.24s)]
*  And Fox really brings that out and it's just fun to come watch it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=185.24s)]
*  Scott, great to see you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=188.24s)]
*  Thanks for all you do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=189.24s)]
*  A round of applause for Lieutenant Colonel Scott Manz. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=190.24s)]
*  By the way, the president in Booker T is now out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=192.96s)]
*  Look who Janet Westling just got me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  She's the cover of the book and now I can have something to drink coffee out of. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=200.6s)]
*  So did you, Carly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=204.04s)]
*  I hope to see everybody in person at 5.30 tomorrow at the Grand Ole Opry. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=205.04s)]
*  I'll be signing here actually tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Also take a look at the other full screen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=212.6s)]
*  I'm also going to be in the area in Brentwood, Tennessee, as well as Chattanooga, Tennessee, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=214.56s)]
*  Madison, Alabama, and Montgomery, Teddy and Booker T. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=221.64s)]
*  Hope to see everyone in person and also Fox Nation sponsoring all of it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDKYGMyRXQ&t=224.92s)]
