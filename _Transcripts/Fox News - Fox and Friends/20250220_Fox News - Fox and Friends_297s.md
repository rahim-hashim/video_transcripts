# NEW: Hamas releases bodies of four murdered hostages
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0)
*  A Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=0.0s)]
*  Overnight, Hamas terrorists releasing the bodies [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=1.44s)]
*  of four innocent Israeli hostages brutally murdered [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=4.08s)]
*  after being kidnapped from their houses more than a year ago. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Among them, the terrorists say, are the two youngest [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=11.36s)]
*  and most recognized victims, Kfeir and Ariel Bebas, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=14.56s)]
*  just two and four years old, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=18.68s)]
*  and their mother, Sheree, also coming home [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=20.96s)]
*  to Israel in coffins. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Fox News contributor, Katie Pavlich, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  has been to Israel since the attacks, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=28.52s)]
*  and she joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=30.36s)]
*  Good morning to you, Katie. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=31.38s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=33.78s)]
*  Good to see you. Good morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=34.68s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=35.64s)]
*  These were the most recognized victims [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  of the hostage situation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=38.2s)]
*  Their pictures were all over New York City. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=39.36s)]
*  We were all praying for them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=41.32s)]
*  And we found out this news. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=42.6s)]
*  What was your reaction? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=44.2s)]
*  Well, it's just a stark and terrible reminder [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  of why this war started on October 7th. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  You had not Hamas terrorists necessarily [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=52.92s)]
*  kidnapping this beautiful family, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=56.08s)]
*  but civilians who, when the gates of Gaza [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=59.24s)]
*  were broken down by the terrorists, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=62.12s)]
*  they entered looking for looting opportunities [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=64.44s)]
*  and found this family and kidnapped them [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=66.96s)]
*  and took them back to the Gaza Strip [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=68.96s)]
*  and held them hostage for 500 plus days. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=71.24s)]
*  If you look at the ages of these children, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=76.48s)]
*  one of them is obviously a baby, one is a toddler. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Their father, Yarden, on the day of October 7th [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=81.48s)]
*  went out to fight to save his family. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  He was also taken hostage and released [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  ahead of this horrific exchange. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=89.5s)]
*  The Israeli government is exchanging a number [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  of convicted terrorists to get this family back [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=94.98s)]
*  and their bodies back. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  And of course, we don't want to show it, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=99.94s)]
*  but Hamas is doing their typical celebration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=101.34s)]
*  and ceremony today, acting like this is somehow [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=104.18s)]
*  an equal trade and you have hundreds, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  if not thousands of Palestinian civilians [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=110.66000000000001s)]
*  lining the streets in Gaza cheering as this is going on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=112.9s)]
*  So there are still a number of hostages [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=117.22s)]
*  who are still being held, including an American hostage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=118.86s)]
*  President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Whitkoff, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=122.62s)]
*  will be back in Israel at the end of the week [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=125.06s)]
*  to try and get him out of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=127.3s)]
*  But it just really goes to show you [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=130.78s)]
*  what these barbaric terrorists are capable of. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=132.26s)]
*  And taking hostages in this way and killing them [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=135.74s)]
*  is a war crime and taking children hostage [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=138.3s)]
*  is also a war crime and there should be consequences for it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=141.1s)]
*  And the man on the right side of the screen, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=143.74s)]
*  his name is Odin. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=145.22s)]
*  He was the fourth body that was brought back [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=146.38s)]
*  and he is 83 years old. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=149.18s)]
*  I can't imagine what he went through at that age. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  He and his wife were kidnapped [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=153.04s)]
*  and his wife was released alive. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=154.3s)]
*  But the other ones on the screen that you see, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=156.34s)]
*  they were cheering and children of Hamas, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=159.22s)]
*  they were cheering too as the coffins were being [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=161.74s)]
*  given to the Red Cross and then over to the military. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=164.78s)]
*  And then now their bodies are in Tel Aviv [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=167.54s)]
*  and the family spoke out and said [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=169.66s)]
*  they really didn't want to comment more [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=171.1s)]
*  until the bodies are tested just to make sure [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=172.78s)]
*  they are identified. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=175.62s)]
*  But Katie, this is three generations [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=176.7s)]
*  because Cherie's parents were killed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=179.1s)]
*  in their kibbutz on October 7th. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=182.26s)]
*  Then she was kidnapped, her husband was kidnapped, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=184.3s)]
*  she comes back in a coffin and so do her two babies. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=186.78s)]
*  And so that's three generations that have been lost [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=189.78s)]
*  because of evil. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=193.14s)]
*  When you were there, when you were visiting, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=194.82s)]
*  you saw their pictures hanging up in the airport, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=196.82s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=199.3s)]
*  Yeah, so in the airport in Tel Aviv, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  they have all of the photos of the hostages on posters [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=203.46s)]
*  and the Bebas family, they have their posters there as well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  And you can see that Cherie and her husband, Yarden, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=210.94s)]
*  are on one poster together and their children in the front. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=214.3s)]
*  And those posters come down when hostages are returned. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  And these hostages, unfortunately, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=221.22000000000003s)]
*  will not be returned alive. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=223.86s)]
*  Yarden is now a widower and his children were murdered [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=225.08s)]
*  by this horrific act of barbarism and terrorism. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=228.14s)]
*  And I just wanna say something about Odin as well, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=231.77999999999997s)]
*  the fourth hostage body who has returned. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  He spent his life as an Israeli peace activist [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  driving Gazans to and from Israeli hospitals to help them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=240.05999999999997s)]
*  And a lot of these kibbutzes, which I've also visited [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=245.38s)]
*  before and after the war started, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=248.38s)]
*  they are full of people who are trying to have [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=251.17999999999998s)]
*  a peaceful solution and living in coexistence. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  They employed Palestinians in their homes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=256.66s)]
*  They drove them to the hospital for medical care. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=258.94s)]
*  And they are repaid for those good deeds [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=261.26000000000005s)]
*  by Hamas terrorists and civilians [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=264.36s)]
*  storming their homes on October 7th, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  taking them hostage, murdering them, burning them alive, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=268.66s)]
*  and taking babies like the Kfir children [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=272.04s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip and returning them in a body bag. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=275.1s)]
*  And so it really just goes to show the depraved nature [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  of the way that these terrorists have behaved [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=282.5s)]
*  and a number of people inside of Gaza [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=284.98s)]
*  who have been cheering this on for more than a year now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  And sad to know that Israel had to trade terrorists [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=289.82s)]
*  in order to get these babies' bodies back. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much, Katie. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovixXsk8wx0&t=295.62s)]
