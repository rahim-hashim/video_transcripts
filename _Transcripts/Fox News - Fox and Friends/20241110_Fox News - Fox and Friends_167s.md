# 'BAD ADVICE': Psychiatrist slammed for controversial advice on Trump voters
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o)
*  If you are going to a situation where you have family members, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=0.0s)]
*  where you have close friends who you know have voted [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=3.4s)]
*  in ways that are against you, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=7.74s)]
*  like what you said, against your livelihood, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=9.34s)]
*  and it's completely fine to not be around those people [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=12.34s)]
*  and to tell them why. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=16.12s)]
*  You know, to say, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=17.38s)]
*  I have a problem with the way that you voted [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  because it went against my very livelihood, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=20.82s)]
*  and I'm not gonna be around you this holiday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=23.46s)]
*  I need to take some space for me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=25.42s)]
*  A Yale psychiatrist arguing, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=28.12s)]
*  if you disagree with your family, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=30.12s)]
*  then you are the bad guy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=32.42s)]
*  You should just cut them off, cut them out of your life. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=35.76s)]
*  But is this the best advice heading into [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=38.5s)]
*  the Christmas season? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=41.06s)]
*  Here to discuss is Fox News medical analyst, that's good. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=42.34s)]
*  We need some, yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  I think you're the right person, Dr. Sapphire. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=46.34s)]
*  This is bad medical advice that politics, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=48.18s)]
*  the issue here is not your politics, it's your family. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=52.7s)]
*  Cut them out. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=56.42s)]
*  Yeah, well, so good morning, guys. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=58.82s)]
*  First of all, I do wanna put the little caveat here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=61.32s)]
*  The woman that was being amplified on this network, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=63.66s)]
*  she isn't actually a practicing physician. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=66.38s)]
*  She's still in her training, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=68.3s)]
*  which means that she's never actually seen patients [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=69.52s)]
*  without being under the supervision [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=73.06s)]
*  of an actual practicing physician. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=74.6s)]
*  But ignorance and lack of experience [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=76.66s)]
*  certainly are not an excuse and can cause harm. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  When the Biden appointed Surgeon General [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=81.88s)]
*  in the last couple of years [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=84.38s)]
*  has declared a loneliness epidemic. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=85.46s)]
*  Loneliness is rampant across our country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=88.16s)]
*  It was fueled by COVID, by our digital technology. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=90.36s)]
*  And loneliness is not only associated with depression, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=93.6s)]
*  anxiety, suicide, it also is related to physical ailments [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=96.38s)]
*  such as cognitive decline, dementia, heart disease, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=100.78s)]
*  diabetes, and other things. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=103.74s)]
*  So this is bad advice, especially heading into the holidays [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=105.42s)]
*  where a lot of people do already have some issues [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=108.46s)]
*  with some of their mental health. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=111.36s)]
*  So please, please don't listen to this woman. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=112.56s)]
*  Get outside, get some vitamin D, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  call your family, call your friends. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=116.88s)]
*  You'll never believe it, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  but there are things you can talk about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  outside of the election if you disagree. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  You don't have to agree on anything. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=123.52s)]
*  Talk about, I don't even care what you talk about. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Talk about something else, but do not isolate yourself. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=127.3s)]
*  You know, it's so funny, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=130.32s)]
*  because at my kitchen table, we talk about everything. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=131.16s)]
*  And in our family, Sean has a huge family, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=134.12s)]
*  lots of Democrats, lots of independents, lots of Republicans. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=136.4s)]
*  It's like, if you don't learn how to get along [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  and talk about issues with your family, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=141.5s)]
*  no wonder the country is so divided. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=144.94s)]
*  This is where you learn to have differences of opinion [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=146.78s)]
*  and still love each other, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=149.38s)]
*  and then you can take that out of the macro scale. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=151.02s)]
*  I just, I'm really sad [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=152.82s)]
*  that this woman is giving this advice. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=154.98s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BY8FQ5O9o&t=157.06s)]
