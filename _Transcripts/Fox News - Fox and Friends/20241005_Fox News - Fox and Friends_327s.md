# Tim Walz removed shocking requirement to save babies born alive after abortion
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c)
*  A 2023 Minnesota abortion law called into question during this week's debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Former President Trump said in the last debate that you believe abortion, quote, in the ninth [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=8.8s)]
*  month is absolutely fine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=17.16s)]
*  Is that what you support? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=18.16s)]
*  I'll give you two minutes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=19.16s)]
*  That's not what the bill says. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=20.16s)]
*  But in Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe versus Wade. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=21.16s)]
*  And here are the changes that Tim Waltz himself made to the law. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=27.4s)]
*  The original bill called for doctors to provide life-saving measures to any baby born alive [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  during an abortion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=36.44s)]
*  And yes, it does happen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  But you'll see Waltz strike through at the bottom, calling only for the care of the infant. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=39.92s)]
*  Legal experts say these changes allow for end-of-life, quote, unquote, comfort care, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=47.2s)]
*  the ultimate euphemism, rather than compelling doctors to save these babies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=51.88s)]
*  Founder and director of the Abortion Survivors Network, Melissa Oden, who survived an abortion [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=57.6s)]
*  herself joins us now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=62.96s)]
*  Melissa, what an honor to have you on today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=65.64s)]
*  Nothing speaks more to what we just saw in that debate than just seeing you right here [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=68.68s)]
*  47 years ago. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=73.28s)]
*  You survived an abortion and luckily got care, and you're sitting here with us today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=74.84s)]
*  Tell us what happened in that bill, and specifically what happens to babies that survive abortions [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=81.4s)]
*  in the state of Minnesota versus other states that don't have these brutal laws? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=88.92s)]
*  You're so right, Rachel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=95.56s)]
*  The reality is babies survived abortions before Roe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=96.62s)]
*  Many of us gratefully survived during Roe, and babies are still surviving abortions today [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=99.66s)]
*  post-Roe. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  The reality is even the CDC years ago, Dr. Willard Cates, identified 300 to 400 live [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=106.8s)]
*  births a year after failed abortions and made it clear this isn't anything that they wanted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=113.02s)]
*  to report about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=117.28s)]
*  They said it should be hushed up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=118.28s)]
*  Why would you want to turn yourself in? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=119.96s)]
*  And there would be public clamor. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=122.2s)]
*  And I think this is where we're at, Rachel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=123.9s)]
*  There are states, very few states, that identify and report the number of babies like me who [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=126.1s)]
*  survive abortions, but we had in 10 different states 270 babies who survived abortions. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=131.16s)]
*  And when you look at that Minnesota report from 2021, five babies survived and not a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=137.9s)]
*  single one of them were provided medical care, Rachel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=143.04s)]
*  This is a travesty. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=145.94s)]
*  So they use this word, and it just makes me sick to my stomach. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=147.96s)]
*  It's called comfort care. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=151.0s)]
*  Why don't you explain to our viewers what comfort care means? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=152.44s)]
*  Yeah, I was thinking about that this morning. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=156.92s)]
*  It reminds me so much of when then-Senator Obama was discussing that in the state of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  Illinois. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  My friend, right, Jill Stanek, a nurse, held a baby like me who had survived an abortion. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  And the response to that baby not being provided medical care and the uproar when she brought [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  it out to the public was that they would create a quote-unquote comfort care room. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=177.6s)]
*  No one would want this for their child, their grandchild, anyone they know and love. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  Why are they willing to do this to babies time and time again? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=188.12s)]
*  And why are they hiding the truth from the American public? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=192.24s)]
*  Yeah, these are babies that it's survivable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=194.76s)]
*  They are not getting medical care. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=198.72s)]
*  They're sometimes put in buckets. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=200.36s)]
*  That's what that nurse actually that you're talking about brought to the attention. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=201.72s)]
*  It horrified many, but it turned other people's hearts to stone. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=206.56s)]
*  They just didn't care. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  And you see someone like Tim Walz doing this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  You say that this is very similar to what they do in China and in North Korea, that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=213.32s)]
*  the policies of the Kamala and Walz future administration and even the Biden administration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  are like those countries. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=227.9s)]
*  And again, this is what the American public needs to know. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=228.9s)]
*  I find it fascinating, yet not surprising, that Governor Walz didn't answer the questions [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=231.32s)]
*  the other night about abortion through the ninth month of pregnancy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=236.42s)]
*  Even did some fact checking and shared that this week that that is correct. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=240.48s)]
*  Under Minnesota law, abortion is not restricted throughout any month of pregnancy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=244.76s)]
*  So abortions often discussed, as you know, in the abstract and with slogans choice and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=250.76s)]
*  reproductive care and all these all these euphemisms. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=256.08s)]
*  You're a real life person. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=260.44s)]
*  This week, our former first lady, Melania Trump, has come out and said that she is pro [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=262.78s)]
*  choice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=268.64s)]
*  What is your message to her? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=269.64s)]
*  I would want her to sit down with me and other abortion survivors and our children and even [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  our mothers who have experienced this behind every abortion survivor is a woman who went [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=278.84s)]
*  through this as well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=282.76s)]
*  A family affected abortionist clinic workers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=283.76s)]
*  You know, I would want her to sit down and hear our stories and see if she can somehow [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  reconcile that stance with the reality of our lives. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=291.32s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that way when I saw the debate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=294.84s)]
*  I wish that J.D. Vance had humanized people like you as much in the debate, but he hadn't [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=297.24s)]
*  met you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=303.88s)]
*  And I want him to meet you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=304.88s)]
*  And I want Donald Trump and Melania to meet you, because I think that that's that's the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=305.88s)]
*  only way to humanize is to tell your story and the story of so many others in your survivors [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=310.16s)]
*  network. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=315.2s)]
*  Melissa, thanks for joining us. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=316.2s)]
*  You bring so much light and joy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=317.72s)]
*  And we're so glad that you're alive and you survived that terrible procedure. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=320.06s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=324.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQL8nhTv4c&t=326.04s)]
