# ‘CAN’T REWRITE HISTORY’: Judge slams Hunter pardon
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64)
*  7.01 here in New York City, more fallout this morning over Joe Biden's controversial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=0.0s)]
*  pardoning of his son Hunter as the federal judge in California accuses the president [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=4.4s)]
*  of trying to rewrite history. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=10.8s)]
*  Now in light of the pardon, more accusations are surfacing about the first son's very [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=12.76s)]
*  troubled past. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=17.48s)]
*  All right, Lucas Tomlinson's got the assignment. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=18.48s)]
*  He's at the White House this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Lucas, fill us in. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=21.68s)]
*  Well, good morning, guys. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=22.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=24.32s)]
*  The federal judge overseeing Hunter Biden's tax case took umbrage with President Biden's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=25.32s)]
*  comments saying that these charges against Hunter were politically motivated. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=29.56s)]
*  The judge lashing out saying, quote, the Constitution provides the president with broad authority [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=33.72s)]
*  to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=39.68s)]
*  But nowhere does the Constitution give the president the authority to rewrite history. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=43.8s)]
*  The pardon not only absolves Hunter of his tax and gun cases, but also for any crimes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  or potential crimes committed over an 11-year period. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=53.32s)]
*  The judge also noted this pardon could be seen as, quote, exceeding the scope of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=56.76s)]
*  pardon power. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=62.16s)]
*  It's a good thing you have an attorney on the couch there, guys. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=63.16s)]
*  Biden for months said that he would never pardon his son. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=65.84s)]
*  That line was repeated at the podium here at the White House by his press secretary [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=68.4s)]
*  for months. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=71.52s)]
*  Of course, they also said for months that Biden would not be dropping out of the race. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=72.52s)]
*  Hunter Biden's former landlord says the president's son has been slow to the hip or venmo. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=76.52s)]
*  It might be more appropriate, stiffing him by over 300,000 in rent after Hunter stayed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=81.0s)]
*  in his $4.25 million home in California. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=86.28s)]
*  Sean McGuire, posting to X, quote, What happens to the 300,000 plus in payback rent that Hunter [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=89.72s)]
*  Biden owes my family from 2019 to 2020? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=98.12s)]
*  Is that pardoned now? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=102.36s)]
*  Perhaps that's a good question for the White House press secretary who's traveling with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=104.36s)]
*  President Biden in Africa, guys. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  I think it was yesterday or the day before, KJP said that this particular pardon was not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  vetted through the typical clemency process that happens at the Department of Justice, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  which is just a couple of blocks behind you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=126.56s)]
*  Many eyebrows were raised when the pardon covered this 11-year period. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=127.56s)]
*  That's a large time period, of course. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=131.04s)]
*  It's not just a pardon for a particular crime. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  It's everything over more than a decade, Steve. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  Taking tickets? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=139.96s)]
*  Maybe even something more serious. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=140.96s)]
*  Thanks, Lucas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=144.44s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=145.44s)]
*  So, number one, question of character. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=146.44s)]
*  The kicker, Hunter Biden, who was living free from a Hollywood producer, who decided to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=148.84s)]
*  pay his overdue taxes and let him live with him for free, and I assume pay for his attorney [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=153.36s)]
*  one of the most expensive and respected in Washington. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=162.08s)]
*  Now we find out when he was living on his own, prior to while the president was running [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=165.68s)]
*  for president, knowing his laptop was in the FBI hands, he's living in Venice Beach with [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=169.2s)]
*  Secret Service protection, rent free because he decided to not pay rent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=174.2s)]
*  People's investments are in rental properties, especially in Venice Beach, takes a lot to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  buy a little, and you have that there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=184.16s)]
*  And then when you complain, the Secret Service changed the locks and the landlord's locked [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=187.16s)]
*  out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=191.32s)]
*  That's the character of the person. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=192.32s)]
*  If you are Joe Biden, vice president, and want to be president-elect, and you find out [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=193.62s)]
*  your son is not paying rent. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=199.28s)]
*  Remember when a nanny or a landscaper without papers would hurt a candidate? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  Then you have your crack addicted, hooker addicted son not paying rent, living for free [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=206.96s)]
*  out on the West Coast, doing your international business deals, all of which is on the laptop [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  that you left at a local repair shop. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=217.78s)]
*  Having said all that, the fallout has to be beyond what he ever dreamed, and among the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=220.68s)]
*  people who are his detractors is Gavin Newsom. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=226.04s)]
*  I completely understand the instinct to protect Hunter, but I took the president's word. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  So by definition, I'm disappointed and cannot support the decision. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=234.04s)]
*  Well, this federal judge is not even taking a position of supporting or agreeing with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=238.16s)]
*  the pardon. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  First of all, she says, this is a press release. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  This is not a pardon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=246.68s)]
*  The second thing, they were very upset. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  The court took issue with them admonishing the court and saying that this was some political [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  process. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=254.92s)]
*  They were just like, plead guilty. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=255.92s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=256.91999999999996s)]
*  This was the plea that he gave. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=260.28s)]
*  So why are you saying that there's this mischaracterization of justice when he pled guilty to the charges [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  there? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=268.84s)]
*  And then you're saying that the court will somehow allow a court case to come before [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=269.84s)]
*  them that is not going to get due process. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=273.44s)]
*  So there's multiple factors there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=275.96s)]
*  I also think when it comes to the legacy of Joe Biden, after he signed the crime bill [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=278.12s)]
*  and put so many people behind bars as a result of that, there is no way he escapes the political [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=284.08s)]
*  ramifications. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=290.84s)]
*  But I pardon all these other people that have similar backgrounds as well. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=291.96s)]
*  So is he going to do that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=295.84s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=297.32s)]
*  That would be a massive release of people. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=299.0s)]
*  Well, and you know, message wise, everybody knew he was going to pardon Hunter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=301.6s)]
*  But Democrats rank and file are steamed at the approach he took because what and this [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=307.82s)]
*  is exactly what the judge Mark Scorsese out in California said, you know, I'll get rid [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=313.2s)]
*  of it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  But Hunter was not singled out because he was the president's son, which is what Joe [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  Biden said. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=323.0s)]
*  And Democrats question why Joe Biden would criticize his own Department of Justice rather [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=324.24s)]
*  than just saying, look, I am a father and my son has had problems and he is now on the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=330.2s)]
*  straight and narrow. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=336.32s)]
*  So I am going to grant him a pardon. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=337.32s)]
*  Democrats would have been OK with that, but just the fact that he blew up the Department [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=340.36s)]
*  of Justice, his own Department of Justice and everybody in the Department of Justice, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  who we've seen so far regarding these judges, they say, Mr. President, you're wrong on that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=349.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think to your point, I think people expected a form of clemency. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  But if anything, it would be in the form of a commutation of a sentence. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  The fact of full blown pardon and the 10 year duration smacks of the lack of accountability, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=361.76s)]
*  corruption of this frankly mafia family that has held the country in its grips via the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=368.84s)]
*  administration for so long. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  And it is such an affront to the hundreds of thousands of currently incarcerated people [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  who are eligible for release under President Trump's First Step Act that are still rotting [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  in jail. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=384.32s)]
*  It flies in the face of all of those veterans, which are the rising single most rising population [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=385.32s)]
*  in the incarcerated system. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  What about them? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=392.76s)]
*  They don't have a famous father that can pardon them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=393.76s)]
*  And it flies in the face of those single mothers who are also a rising representation [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=395.8s)]
*  of the incarcerated system, much like the mother of his child that he refuses to acknowledge. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=400.58s)]
*  Everything about this is the elitism, the protection, the enjoyment that this family [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=405.44s)]
*  has that absolves them of any responsibility. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  And every other American has to pay taxes, has to answer to judges, has to answer to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=413.68s)]
*  parents, has to answer to everyone. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=418.24s)]
*  Paying rent? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=419.24s)]
*  Yes, has to pay rent. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=420.24s)]
*  This is such a travesty and it speaks, in my opinion, to the spinelessness of our Commander-in-Chief, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=421.64s)]
*  the total invertebrate that he is. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=426.8s)]
*  Because he could have stood up and said, I want to protect my son, but I want to teach [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=428.64s)]
*  him as a father would about responsibility. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=433.2s)]
*  So I commute his sentence. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=435.97999999999996s)]
*  And even that, by the way, it wouldn't have sit well with me given that everyone else [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=437.08s)]
*  has to enjoy four walls and a cell. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=440.76s)]
*  And now his son will never learn and he will continue taking advantage of the American [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  people. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  By the way, it doesn't protect him from future charges. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=449.32s)]
*  So let's keep investigating. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=450.32s)]
*  Well, he's got over 10 years. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=452.0s)]
*  The Obama bros on the podcast yesterday, Steve, they would have been okay with it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=454.12s)]
*  He said, I don't know what I'm going to do with my son. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=459.32s)]
*  I got to see how this process plays out. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=460.84s)]
*  And he did it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=462.48s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=463.48s)]
*  Democrats would have accepted it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=464.48s)]
*  But the ones that for two years lauded him for not doing what Donald Trump was going [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  to do and holding the integrity of the justice system up in the Department of Justice, those [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=470.24s)]
*  are the ones who look so stupid right now. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=475.6s)]
*  And that's what he says. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=477.32s)]
*  He goes, Biden, he goes, they trashed Biden yesterday for making defenders of him look [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=478.32s)]
*  stupid with the pardon. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=483.44s)]
*  Typical lying politician. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, and the defenders are the people who said, look, Joe Biden has been very clear. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not going to do it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=490.76s)]
*  You're not going to do it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=491.76s)]
*  You're not going to do it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=492.76s)]
*  He did it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=493.76s)]
*  But my question is, do you guys like looking stupid? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=494.76s)]
*  I mean, they don't. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=496.52s)]
*  And that's why they're saying. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=497.52s)]
*  They do. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=498.52s)]
*  They do. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=499.52s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you why. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=500.52s)]
*  They like looking stupid? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=501.52s)]
*  Because they do like looking stupid. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=502.52s)]
*  I'm going to tell you why. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=503.52s)]
*  First, it was his mental decline. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=504.52s)]
*  And it's like, oh, we didn't know. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=505.52s)]
*  He told us everything was fine. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=509.08s)]
*  Everybody in the family told us everything. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=511.08s)]
*  And it says, OK, all right, we're not going to be shunned again. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=512.4s)]
*  We look bad with this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=516.92s)]
*  Then it came to the part. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=517.92s)]
*  Everyone knew that he was going to pardon. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=519.8s)]
*  But we had his back. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  We knew that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=523.72s)]
*  And now you guys are saying on the podcast, well, he's making us look bad. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=524.72s)]
*  No, you guys are making yourself look bad. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=528.72s)]
*  Eventually, you have to have some type of curiosity. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  You got to press the person and you got to look at the track record. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=534.08s)]
*  Joe Biden has always done what's beneficial to himself and to his family. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=537.68s)]
*  He has protected Hunter Biden his entire life. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=541.92s)]
*  They wouldn't even acknowledge the grandchild. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=544.64s)]
*  OK, they wouldn't even acknowledge the grandchild. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=546.8s)]
*  Everyone knows that the most prized possession to a grandfather is their grandchild. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=549.88s)]
*  Not all. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=554.64s)]
*  You're right. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=555.64s)]
*  Not that family. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=556.64s)]
*  So what made you guys think that somehow he was not going to protect his son? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=557.64s)]
*  The guy that cheated Syracuse in the 1980s. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlOZKmS9h64&t=561.7199999999999s)]
