# 'POLITICAL BUFFOONERY': This is a 'campaign killing' response by Harris, Will Cain says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA)
*  Kamala Harris is having to deal with protesters at some of her and if you watch some of these rallies you start to think maybe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=0.0s)]
*  The wheels are starting to come off just based on what she's saying watch this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=5.68s)]
*  We remember [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=10.96s)]
*  Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=13.08s)]
*  With the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as he intended [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=18.8s)]
*  Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=30.32s)]
*  No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=44.64s)]
*  Wow, that's where you see who she really is in that moment. So somebody said Jesus is Lord. Obviously these were pro-life [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=48.92s)]
*  Protesters who were at her rally and her response was [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=56.94s)]
*  You know, Jesus isn't here. You need to go to that other rally where they like Jesus [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=60.26s)]
*  Unbelievable, and by the way you guys this is on the heels of this past week or last week a pro-life [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=65.1s)]
*  Protester who back in 2020 an African American woman who was protesting and she was blocking the entrance, but she had had a traumatic [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=70.74s)]
*  Abortion when she was 15, so she was a pro-lifer [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=78.62s)]
*  She blocked an entrance in in 2020 went while BLM was burning down cities [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=81.28s)]
*  She blocked an entrance and now she's facing three years in jail. She has a child husband [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=86.44s)]
*  pro-lifers definitely know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=92.24s)]
*  Who is on their side and who is going to attack them and and you saw right there and Harris has no idea those very well [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  May have been regular Democrat voters at a Harris rally [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=101.4s)]
*  Michigan has a lot of that was the cross with constant in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=105.84s)]
*  Just like in Michigan in in Wisconsin you have a lot of pro-life Democrats [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=110.88s)]
*  And that's the the needle that they have to thread and she obviously is not prepared to do that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=115.6s)]
*  We can't think of a Democratic candidate. I don't think in our history [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=121.0s)]
*  Barack Obama or Joe Biden included no Democrat would respond in that moment the way that she responded [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=126.64s)]
*  You have to understand the gravity of that response. I don't know what she saw [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=134.4s)]
*  I don't see the camera from the other angle. I don't know what she internalized. I don't know what she heard [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=140.14s)]
*  I don't know if she heard Jesus is Lord, but that's what was said and for you to respond you're at the wrong rally [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't care if all she thought was they were pro-life to your point Charlie [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=152.82s)]
*  That is in our past in the history of America a campaign killing response [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=156.54s)]
*  Now whether even if she doesn't mean it that is political [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=163.26s)]
*  Buffoonery [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  No one would tell that constituency [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=169.18s)]
*  Yelling in the name of Jesus you're at the wrong rally the deal the election would be over [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  Over and it should be over this morning. That is a killer. I [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=180.62s)]
*  Absolutely love the transparency of it though in that moment. She that was one of her most authentic moments. Honestly, that's who she is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=186.18s)]
*  She is that person that you just saw there by the way, this yelling thing is becoming a pattern [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=193.66s)]
*  So she was at Grand Rapids at a rally there and here's what happened [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=198.66s)]
*  We should terminate the Constitution of the United States [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=205.94s)]
*  Should never again have the privilege of standing behind the seal of the president of the United States [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=210.82s)]
*  Again [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=224.66s)]
*  Don't mean to keep making every single clip like the deepest insight into everyone psyche, but once again, I want to say this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=229.78s)]
*  We really as a people need to begin to understand the psychological tactic of projection. This is everything [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=236.22s)]
*  This is projection. Okay. This is a party who's been in power who's undermined the United States Constitution and for that matter [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  Openly showed tension and aggression towards United States Constitution to project anger at this moment [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=250.38s)]
*  Like it never again about the constant please the Constitution is under threat from one particular ideology [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=255.18s)]
*  100% by the way Harris was asked how her campaign went from from joy to what you just saw [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=261.66s)]
*  What happened? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=268.1s)]
*  watch [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=269.7s)]
*  Critics who say the joy is gone you respond. Oh [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=271.54s)]
*  I'm having a great time [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=274.98s)]
*  Yeah, wasn't that so joyful that the earlier clip we just saw her screaming everybody listen obviously [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=277.54s)]
*  This is about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  Being frustrated that everything they tried [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=286.3s)]
*  is not working that they thought they could sleepwalk through this and sort of manipulate their way to the to the finish line and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=289.66s)]
*  Donald Trump is picking up steam at exactly the wrong time because it's really hard to turn that back right now [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=297.82s)]
*  And when she goes on that tirade she's pointing to the vice president's seal on the front of her podium and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=303.94s)]
*  There's something extra authoritarian about that. Yeah, he never again will he stand behind the seal [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  It's like whoa lady. Yeah. Well, we started the conversation [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=317.02s)]
*  So you're trying to win mail votes to like that also doesn't help. I'm Steve juicy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuenBfv82oA&t=321.53999999999996s)]
