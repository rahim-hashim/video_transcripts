# GWU reveals why college faculty are refusing to ‘take action’ against anti-Israel protests
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA)
*  The anti-Israel protests on college campuses showing no signs of stopping anytime soon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=0.0s)]
*  We have been out here for 57 hours. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=7.0s)]
*  And we are not going anywhere. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=17.5s)]
*  George Washington University suspending at least seven student protestors who organized an anti-Israel encampment on campus and refused to leave after demonstrations stretched into a third day. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=20.5s)]
*  Our next guest escaped religious persecution as a Christian in China at 12 years old and is now standing up for his threatened Jewish classmates at GWU. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=36.0s)]
*  Richard Lee joins us now along with his classmate Sabrina Sauffer. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=47.0s)]
*  Thank you both so much for being here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=51.0s)]
*  Richard, let me start with you. You've seen this type of stuff before. Persecution. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=53.0s)]
*  Does this look like the type of persecution that say maybe Christians, other religious groups have faced elsewhere in the world? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=58.0s)]
*  Oh, 100 percent. First of all, thank you so much for having me on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=65.0s)]
*  Well, I've personally escaped from China when I was 12. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=70.5s)]
*  And to be exact, oppression always starts with hatred. And hatred always, time and time again, a lot of times in history, started with anti-Semitism. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=73.5s)]
*  And that is what we're seeing on our college campus right now, right in front of our doorsteps. And it's very, very sad. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=85.5s)]
*  No doubt. You said you can't go a minute without hearing a chant or being confronted with this kind of stuff. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=91.5s)]
*  Sabrina, this hits home for you. You're Jewish. Have you felt threatened directly or indirectly? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=97.0s)]
*  I mean, what kind of environment is George Washington University allowing? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah, so again, thank you for having me. And I personally, I think this has been going on for way too long. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=108.0s)]
*  This has been 20 years in the making. I've been threatened not even now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=114.0s)]
*  I mean, two years back, I've been threatened by these same sorts of students. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=119.0s)]
*  And at first, I didn't feel safe. I really didn't. I remember one night I was, I mean, I was like shaking in my bed at midnight [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=123.5s)]
*  because I heard that there were some students who were after me and I was really afraid with what to do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=131.5s)]
*  But now I've gained a lot of courage. I've stood up for my classmates. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=137.5s)]
*  But I think that more of the issue stems from now we have a lot of support in America. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=140.5s)]
*  But 10, 20 years from now, what if these students are the ones in our halls of Congress and our policymakers, leaders of businesses? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=145.0s)]
*  This is really my concern for the future because I don't know if this country, I mean, I'm Jewish, I'm Israeli. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=154.0s)]
*  Will this country be safe for my children? And it's not only a Jewish problem, it is an American problem [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=160.0s)]
*  because these people are not only chanting against the Jews, they're chanting against American values. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=167.0s)]
*  And it really stems from the faculty. That is the root of this problem. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=172.5s)]
*  They are indoctrinating kids with anti-Israel lies and hate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=175.5s)]
*  And this is where the problem starts and it has to end with that problem too. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=180.5s)]
*  Absolutely. Richard, do you feel, why won't school leadership do anything? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=184.5s)]
*  It's one thing to have a political point of view. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=189.5s)]
*  It's a whole other thing to have students feel directly, physically threatened by the rhetoric and actions of their fellow students. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=191.5s)]
*  Why can't, why don't these leaders have any courage? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=197.5s)]
*  Well, I think it's primarily because our education system has been infiltrated by, well, by a lot of Marxists and socialists for the last 10 years [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=201.0s)]
*  and maybe for even longer. And now that you're seeing a generation of Americans indoctrinated [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=211.0s)]
*  and now they're basically closeted communists and outright anti-Semites. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=217.0s)]
*  And the schools, of course, they haven't done anything about it because a lot of the instructors now, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=224.0s)]
*  they are themselves in these anti-Semitic protests. They're participating. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=230.0s)]
*  And I do have to say, I do have to commend the school's leadership in terms of, well, requesting the Metropolitan PD, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=234.5s)]
*  the Washington DC's police department to basically, to try to clear out these anti-Semitic protests. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=243.5s)]
*  That hasn't just been harassment, but have also been, they've just been blatantly spreading hate speech. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=251.5s)]
*  And unfortunately, the MPD under the leadership of Mayor Bowser has refused. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=258.5s)]
*  Interesting. Sabrina, you mentioned there's a institute on GW's campus called the Elliott School Institute of Middle Eastern Studies. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=264.0s)]
*  My guess is a lot of its funding comes from somewhere else and it pushes an ideology too. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=273.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. I mean, this is another part of the problem why the universities often don't really take the right steps [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=279.0s)]
*  because they've, I mean, one stat is that they've received $3.7 billion. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=286.0s)]
*  I mean, this is across American campuses and just GW, $3.7 billion from the UAE Saudi Arabian Qatar from 2014 to 2019. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=291.0s)]
*  So it explains a lot of the reason why universities aren't really taking proper action. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=301.0s)]
*  And the fact that we have entire academic departments that were devoted to one ideology in this particular institute at George Washington [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=306.0s)]
*  is very anti-Israel. And there have been conferences where they're saying we're producing knowledge, we're decolonizing knowledge, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=314.0s)]
*  and we're doing it quietly in the classroom to retake our power. This is really very, I mean, it's insidious. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=321.0s)]
*  And I think that the fact that it's being done in the classroom is most threatening because it's not allowing the outside world to see it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=329.0s)]
*  And I think that it's important that students share their voices in terms of what's going on in their classrooms now in terms of that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=335.0s)]
*  You're exactly right. I mean, decolonizing knowledge is code for tearing down everything Western, everything Israeli, everything American. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=341.0s)]
*  It's a direct affront and assault. Richard, thank you for your courage and for your insight. You're willing to stand up on this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=349.0s)]
*  And Sabrina, likewise, thank you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=354.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. Great to see you both. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RklbHH81nA&t=356.0s)]
