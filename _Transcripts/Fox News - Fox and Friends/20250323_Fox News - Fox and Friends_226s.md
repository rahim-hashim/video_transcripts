**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8)
*  ICE announcing the first arrest of an illegal migrant gang member using the Alien Enemies Act [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=0.0s)]
*  as a federal judge tries blocking the White House from deporting violent illegal migrant gang members out. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=5.76s)]
*  I'm proud to say in the past 48 hours ICE along with our local partners and our other fellow [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=12.64s)]
*  federal agencies have arrested more than 68 TDA gang members terrorists [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  in the United States. To date we've arrested 394 of these terrorists. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  Our goal is to eradicate TDA from U.S. soil. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=33.28s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about Trent A. Aragwa. John Fabricatore is the former ICE field office director in Denver, Colorado. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=38.0s)]
*  The state known as the Gang's Control Center and he joins us now. John great to see you on this Sunday morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  Take us through what does the Alien Enemies Act mean for law enforcement? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=51.36s)]
*  Well it's a great tool for the president to use to help eradicate foreign terrorist organizations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=58.16s)]
*  off the soil of the United States and this last four years the Biden administration has led in all [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=63.28s)]
*  these foreign terrorists criminal terrorist organizations and and now this tool is a is a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=68.56s)]
*  good way for us to be able to remove them from U.S. soil. And what does it mean? I mean you're [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=74.16s)]
*  a former ICE guy what does it mean? I mean our Customs and Border Patrol ICE they've they've not [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=79.6s)]
*  no one's had their backs for the past four years so what does it mean now for them to be able to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  have these tools at their disposal and just to be able to do their jobs? Yeah the morale is definitely [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  better knowing that this administration has their back that they're going to actually be able to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=94.64s)]
*  enforce the immigration law that what they're doing every day means something with the last [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  administration and we were just letting people across the border that the men and women of ICE [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=103.6s)]
*  knew that that their daily job what they were doing didn't mean what it should have meant that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=108.4s)]
*  they were not enforcing the law. The Alien Enemies Act is allowing us to do that and it's a top [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  priority for the Trump administration. I guess why are some people then standing in the way? I mean [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=117.84s)]
*  you would think we would want to deport these gang members you think we want to deport these people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=124.4s)]
*  who you label as terrorists who our president has labeled as terrorists so why why still stand in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=129.52s)]
*  the way? It's incredible to think about when you think about the types of people that ICE is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=134.24s)]
*  arresting right now they're murderers, human traffickers, sex traffickers, you know these [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  are people we don't want on US soil and they're they came in illegally and the president's trying [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  to use a method to get them out of the country faster to secure America and and to me the people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  that are standing in this way are doing it because they want open borders. Well John real quick what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=155.52s)]
*  went through your head I'm sure you saw that interview with JD Vance and ABC's Martha Raddatz [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=161.04s)]

*  no big deal. You know Lisa we still have people today that are saying that TDA did not take over [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  that apartment complex and other apartment complexes in Colorado. They most absolutely did [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=182.88s)]
*  you're seeing it on video that shot that Fox is showing right now and it's just it's just incredible [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkwWB126N8&t=188.24s)]
