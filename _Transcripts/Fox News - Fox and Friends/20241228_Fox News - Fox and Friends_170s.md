# Newly surfaced photos show VP Biden posing with Hunter's business associates
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY)
*  This is in the New York Post. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes from America First Legal. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=1.36s)]
*  This is Joe Biden posing with some of Hunter Biden's, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=2.96s)]
*  well, first of all, this is an introduction to Xi Jinping. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=8.4s)]
*  And then there was a photo with what [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=11.56s)]
*  appears to be some of Hunter's business associates as well [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=14.6s)]
*  that includes Joe Biden. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=17.64s)]
*  Now, of course, Biden has said many times, I'd never, no, no, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=19.28s)]
*  didn't meet Hunter's buddies. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=24.28s)]
*  Remember? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  I did not know he was on the board of that company. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=26.48s)]
*  I've never discussed my business or their business, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=32.6s)]
*  my sons or daughters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=35.64s)]
*  I never discussed a single thing with my son [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=36.76s)]
*  about anything having to do with Ukraine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=40.6s)]
*  I have never discussed with my son or my brother [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=43.2s)]
*  or anyone else anything having to do with their businesses, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=47.16s)]
*  period. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  A little bit of a surprise. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=53.28s)]
*  What do you got there, Charlie? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  A great haul of China. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=55.72s)]
*  It's such a great headline. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=57.6s)]
*  Marvelous. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  It's marvelous. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=60.4s)]
*  And it is. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=61.32s)]
*  And you know, it's kind of interesting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=61.8s)]
*  All of these pictures were in the National Archives. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=63.76s)]
*  And of course, the National Archives [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  are the exact same people that then-former President Trump [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=68.72s)]
*  got into that tiff with that resulted in Mar-a-Lago being [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=73.6s)]
*  raided by the FBI. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=78.36s)]
*  So it really does sort of, and this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=81.6s)]
*  is evidence that what we're talking about here [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=83.8s)]
*  is an actual government cover-up by the government [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=86.32s)]
*  trying to protect these pictures from getting out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=91.0s)]
*  Stephen Miller, who's incoming White House Deputy Chief [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=94.44s)]
*  of Staff for Policy, says it's unacceptable. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=97.0s)]
*  He spoke, I think, last night on Hannity. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  How often in life do you get photographic documentary [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=103.96s)]
*  evidence that proves that the president, in this case, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=108.44s)]
*  Joe Biden lied, that proves a government conspiracy, that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=112.44s)]
*  proves a media conspiracy? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=116.28s)]
*  We have the actual photographs proving [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  that Joe Biden met with Hunter's business partners, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=121.24s)]
*  met with high-ranking officials in China with Hunter Biden [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=124.28s)]
*  for no legitimate government purpose whatsoever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=127.8s)]
*  And there was a massive effort to keep these photos [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=131.52s)]
*  from the American people before the election. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=134.92s)]
*  How much evidence is stacked up of the ways [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=138.28s)]
*  the permanent bureaucracy in Washington [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=140.8s)]
*  has tried to keep President Trump from returning [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=143.28s)]
*  to the Oval Office, and yet he won, yet he won a landslide, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  and yet he will return because the American people are sick [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=150.28s)]
*  of a government, as you say, that has forgotten them? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  And I will go further, a government [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=156.36s)]
*  that has betrayed them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=158.08s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=160.12s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=161.0s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7UIgxB8CY&t=161.92000000000002s)]
