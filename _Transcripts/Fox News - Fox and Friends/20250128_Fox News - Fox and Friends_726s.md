# Trump signs executive order banning transgender service members
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4)
*  President Trump keeps his promise to get wokeness out of the United States Armed Forces as he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=0.0s)]
*  signs multiple executive orders to reshape the military. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=7.22s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey has all the details. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=10.44s)]
*  Hey Peter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=13.16s)]
*  Good morning and standing here it feels like it's been more than a week and a day since [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=14.16s)]
*  President Trump was sworn in because so far, and we've got a graphic here, he signed 38 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=17.68s)]
*  executive orders and he signed them in the Oval Office and at an arena and at his resort [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=24.44s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=29.8s)]
*  The latest ones came last night and what they do is reinstate troops who refused the COVID [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=30.8s)]
*  vaccine about 8000 people, develops an American Iron Dome missile defense system like what [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=36.36s)]
*  they have in Israel, formulate a new policy on transgender troops that is up to Pete [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=42.28s)]
*  Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, to figure out how that's going to work and then ban [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=47.32s)]
*  DEI initiatives in the military. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=51.8s)]
*  I'll be signing four new executive orders. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=56.4s)]
*  First is that I'm directing our new Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, he's what we need, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  to immediately begin the construction of a state of the art Iron Dome missile defense [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=64.44s)]
*  shield which will be able to protect Americans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=68.64s)]
*  You see that with Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=71.92s)]
*  We're out of 319 rockets, they knocked down just about every one of them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=72.92s)]
*  So I think the United States is entitled to that and everything will be made right here [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=78.64s)]
*  in the USA, 100%. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=82.36s)]
*  When the Trump cabinet is growing, his Treasury Secretary was easily confirmed last night. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=85.0s)]
*  Scott Besson got 68 votes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=89.64s)]
*  Sean Duffy for transportation is expected to get bipartisan support as well later on [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=91.92s)]
*  today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=96.8s)]
*  Nothing public on President Trump's schedule that we have seen but he is planning to send [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=97.8s)]
*  his press secretary, Caroline Levitt, out to the briefing room for her first appearance [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=101.48s)]
*  there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=105.72s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=106.72s)]
*  It'll be historic. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=107.72s)]
*  Hey Peter, going back to when you were talking about how Donald Trump revoked the Biden [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=109.08s)]
*  policy allowing trans people to serve in the armed forces. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=114.52s)]
*  The number of trans people in the armed services right now, I know there was an NIH study or [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=118.56s)]
*  estimate done like five years ago at 8,000. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=124.8s)]
*  Who knows how many there are today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  What's going to happen to those people? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=132.92s)]
*  It sounds like once Pete Hegseth comes up with the new policy, they are going to be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=135.4s)]
*  discharged and it's not essentially what the argument is in the fact sheet that we were [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  given about that executive order. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=144.84s)]
*  President Trump does not think that transgender people are physically or mentally stable enough [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=147.0s)]
*  to serve in the armed forces and they specifically cite readiness with transition surgeries. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  If you have a transition surgery, the recovery time and the narcotics that you have to be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=158.32s)]
*  as part of the process could affect your readiness for up to 12 months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=165.64s)]
*  They say that is what their concern is. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=170.52s)]
*  So if there is a readiness concern, you're basically booted from the military. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=173.04s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=178.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=179.76s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=180.76s)]
*  So I guess we're waiting for Pete to get the job, but they've certainly gotten woken us [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=181.76s)]
*  out of the military. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=185.84s)]
*  DEI is going to be history. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=186.84s)]
*  They got to enforce it and goodbye DEI along Veterans Affairs to 60 DEI employees over [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=188.28s)]
*  at Veterans Affairs with salaries totaling more than $8 million. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=193.68s)]
*  We're told they're done. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=198.48s)]
*  There's no need. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=199.96s)]
*  If you talk about cutting, they're cutting DEI programs everywhere, but especially in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=200.96s)]
*  the military. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  And I thought Pete said something interesting on the steps yesterday. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to enforce it to make sure you're not going around me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=209.76s)]
*  But when it comes to the Tuskegee Airmen, they thought that that was a little that was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=212.72s)]
*  passive aggressive. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=217.4s)]
*  We're going to cut that off because that's DEI. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=218.4s)]
*  No it isn't. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=221.4s)]
*  It's a fantastic military story about the first black fighter pilot. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=222.4s)]
*  It was intentionally cut to try to cut the knees out of this administration. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  Make it seem racially intolerant. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  And to make Pete seem like a racist, make the president. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  The whole point of the Tuskegee Airmen is their merit and acknowledging their merit. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=240.56s)]
*  I'm just glad that we finally got a Pentagon that is worried about metrics. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  And the metrics have to be, can you do the old course? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=250.36s)]
*  Can you do the job? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  Are you lethal enough? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Can you go after the enemy? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=255.8s)]
*  Do you have the mental capacity to decipher the enemy versus friend? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=256.98s)]
*  That's all I want. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=262.64s)]
*  I don't care about getting women in. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=263.64s)]
*  I don't care about getting diversity numbers in. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=265.44s)]
*  I want to be feared by the world. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=267.7s)]
*  And finally, we have people in there that's willing to do that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=270.48s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=273.0s)]
*  He also signed an executive order saying if you lost your military career, and 8,000 people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=274.0s)]
*  did because they refused to have the vaccine, then you could be reinstated with back pay. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=279.48s)]
*  So we interviewed Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Haig. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=285.72s)]
*  He has served our country in the Army. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=288.12s)]
*  He was two years away from retirement. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  And he said he resigned from the military when they were forcing him to do this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=293.18s)]
*  He didn't want to say, I'm going to claim an exemption, like a religious exemption, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=296.8s)]
*  because he said that wasn't true. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=300.8s)]
*  So because they were kicking him out, he just said he resigned. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=302.92s)]
*  So he's not sure he's eligible for the reinstatement. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  But this is what he said about Donald Trump and what he went through. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=308.44s)]
*  I think me, like many others, were ecstatic about it, at the idea of the potential to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=312.36s)]
*  rejoin the service. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=319.0s)]
*  You know, I spent 18 years on active duty service. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=320.0s)]
*  It was my career, my entire adulthood. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=323.72s)]
*  And I lost that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  And now there's the potential to regain it now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=330.04s)]
*  Very appreciative. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=332.44s)]
*  I'm thankful that President Trump made these promises early on and is now following through [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=335.08s)]
*  with them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=341.23999999999995s)]
*  So I didn't want to get the vaccine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  I made it clear early on in my, you know, before the mandate, actually, to my leadership [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=344.11999999999995s)]
*  that I was not planning to get it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=349.11999999999995s)]
*  Once it was mandated, I didn't. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=352.44s)]
*  I told him I wasn't going to. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=354.32s)]
*  And I submitted my resignation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=356.2s)]
*  Me personally, I love the idea of going back to the service. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=358.08s)]
*  That's just what I'm passionate about. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=361.48s)]
*  He was an officer. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=363.68s)]
*  Let me just say one thing, if that's OK. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=364.68s)]
*  This is what he did for our country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=366.92s)]
*  Officer in the Army, completed Airborne School, Ranger School, served as an infantry officer, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=368.64s)]
*  communications officer, two deployments to Iraq, one in Kuwait, and then rejoined as [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=372.8s)]
*  a drilling reservist when that mandate was finally dropped. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=376.72s)]
*  So I hope he is eligible. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=380.24s)]
*  I hope they do case by case basis. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=381.72s)]
*  If you retired or you resigned because of that mandate, then hopefully you can go back [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=384.04s)]
*  and serve and get that back pay. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=388.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=389.84s)]
*  I'd like to add this before we move on from defense. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=390.88s)]
*  The president brought it up in every speech and no one ever reported it because they were [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=392.88s)]

*  But he says, I'm going to sign an executive order to start building the Iron Dome for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=399.76s)]
*  this country, missile defense, that to keep up with the next hypersonics and everything, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=404.67999999999995s)]
*  to make sure it's not outdated, is going to need constant improvement. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=408.28s)]
*  But he said, I watched what was happening with Israel. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=411.64s)]
*  I saw them knock down all those missiles with coming from Iran. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=413.88s)]
*  I've seen it happen regularly. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=417.0s)]
*  What's happening in Ukraine? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  Why don't we have it in our country? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=419.96s)]
*  So it's going to cost something like $250 billion. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=421.76s)]
*  Congress has got to green light it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=424.12s)]
*  But he wants work to start right away. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=425.52s)]
*  Who in this country would not want missile defense, especially with ICBMs being shot [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=427.4s)]
*  by North Korea? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  How does it make sense that we don't have a shield? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=433.76s)]
*  Rumsfeld talked about it and they said, you're crazy. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=436.32s)]
*  The technology is not there. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  He was not crazy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=440.12s)]
*  He was right with the concept. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  But I think we're there. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=443.0s)]
*  I like to say, I don't know how you got a country this big, but I'm sure there's some [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=444.0s)]
*  scientists that we could focus on putting them in the area. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=448.04s)]
*  Combination of that idea as well as we got to get with these drones. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=450.32s)]
*  I mean, we got to figure out how they're able to fly, who they are. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=454.8s)]
*  I want technology. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=460.04s)]
*  I want R&I into that as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=461.44s)]
*  So President Trump's signing four new military focused executive orders, including one that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=465.96s)]
*  calls to remove DEI in the military and another banning transgender service members. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=471.0s)]
*  And in a little while, I'll be signing four new executive orders. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=478.68s)]
*  First is that I'm directing our new Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, who's going to be [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=482.36s)]
*  great by the way. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=486.76s)]
*  We will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=488.24s)]
*  It's going to be gone. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=492.64s)]
*  In addition, we will stop our service members from being indoctrinated with radical left [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=493.64s)]
*  ideologies such as critical race theory. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=498.6s)]
*  So Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sergeant David Bellavia joins us now. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=501.16s)]
*  Thanks for getting up this morning, David. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=506.8s)]
*  Thank you. Appreciate you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=510.32s)]
*  So obviously we're excited to have Pete Hegseth at the Secretary of Defense. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=511.8s)]
*  Secretary, what do you make of these new changes getting rid of the focus on the mission plan, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=515.84s)]
*  which is to defeat the enemy? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=523.04s)]
*  Lawrence, if you know, the cliche is war is hell. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=525.04s)]
*  I can't even I can't even tell you how devastating Joe Biden and Democrats have been to the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=529.08s)]
*  DOD knowingly gutting our ethos, who we are, making us try to think about whether or not [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  we're the bad guy or the good guy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=543.08s)]
*  We know we talked about this transgender ban. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  This isn't a transgender ban. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=548.6s)]
*  This is clearly stating that if you cannot deploy and fight, then we don't want you in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=550.46s)]
*  the military, which is the equivalent of saying to our pilots, if you can't see, we don't [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=557.16s)]
*  want you behind the yoke of an F-16 Charlie. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=562.36s)]
*  We don't want you on an F-22. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=566.3599999999999s)]
*  Transgender soldiers right now, whether you're on hormones or you're non-deployable for 36 [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=568.56s)]
*  months after a transition surgery. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=575.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, who are you fighting for? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=579.12s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=581.12s)]
*  Are you there for you or are you there for your country and your teammates? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=582.12s)]
*  This is all about taking the selfishness out of serving your country and reminding people [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=586.3599999999999s)]
*  it's all about the community. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=591.52s)]
*  It's all about the team. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  It's all about the country. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=594.24s)]
*  And I'm ashamed that it took executive orders to remind the greatest military in the world [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=595.24s)]
*  who we are and what we do. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=600.88s)]
*  It's so incredible. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=602.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, you just laid it out perfectly about what the standards should be. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  And it should be no different based on what box you check. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  Here's Secretary Hexeth is going to take some getting used to laying out the major plan. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=612.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=617.24s)]
*  Today, there are more executive orders coming that we fully support on removing [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=618.24s)]
*  DEI inside the Pentagon. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=624.2s)]
*  Our job is lethality and readiness and war fighting. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=627.1600000000001s)]
*  We're going to hold people accountable. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=631.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, he wrote a book about it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=634.44s)]
*  Expect major changes. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=636.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, really that book is the bedrock of what I mean, if you want to know where [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  the 29th Secretary of Defense stands, it's all in black and white. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=644.48s)]
*  The key, again, is that the Chinese, the Russians, Iran, ISIS, Al Qaeda. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=649.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=655.16s)]
*  When we go to the battlefield, none of these things about a kinder, gentler world, we all [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=656.16s)]
*  want peace. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=662.24s)]
*  No one wants war. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=663.36s)]
*  But we will be ready to wipe you off the face of the planet if you want to hurt our citizens [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  or our allies and our friends. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=670.78s)]
*  That's the entire subject matter. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  When I was in school, Lawrence, like you, what was the main line of the paragraph? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=675.8s)]
*  This is what we do in the military. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=680.68s)]
*  We will break you and we will force you to change your opinion. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=682.72s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=687.36s)]
*  And we can't do it by making ourselves feel good about who we want to be. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=688.92s)]
*  No more of this Petri dish mentality. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=693.64s)]
*  We are a warrior class and we have to be that to keep America safe. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  I love the war energy. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=700.48s)]
*  All the door kickers that I've been speaking with, men like you, they all have this reignited [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=702.2s)]
*  energy and that started with the commander in chief Donald Trump and Pete Hexeth leading [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=707.5200000000001s)]
*  the way. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=711.6400000000001s)]
*  Sergeant, thanks so much for joining the program this morning. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SdsPBG9X4&t=712.6400000000001s)]
