# Assad flees Syria, arrives in Moscow after being granted asylum
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA)
*  Fox News alert. Listen to this. The U.S. striking dozens of ISIS targets in Syria. I have up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=0.0s)]
*  to 75 as Islamic forces seize control of the area, including potentially what's left of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=6.44s)]
*  the chemical weapons. Now, the rebels said we don't want the chemical weapons, which [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=12.44s)]
*  is good news. For the first time in more than 50 years, Assad's regime, minority run, no [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=15.36s)]
*  longer in power. The ousted dictator arriving in Russia, where he's been granted asylum, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  according to the Kremlin. As president elect Trump calls on Russia to take the opportunity [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=26.96s)]
*  and end the war in Ukraine. GOP Senator Tom Cotton sits on the Armed Services Committee. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  He's one of the few that fully understands what's happening in this region. Senator, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=36.64s)]
*  what should America's role be right now? Well, Brian, first off, it's very welcome news for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  the Syrian people. As you said, they've suffered under the Assad dictatorship for more than [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  50 years. It's also humiliating news for our adversaries, Russia and Iran, which have been [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=53.16s)]
*  propping up Assad for a decade or for over a decade. Russia has two major bases there in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=59.08s)]
*  Syria that they've used to help support the Houthi rebels in Yemen that have been attacking our [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=64.8s)]
*  sailors in the Red Sea. But we also have to be guarded about the future as well. I don't think [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=69.64s)]
*  we should expect democracy is naturally going to flower in Syria. We have to protect our interest, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=75.2s)]
*  as Israel does as well. That's why the United States and Israel carried out those airstrikes [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=80.56s)]
*  over the weekend to make sure, for instance, that ISIS remnants in eastern Syria weren't taking the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  advantage of this period to gain more land or that those chemical weapons or other weapons depots [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=89.6s)]
*  you mentioned weren't falling into the wrong hands. So we want to work with our partners like Israel [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=96.6s)]
*  and Turkey and the region to try to help Syria have a stable and government that's going to have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=101.28s)]
*  peaceful relations with its neighbors and with the United States. But I think we have to be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=106.32s)]
*  clear-eyed. Ronald Reagan used to say about Soviet Russia, trust but verify. I think in this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=110.96s)]
*  situation we need to distrust and verify anyone who might come to power in Syria. So the president, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=115.88s)]
*  just to paraphrase, came out, president-elect Trump said, we should have nothing to do with this, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=121.72s)]
*  not our fight. We should have nothing to do with it. I really believe our main interest, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=125.52s)]
*  America's main interest, is to get the Russians out of Syria. Their military base, their warm war [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=130.4s)]
*  report, it's allowing to be ferry weapons to Iran and to get weapons from Iran and to arm the Houthi [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=136.8s)]
*  rebels who are rocketing us in the Red Sea and rocketing Israel on a regular basis. Do you see [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=143.28s)]
*  it that way? Yeah, Brian, anything like this rebellion that diminishes Russian and Iranian [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  influence and power in the Middle East is good for the United States, it's good for Israel, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=156.0s)]
*  it's good for our Arab friends. As you say, those bases that Russia uses in Syria are waystations [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=160.08s)]
*  for weapons going into Yemen that are used to attack American naval ships and the freedom of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=166.48s)]
*  commerce in the Red Sea. Syria has been used for a very long time as a transit point for fighters [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=172.56s)]
*  and for weapons going from Iran into Lebanon, for Hezbollah, to attack Israel. So anything that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=179.12s)]
*  stops those things from happening is a good development for the United States, a good [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=185.44s)]
*  development for Israel. We just have to be guarded and careful about what may follow Assad. It's not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=189.6s)]
*  necessarily going to be that much better. It could be, but it may not be. It will be Sunni and there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=194.56s)]
*  will be enemies to Iran. That's pretty clear, which will be helpful. Here's what Donald Trump [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=199.84s)]
*  said yesterday when asked about the future of NATO and America. Do you commit that the United States [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  will remain a member of NATO while you're in office? Again, they have to pay their bills. If [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=211.28s)]
*  they pay their bills, absolutely. But not if they don't pay their bills. But NATO's taking advantage [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=216.48s)]
*  of us. If they're paying their bills and if I think they're treating us fairly, the answer is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=220.4s)]
*  absolutely, I'd stay with NATO. But if not, you would consider the possibility of getting it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=225.36s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah, absolutely. Your thoughts? This is exactly what he said in his first term, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=230.08s)]
*  Brian. He forced NATO members to start actually investing in our common defense, something that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=238.48s)]
*  the United States and just a handful of other nations do. All NATO nations are supposed to spend [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=243.28s)]
*  2% of their economy on their military. There's still many that don't, including many of the large [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  wealthy nations in Western Europe. It's time they start investing in their military for our shared [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  common defense. Lastly, real quick, Pete Hegseth seems to have gotten momentum behind him, but [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=258.24s)]
*  you're in Washington. You talk to these senators. You go to lunch in the cafeteria together. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=263.76s)]
*  So is he on track? Is he gaining momentum? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=268.8s)]
*  Brian, I expect a Republican Senate is going to confirm all of a Republican president-elect's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=274.4s)]
*  nominees. I had a good meeting last week with Pete Hegseth and with Pam Bondi. I know many of these [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=279.28s)]
*  nominees, two Arkansans have been nominated as ambassadors, Marco Rubio, Kelly Loeffler, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=283.92s)]
*  Doug Collins, and I served together. In fact, if you go back 32 years to Bill Clinton's transition, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=288.96s)]
*  there are only two nominees out of 72 cabinet secretary nominees in which senators of the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=294.32s)]
*  president-elect's party voted against him. So no one should be surprised that a Republican Senate [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=299.84s)]
*  is going to confirm the Republican president-elect's cabinet secretaries. All right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=305.44s)]
*  And don't be surprised if your new book, Seven Things You Can't Say About China, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  becomes a bestseller like your others. It's coming out shortly. You can pre-order it now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=315.04s)]
*  Thanks so much, Senator. I know how you had time to write it, but pretty impressive. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=319.44s)]
*  Thanks so much. I'll talk to you soon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpYGuTRfoyA&t=322.88s)]
