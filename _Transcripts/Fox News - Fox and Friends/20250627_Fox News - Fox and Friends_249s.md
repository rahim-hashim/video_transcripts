# Trump announces China trade deal as stocks soar, summer gas prices hit 4-year low
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA)
*  We just signed with China yesterday, right? Just signed with China. We're having some [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=0.0s)]
*  great deals. We have one coming up, maybe with India, very big one. We're going to open [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=6.12s)]
*  up India. In the China deal, we're starting to open up China. Things that never really [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  could have happened in the relationship with every country has been very good. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=16.82s)]
*  It's great news. The United States and China agreeing on a framework that could lead to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=20.8s)]
*  a trade deal after restarting talks in Geneva last month. This, as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=24.92s)]
*  approach record highs and summer gas prices hitting a four-year low. Co-host of The Big [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  Money Show, Brian Brimberg joins us now. Brian, this is good news. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=37.92s)]
*  It's so nice to be with you on a Friday and have good news. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  Happy Friday. We are right on the precipice of stocks hitting [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=45.2s)]
*  all-time highs. Think about that. I mean, go back to April and think about all the panic, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=49.5s)]
*  all the financial press telling you how bad things could be, what terrorists were going [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=54.3s)]
*  to do. If you listen to them and you sold stocks, then you've missed out on one of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=59.12s)]
*  the greatest rallies we've ever seen. You've got an economy right now with low inflation, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=64.34s)]
*  pretty strong job numbers. You've got tax cuts on the way. You've got trade deals happening. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=71.7s)]
*  This is one of those moments where the growth engine of America is really starting to rev. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=77.56s)]
*  It's pretty exciting, by the way, to see companies getting in on that because they [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=83.94s)]
*  love what this tax bill might do in terms of creating new breaks for building factories [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=89.06s)]
*  and investing in equipment and R&D. They're relocating here. It is a really exciting moment. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=94.78s)]
*  It's a really growthy moment. That's really good for the American worker because it means [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=101.94s)]
*  their wages are going to head up. Well, we all have 401Ks, or most of us do, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=106.68s)]
*  and we also have to fill up our gas tanks. That's right. It's summer, and that's when [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=111.52s)]
*  the voter actually can see, when they pass the gas station, what the prices are. They're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=115.36s)]
*  passing it a lot every week. Yeah, exactly. All right, let's talk about GE. This is exciting [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  news too because GE is going to spend nearly $500 million to move production of their washing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=124.88s)]
*  machines from China to the Louisville, Kentucky headquarters. Yes. This is a couple things. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=130.0s)]
*  One, it's the tariff story, right? Because we still do have higher tariffs on China, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=137.44s)]
*  and companies don't want to pay that if they're selling these washing machines to Americans. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=141.84s)]
*  That's part of it. The other part of it is Trump is making America a really great place [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=146.32s)]
*  to build factories. That's the point of this tax bill. It's not just to have the stick [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=152.04s)]
*  of, hey, you might get a tariff. It's the carrot of build your stuff in the greatest [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=157.6s)]
*  place on earth to invest and grow. This is where GE Appliances customers are. They want [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=162.2s)]
*  to be near the customer. They want to be near the designers. It makes business sense to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  do this, but from sort of an American national security standpoint, it also makes a lot of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=172.48s)]
*  sense in that regard. It's kind of a win-win. It shows you the power of policy aligned with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  a very pro-capitalist view of the world. We finally got that back in America again. It's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  a perfect example. Everyone was flipping out over these tariffs, but now this is a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=191.4s)]
*  product of that. What's happening is you used to buy things from China because it was so [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=195.44s)]
*  much cheaper, but with the tariffs, it makes everything equal, right? Now companies are [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=199.56s)]
*  coming here because then we don't have to pay the tariff. It's going to be cheaper to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=205.18s)]
*  buy a washing machine from GE. Can I tell you, actually, some people freaked [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=208.24s)]
*  out about the tariffs. Smart companies started making plans, and smart investors put money [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  both of those sets of people are doing very well right now. Panic has been, time and again, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=219.32s)]
*  this year, the worst possible strategy for anybody to pursue. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much, Brian, for coming on. You bet. Good to see you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=230.4s)]
*  You can watch Brian on The Big Money Show. It's from noon to two o'clock in the afternoon [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Eastern time on Fox Business. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RiL0xvoPkA&t=236.56s)]
