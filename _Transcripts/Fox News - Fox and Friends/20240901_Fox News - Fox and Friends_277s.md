# We have a ‘much broader war’ on our hands, retired USAF general warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA)
*  A Fox News alert, six hostages, including one U.S. citizen, murdered by Hamas terrorists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=0.0s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=6.24s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu making it clear, nothing is off the table when it comes to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=7.24s)]
*  avenging their deaths. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=11.72s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about facing the war on terror. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=13.4s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Rob Spalding joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, General. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=20.6s)]
*  Obviously, we're waking up this morning to some pretty tragic news. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=21.6s)]
*  And among those that were executed now is one United States citizen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=25.16s)]
*  Does that change anything for the United States government and how we're responding to this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=30.08s)]
*  crisis? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=33.64s)]
*  Well, it certainly should. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=34.64s)]
*  If you remember, during the Trump administration and the Abraham Accords, what the Trump administration [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  sought to do was decouple the question of Palestine with regard to broader Middle East [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=43.0s)]
*  peace. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=49.32s)]
*  And they also did that along with suppressing Iran. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=50.32s)]
*  So I think one of the things that we have to recognize that this administration's pursuit [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=52.32s)]
*  of peace in the region isn't working. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=58.16s)]
*  And this is just one other example of it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=61.32s)]
*  When we look at the landscape, I believe there were, if my numbers are correct, around eight [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  U.S. citizens that were held hostage. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=68.8s)]
*  Four now are dead and there are four left in captivity. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=70.64s)]
*  Is there an obligation for the U.S. military to be actively on the ground to rescue Americans? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=75.12s)]
*  I know that there's a huge push from both sides of the aisle to keep us out of a new [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=80.16000000000001s)]
*  war. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  I've echoed those words myself. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  But is there a difference between being involved in a war and having surgical operations with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=87.0s)]
*  the assets we have to go in and rescue Americans? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=91.68s)]
*  Or is this just such a mess in that area that we couldn't do it? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  No, I don't see why we couldn't lend support. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=98.56s)]
*  I mean, here's the deal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=102.64s)]
*  We have been searching for our loss from wars all the way back to World War II, even World [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=104.32s)]
*  War I in Europe. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=111.36s)]
*  And we're still doing that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  We're looking for the lost in Korea. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  So I mean, these people are alive, possibly, and we owe an obligation to them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  They weren't lost in the battlefield as those others were. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  And at a minimum, we shouldn't be putting pressure on the Israelis. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  And furthermore, we should be thinking about the fact that we do have American citizens [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=132.4s)]
*  that are held hostage. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=136.8s)]
*  You're a United States Air Force general retired. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=137.8s)]
*  So you understand the top of the chain of command. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=140.68s)]
*  You understand how the decisions are made. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=143.72s)]
*  Pete and I were talking earlier on the couch here about the Tenets and Sun Tzu's art of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=146.52s)]
*  war, this idea that you don't conquer a people so much that they have nothing to lose because [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=150.72s)]
*  at that point they come back with full force. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=154.76s)]
*  You try to give them an opportunity to assimilate into the culture that's conquered them, not [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  to do a direct parallel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=162.16s)]
*  But Israel is the country in which Gaza is enveloped, even with a two state solution. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=163.52s)]
*  The people in Gaza have to learn to live with Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=168.8s)]
*  Do you see that as even an option at this point? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, when Israel originally left Gaza, the Palestinians controlled the territory [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  and then they use that territory to attack Israel on October 7th. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  So I don't think that there is any way that we're going to see the Palestinians or Hamas [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=189.2s)]
*  change their tune, no matter what the Israelis do. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=195.32s)]
*  This is this is the problem that we have. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=198.92s)]
*  And there has been overtures of peace for decades now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  And the Palestinians and Hamas have shown no interest in actually going after that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=206.12s)]
*  So no, I don't think I don't think we're going to see the Palestinians or Hamas change their [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  tune, no matter what Israel does, unfortunately. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=217.32s)]
*  We just have a few seconds left. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=220.4s)]
*  So short answer if you can. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=221.48s)]
*  If Israel is in a three border war in Gaza to the north and to the south with Hezbollah, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=223.68s)]
*  the Houthis and Hamas, does that mean the United States is involved directly? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=230.64s)]
*  Well, I think we're going to be involved because Iran is a big instigator, as you know, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  they're providing the resources and beyond that, China is supporting Iran. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=241.48s)]
*  So I think this is a much broader war, as I've said before, that is supported by this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=246.12s)]
*  this going cold war that we're in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=251.56s)]
*  And we just have to call it that and work on a strategy overall for the globe, of which [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=253.36s)]
*  the Middle East is a part. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=260.2s)]
*  General Spalding, thank you for your expertise. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=262.24s)]
*  Thanks for getting up and joining us this morning. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=263.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fEzKB8jICA&t=266.36s)]
