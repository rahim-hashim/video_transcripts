*  predicament because it would be hard for her to throw out a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  Democrat who is the mayor of New York City. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=222.67999999999998s)]

*  statement, you know it's up to the will of the voters she [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=253.16s)]
*  doesn't really want to overturn it and just kind of leave it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=255.5s)]
*  willy-nilly so we'll have to see what happens but that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=257.6s)]
*  meeting is just a few blocks away so we're going to have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=259.7s)]
*  there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=261.58s)]
*  Her lieutenant governor has even called for Adams to resign [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=262.74s)]
*  and she that lieutenant governor was hand picked by [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=265.74s)]
*  Hokel and she said in the 235 years of New York state history [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=269.04s)]
*  that the governor's power to remove an elected official has [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=272.82s)]
*  never been used so this would be a first right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=275.76s)]
*  Thanks. You know when I hear the word emergency meeting it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=278.48s)]
*  just really grinds my gear there was no emergency meeting [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  when an illegal set that woman on fire in the subway there has [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=285.82s)]
*  been no emergency meeting when people have been pushed into [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=289.82s)]
*  the subway shooting at our cops in the middle of the street, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=292.32s)]
*  no emergency meeting but suddenly when you got a guy [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=295.26s)]
*  who's the mayor working with the president in the United [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=298.56s)]
*  States to keep this city safe. All they want to do is get the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=300.5s)]
*  criminals off the street and suddenly there's emergency [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  meeting to get him removed but not when all of our lives have [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=306.56s)]
*  been put in place. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=309.42s)]
*  So Trump could pick up the phone and say I don't know what [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=310.42s)]
*  you're going to decide today but let me just tell you it's in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=312.12s)]
*  the best interest of the city to let the election play out and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=314.42s)]
*  that was the whole reason why his his Department of Justice [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=317.46s)]
*  stepped up because it said I don't care about his case but [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=320.9s)]
*  don't interfere with the election in 2020. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=324.14s)]
*  Also Lawrence you and I live in the city. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=326.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=329.14s)]
*  So we vote and I don't want the will of the people should be [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=330.24s)]
*  heard. You can't just pull someone off because you disagree [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=334.8s)]
*  with them. I can understand if if they're charged with a major [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=337.70000000000005s)]
*  crime but the DOJ dropped those charges so you can't just I [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=340.44000000000005s)]
*  don't think you should be able to remove someone that the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  voters voted in. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=346.18s)]
*  Well the DOJ dropped the charges because they said okay [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  we want him to cooperate with the president's migration [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=350.82000000000005s)]
*  problem here in New York City and it would interfere with that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=353.92s)]
*  election. Keep in mind the Department of Justice can [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  refile those charges at any time and so that's that's one of the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=361.68s)]
*  things but ultimately when it comes down to the will of the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=364.98s)]
*  people it's given the fact that this is like an 80 percent [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=366.82000000000005s)]
*  Democrat town will the Democrats at that primary punish Eric [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=371.86s)]
*  Adams for working with Donald Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0nauFuhznQ&t=377.42s)]
