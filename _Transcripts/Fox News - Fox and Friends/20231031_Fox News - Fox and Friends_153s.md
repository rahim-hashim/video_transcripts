# This is a 'nightmare scenario': Former US Marine
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY)
*  Meanwhile, switching back to our top story, as Israel intensifies its war in Gaza, Prime [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=0.0s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu making it clear nothing is off the table when it comes to avenging [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=4.9s)]
*  the brutal murders of more than 1,400 innocent Israelis on October the 7th. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  And our next guest says this is exactly the response Israel needs to fake out Hamas, U.S. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=14.6s)]
*  Marine vet and former Intel officer, Lieutenant Colonel John Myers joins us right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=19.88s)]
*  John, good morning to you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=24.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=26.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=27.16s)]
*  So for over a week, the IDF was shaping the battlefield. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=28.16s)]
*  Explain that and explain where we are now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=33.6s)]
*  Okay, so what they did over the last three weeks is basically the same as we would do [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=36.16s)]
*  in the Marine Corps, which is we call it shaping the battlefield. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=40.4s)]
*  You're softening up the battlefield with artillery, with aircraft launch munitions, with missiles [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=43.6s)]
*  in a hope to set the conditions for a ground invasion. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=49.36s)]
*  And then in the early stages, what you'll see is what the IDF did, which is probing, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=52.16s)]
*  running feints or in civilian terms, be like fake outs to sort of gauge what the response [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=56.0s)]
*  is before they start rolling the troops in heavy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=60.6s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing right now is the initial stages of them starting to roll [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=63.72s)]
*  in the troops heavy after shaping the battlefield for three weeks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=66.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=70.52s)]
*  And so this is kind of they haven't called it the ground invasion, but it sure looks [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=71.52s)]
*  like one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  But something's different. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  And that is the fact, Colonel, that apparently the IDF is saying that the IDF is actually [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  underground because once they took an area, there are tunnels and they are now fighting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=84.28s)]
*  the bad guys in the tunnels. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  So this situation is a nightmare scenario. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, from a Marine perspective, the worst kind of warfare is urban warfare, tunnel warfare, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  and fighting a force that intertangles itself with the civilian population. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=102.72s)]
*  And they're trying to do all three at the same time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=106.82s)]
*  So they're going into these tunnels after they secure an area. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=109.6s)]
*  They'll go into the tunnels. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=113.4s)]
*  They're using some unique technologies that people are calling a sponge bomb, which is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=114.4s)]
*  basically a chemical reaction set off by an explosive charge that fills the tunnels with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=118.12s)]
*  a foam that hardens to concrete. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=123.64s)]
*  Technically, it's non-lethal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=126.56s)]
*  It's not designed to kill people, but it's designed to shut off those tunnels for anybody [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=127.92s)]
*  else to use. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=131.72s)]
*  Well, they had a plan and they certainly are executing it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=132.72s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel John Myers, sir, thank you very much for joining us today from Virginia. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=135.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=141.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=142.12s)]
*  I'm juicy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=143.12s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvNX7hGRlY&t=144.12s)]
