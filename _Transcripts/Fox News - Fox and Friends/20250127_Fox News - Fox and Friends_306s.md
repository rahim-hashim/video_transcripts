*  from LA Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=8.68s)]
*  Listen to this exchange. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=10.28s)]
*  They are saying they will not be allowed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  to start for 18 months. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=14.92s)]
*  No, that will not be the case. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=16.32s)]
*  Okay, I just hope you're right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=17.96s)]
*  You can hold me to it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=19.52s)]
*  Four groups said that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=20.76s)]
*  No. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=21.82s)]
*  That would be it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=22.66s)]
*  They should be able to do it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=23.5s)]
*  They should be able to start tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=24.82s)]
*  I'm exercising my emergency powers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=25.86s)]

*  I did exercise them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=30.54s)]
*  I signed an emergency declaration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=31.939999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you have a very powerful emergency power, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=33.8s)]

*  This is the thing that usually happens behind closed doors. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=38.5s)]
*  It happened in front of the cameras. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=40.68s)]
*  Joining us now is a Pacific Palisades resident, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=42.08s)]
*  not just any resident, the CEO of Body by Jake Global, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=44.68s)]
*  Jake Steinfeld. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=48.12s)]
*  Jake, what did that exchange, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  how did it echo the frustrations [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=50.62s)]
*  that all of you feel two weeks, three weeks later? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=52.96s)]
*  First of all, Bri, it's great to be here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=56.2s)]
*  I'm always with you as a resident of the Palisades [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=58.76s)]
*  and a homeless resident of the Palisades. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=62.0s)]
*  My house burned down, as you know. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=65.6s)]
*  Seeing the president come to town in our firehouse 69, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=67.84s)]
*  sitting down with Karen Bess, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=71.28s)]
*  it was absolutely amazing to hear his words. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=74.74s)]
*  We've all been hearing about 18 months, we can't get in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=77.92s)]
*  The psychological damage to all of us, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=80.88s)]
*  staring, if you're able to get to see your house, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=83.78s)]
*  staring at the rubble, continues to wear on you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=86.74s)]
*  I could tell you that from my life [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=89.72s)]
*  has always been about don't quit. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=91.38s)]
*  And hearing what the president said about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  this can be done in a day, get it done in a day, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=95.38s)]
*  not a week, but a day, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=97.96s)]
*  where we can get people in, our own people, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=100.2s)]
*  to move the crummy stuff, get the crap out, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=102.36s)]
*  scrape the land, visualize what it can be and will be. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=105.12s)]
*  That's what I love about this guy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=109.16s)]
*  I mean, you know, President Trump understands, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=110.84s)]
*  he visualizes success. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=113.34s)]
*  His son will come up and to see him do what he did [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=115.86s)]
*  just with that moment, I get fired up about it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=119.3s)]
*  You know, I was the honorary mayor of Pacific Palisades. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=121.7s)]
*  I've got ideas, I've got plans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=124.58s)]
*  I wanna help the president oversee [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=126.14s)]
*  what can be done and what will be done [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=129.68s)]
*  to keep people accountable on a daily basis. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  Because right now, it's raining here, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=134.26s)]
*  I still haven't, we're still not able [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=136.22s)]
*  to get up to our homes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  And there's no reason for it too. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=139.66s)]
*  And you know, you've started four to six [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=141.06s)]
*  major successful businesses, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=142.46s)]
*  you've got everything from lacrosse [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=144.28s)]
*  to the first ever personal fitness trainer. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  So you got $550 million in 2024 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=148.42s)]
*  that Pacific Palisades paid out in taxes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  Where's that money? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=153.92s)]
*  You got the average house is 4.5 million, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=155.16s)]
*  where's that money? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=157.5s)]
*  Alta Dena, working class area, where's the money? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=158.7s)]
*  You can't even fix a reservoir. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  And last night, I understand Pacific Palisades [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=163.6s)]
*  had a town hall and it got out of control [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  because the frustration is overwhelming. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=168.7s)]
*  And this is what, maybe you wanna put a voice to that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=171.96s)]
*  Right, it's just about, all these people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=175.7s)]
*  are doing is talking. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=177.5s)]
*  They're just talking, they're not doing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=178.64s)]
*  As an entrepreneur, we know how to make things happen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=180.6s)]
*  And the thing about entrepreneurs is that, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=184.04s)]
*  look, you know what you know and you get [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=186.14s)]
*  the right people in place to be able to take action. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=187.82s)]
*  That's what I love about this new administration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=191.04s)]
*  Trump's second administration, you see what he's doing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=193.12s)]
*  He's getting the right people in place. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=195.28s)]
*  What I wanna do is basically say, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=197.0s)]
*  I know the president watches this show [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=199.9s)]
*  every single morning, let me be this rebuilt czar [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  and of Palisades, Alta Dena, we'll call it Paladena, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=205.62s)]
*  the Paladena Project, whatever we wanna call it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=209.5s)]
*  But I wanna be able to oversee and to be able to help [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=212.34s)]
*  implement the change, not the talk. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=215.58s)]
*  So Jake, I wanna talk about too what could change. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  I want you to see this quote from a Democratic strategist [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=220.18s)]
*  to talk about what's changing in California. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=222.78000000000003s)]
*  This is the frustration. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  For most of the 20th century, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=225.9s)]
*  California was an entirely Republican state. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=227.7s)]
*  On the list of things he could accomplish [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=230.18s)]
*  if he decides not to be vengeful is the possibility [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=231.96s)]
*  that he could help accomplish a pretty significant shift [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=235.06s)]
*  in electoral balance by getting things done [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=237.92s)]
*  for a Democratic city and a Democratic state. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=241.06s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=244.26s)]
*  I think it's 100% true. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  As you know, buddy, I'm about, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=247.42s)]
*  it's not to me about the red or blue, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=249.44s)]
*  it's about the red, white and blue. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=251.2s)]
*  And I know that this is what this president stands for. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=253.06s)]
*  It's about making the Palisades out to Dena [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=255.74s)]
*  and everywhere else that there have been catastrophes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=258.86s)]
*  We're living in it right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=261.54s)]
*  It's gonna happen again. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=263.3s)]
*  Let's figure out ways how to make change. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=264.94s)]
*  That's what it, this isn't checkers. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=267.74s)]
*  This is chess. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=270.16s)]
*  This is psychological now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=271.18s)]
*  And my whole life has been about don't quit, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  that poem I was given, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=274.86s)]
*  Stick to the fight when your hardest hit. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=276.1s)]
*  It's when things seem worst that you must not quit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=278.14s)]
*  We have to start right this second [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=280.94s)]
*  and make moves to help people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  And Jake, after that, you become the czar [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  and then you become the governor. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  That will be my goal for you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  Jake Steinfeld, thanks so much. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdlaa22ELnA&t=290.6s)]
