# 'Just a coincidence': The NY Times finally reported this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE)
*  So one thing that one of the ripple effects of President Biden no longer running for office is it's open season on Hunter case in point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=0.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden reportedly asked the U.S. embassy in Italy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  This is paperwork we've been waiting for for help landing a deal with the barisma of Ukraine while his dad was V.P. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=9.4s)]
*  The New York Times finally reporting this quote records indicate that Hunter Biden wrote at least one letter to the U.S. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=17.3s)]
*  In Italy in 2016 seeking assistance for the Ukrainian gas company where he was a board member. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=24.7s)]
*  But in 2019 then candidate Biden swore he knew nothing about his son's overseas business dealings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=31.1s)]
*  I did not know he was on the board of that company. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=38.9s)]
*  I've never discussed my business or their business, my sons or daughters. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=42.4s)]
*  I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=46.6s)]
*  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=50.6s)]
*  I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with their businesses. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=53.2s)]
*  Period. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  Abby Lowe came out and said no meeting actually occurred. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  No project materialized. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  No request for anything in the U.S. was ever sought. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=66.4s)]
*  Only an introduction. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Spinn. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  Hunter's lawyer tells the Times that the meeting never happened. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=72.7s)]
*  Now and the White House says that President Biden did not know about his son reaching out to the embassy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=76.4s)]
*  It's been clueless, huh? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=81.2s)]
*  Who appoints these ambassadors? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=82.1s)]
*  It would be Barack Obama and Joe Biden, their administration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=84.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=87.1s)]
*  These documents, this letter, this letter, which by the way when the New York Times got it, it was completely redacted. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  It was just completely blacked out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=95.6s)]
*  When the New York Times got this, this so happened to be right after Joe Biden had dropped out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=97.1s)]
*  Coincidence. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Apparently it had been withheld by the Biden administration for years until the New York Times did a FOIA request, a Freedom of Information Act request, and they wouldn't give it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  And then the New York Times sued. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  So the New York Times has been working on that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  And that's how we wound up with this particular damning document. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=120.6s)]
*  The Department of State, which has been holding on to it, says the timing is coincidental, which seems kind of fishy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=125.1s)]
*  Now was this, which ambassador, was this the Italian ambassador to the United States or was this our ambassador that was sent there to live in Italy? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=132.7s)]
*  Our ambassador. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=140.4s)]
*  Our ambassador. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=141.1s)]
*  So his dad's friend or Barack Obama's friend. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=141.9s)]
*  Well his colleague. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=144.4s)]
*  And you see some of the communication, just like we're saying now, like should we be doing this? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=145.1s)]
*  I don't think we should be giving this information. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=149.9s)]
*  Is this in our best interest? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=152.4s)]
*  Just like we saw the text messages for Barack Obama's administration, why is Joe Biden's son on the board of Barismo when part of his portfolio is Ukraine? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=153.9s)]
*  At the very beginning, the Obama administration, the White House Council Office, had warned Joe Biden that this is not, they shouldn't be doing this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=162.1s)]
*  This is not something they should be doing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=168.2s)]
*  But you knew nothing about it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=168.9s)]
*  But by the way, the fact that they're openly saying, oh it was just a coincidence that they decided to turn over the documents right after Joe Biden was no longer on the ticket, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=169.9s)]
*  when there could be no political pressure on him anymore. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=180.6s)]
*  And you guys believe that, New York Times? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=183.4s)]
*  You really believe that it was only a coincidence? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=186.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=188.4s)]
*  Ultimately, Brian, to your point about the embassy staff, them going, I don't know if we can help him, we don't want to do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=189.0s)]
*  It wasn't because they don't help businesses all the time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=197.4s)]
*  They probably do help grease the skids and stuff like that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=200.0s)]
*  The problem was the fact that Joe Biden was the vice president at the time. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=203.8s)]
*  And it's like, this doesn't look good. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=207.8s)]
*  We shouldn't be helping them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=210.8s)]
*  I don't want to hear anything else about the Trump kids. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=212.0s)]
*  They were in business before they even got into the administration. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=213.5s)]
*  And if there was even a shred of evidence like this, there would be calls for investigations and all of that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=217.1s)]
*  He had no real business. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=223.9s)]
*  He used his dad to care favor. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=225.8s)]
*  Can you as an average day businessman just call an ambassador and get them to help you out? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=229.0s)]
*  Everybody knows it was only because his dad was the vice president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=234.0s)]
*  That actually eliminates you from doing it if your dad's the vice president because it looks like dual use. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=237.5s)]
*  Well, hats off to the New York Times for getting the story. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=241.9s)]
*  They sued for a while to get it and now we know. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=243.9s)]
*  But Joe's not running. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  See, Carl, if you didn't work here, you could use our names to get yourself good tables and things. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=249.5s)]
*  But now it's a conflict of interest. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=253.1s)]
*  I was thinking, I was thinking Brian would say, Carly's dad's not the vice president. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=254.8s)]
*  No, that would have been better. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=260.2s)]
*  It's like playing a game of chess. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=262.6s)]
*  You're practicing my awkward tosses. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_qrQWjnxeE&t=264.0s)]
