# Latinos will be a big part of Trump taking battleground state: Political consultant
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4)
*  Honestly, November 5th is going to be the most important day in the history of our country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=0.0s)]
*  I really believe it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=5.76s)]
*  So Nevada, get out and vote. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=8.16s)]
*  We win this state, we're going to win the whole thing. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=10.76s)]
*  We win this, we're going to win the whole thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=13.52s)]
*  Former President Trump rallying in Las Vegas last night, telling voters that a victory [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=16.96s)]
*  in Nevada could be the key to the White House. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=21.5s)]
*  And while Trump lost the state in the last two election cycles, the latest polls have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=24.48s)]
*  them virtually tied. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=28.52s)]
*  Jesus Marquez is a Las Vegas political consultant and the spokesman for a Latino coalition [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=29.96s)]
*  that backs Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=35.6s)]
*  And he joins us now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=37.12s)]
*  Welcome Jesus. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=38.12s)]
*  It's great to have you on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=39.12s)]
*  So the number in Nevada that I have is 54 Harris, 41 Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=40.44s)]
*  Do you think that there is a chance that Trump could overtake Harris in Nevada? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=45.68s)]
*  With Hispanics? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Now the number you mentioned is on Latinos, Hispanics. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Remember? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=54.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=55.92s)]
*  And the Republican candidate got over 40 percent or even over 30 percent of the Latino vote [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=56.92s)]
*  and Donald Trump is doing exactly that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=61.6s)]
*  Absolutely, we can take Nevada and Latinos will be a big part of that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=63.72s)]
*  And it's because Latinos are hurting just like any other American Americans. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=67.68s)]
*  And Donald Trump is a solution for that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=71.52s)]
*  So let's talk really quick about immigration because immigration is such an interesting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=73.92s)]
*  topic with Latinos because I think Democrats thought when they opened the border that this [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=76.92s)]
*  was a positive for Hispanics, that they would win Hispanics over because they would be able [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=81.4s)]
*  to paint anybody who wanted to control immigration as a racist or somebody who's anti-immigrant. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=85.48s)]
*  Why has illegal immigration been actually a driver towards Trump for Hispanics? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=93.04s)]
*  Oh, that's because when Hispanics, when Latinos look at what's happening at the border, we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=99.92s)]
*  don't like it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=105.16s)]
*  We don't like the fact that in the last three and a half years, more than 10 million, even [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=106.16s)]
*  some people say over about 20 million undocumented people have come in across jumping the line, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=110.28s)]
*  taking services, such as services that never were offered to other Hispanics. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=116.68s)]
*  And now Latinos who are the working class of America or at least part of the working [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  class of America are paying for those services. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=125.22s)]
*  They don't like the fact that the border is wide open and they see that the cost of this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=128.32s)]
*  of being Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=133.4s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=136.36s)]
*  So you rightfully pointed to the number one issue facing Hispanics, who as you rightly [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=137.92s)]
*  say are solidly part of the working class in America. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Hispanic Americans care about inflation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris was offered a chance to answer a question about inflation and what she would [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=148.56s)]
*  do about it at the debate. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=153.56s)]
*  And then if you're watching our show, you just saw that there's a local reporter in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=154.56s)]
*  Pennsylvania who also asked her about it and she didn't answer. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=158.27999999999997s)]
*  She started talking about her lawn and her mom. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=161.92s)]
*  What kind of reaction will Hispanics have to that kind of evasion, to something that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=164.48s)]
*  so directly impacts their lives? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=169.6s)]
*  Well Rachel is because Kamala Harris is dodging the question because she's the cause of inflation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  And yes, this is absolutely affecting Latino families in America. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  You know, the working class, including Hispanics, we are working, you know, just to put food [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=182.6s)]
*  on the table, to get our kids to college, to open a small business, to buy our new home. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=187.48s)]
*  And all those things have been, you know, just taken away because of inflation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  The cost of living is way up to the roof. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=197.52s)]
*  And all this is because of the high spending of the government. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=199.8s)]
*  What Kamala Harris has done in the last three and a half years has affected this tremendously. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=202.32s)]
*  And we don't like that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=207.08s)]
*  We want to have the same economy that we had when Donald Trump was in office, where everything [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=208.08s)]
*  was really good. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=212.08s)]
*  And part of that is also the border. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=213.72s)]
*  You know, when you have millions of millions of undocumented people coming across the border, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=215.84s)]
*  taking the jobs of all the Latinos, that's another thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=220.08s)]
*  These people are competing with Hispanics, not with other groups. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=222.72s)]
*  So definitely not good for the Latino community. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=230.44s)]
*  You know, Cesar Chavez understood that way back in the day, he would say he did not want [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=231.44s)]
*  illegal immigration because he said it was going to drive the wages down of Hispanic [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=235.32s)]
*  Americans. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=239.72s)]
*  That's happening right now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=240.72s)]
*  And you're right to point that out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=241.72s)]
*  Jesus Marquez, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=242.72s)]
*  And we'll see what happens in Nevada. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=245.76s)]
*  It's going to be a clincher. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=247.0s)]
*  One last thing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=248.0s)]
*  One last thing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=249.0s)]
*  Ticks on taps and no tax on tips and no tax on overtime. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=250.0s)]
*  That's going to also affect benefit Latinos. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=253.48s)]
*  We look forward for that too. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=255.8s)]
*  Yeah, that is a great issue for Nevada specifically. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=257.64s)]
*  Great point. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=261.8s)]
*  Thank you, Jesus. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=262.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=263.8s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykIcVVxB9A4&t=264.8s)]
