# Lawrence Jones asks GOP leader: Who is running the country?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow)
*  So shipping containers already piling up at sea as the dock workers strike enters its third day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=0.0s)]
*  And as concerns grow over the state of the economy, manufacturers are calling on Biden or Congress to take action. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=6.0s)]
*  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise joins us now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=13.0s)]
*  Is Congress going to step in here? It looks like the president has made it very clear. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=15.0s)]
*  He's standing with the workers right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=21.0s)]
*  Right now under the law, Lawrence is going to be with you, taft-heartedly allows the president to intervene and break it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=23.0s)]
*  The president said we're just going to let it go on and wreck the economy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=28.0s)]
*  We're losing over five billion dollars a day and costs are going to start going up even higher on families who are already struggling under the Biden-Harris inflation economy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=31.0s)]
*  Food on the shelves is going to become more scarce. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=41.0s)]
*  You know, if you look at Congress, I mean, in the House, we're surely not going to support some kind of deal that says no automation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=43.0s)]
*  Imagine that they want to go back to the Flintstones. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=49.0s)]
*  I mean, I would bet you they've got more technology and automation in their homes and their refrigerator and their smart TV than they want to have on a dock when we're competing globally. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=51.0s)]
*  We're not just competing one city against another. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=59.0s)]
*  You know, you've got ports all around the world that are heavily automated and they still have humans, by the way, who actually run the devices. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=62.0s)]
*  These automated devices aren't running themselves, but they're already making with overtime over two hundred thousand dollars a year in some cases. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=69.0s)]
*  And they want to shut the economy down to get more at some point. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=76.0s)]
*  Who pays for this? And this will add even more to inflation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=79.0s)]
*  There are a lot of families making fifty thousand a year that are saying, please stop adding to the costs and Biden and Harris won't do anything because they want to see those prices. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=82.0s)]
*  You all have the president looks like he's going to stay out of it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=91.0s)]
*  He's not going to use an act. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=94.0s)]
*  But what can you guys do to make sure this doesn't get crazy? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look again, if the House and Senate had some kind of kind of close symmetry on how to resolve it, that would be one thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=101.0s)]
*  There is none. You know, can you imagine us in a room with Chuck Schumer and he's siding with them saying ban automation? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=107.0s)]
*  You know, this isn't the 1950s. We're in 2024. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=113.0s)]
*  We have a lot of technology that could be implemented to to actually make us more efficient. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=116.0s)]
*  Wouldn't be less jobs. It would just be more efficient jobs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=121.0s)]
*  And they want to block that. We're not going to support that kind of backward thinking. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=124.0s)]
*  Mr. Leader, I've been watching what's happening in Israel and it looks like their prime minister is going on the offense. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=129.0s)]
*  He's taken out not just their enemies, but he's taken out our enemies as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=134.0s)]
*  He's also going out there to get his hostages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=139.0s)]
*  The next step is Iran. What do we do there? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=143.0s)]
*  The president was asked about what Israel should do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=145.0s)]
*  This is what he had to say. Watch. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=149.0s)]
*  Would you support an attack on Iranian nuclear sites by Israel? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=151.0s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=156.0s)]
*  And I think there's things that will be discussed with the Israelis, what they're going to do. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=159.0s)]
*  But they have all seven of us agree that they have a right to respond, that they should respond and force. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=166.0s)]
*  So, Mr. Leader, those nuclear sites aren't just a threat to Israel, but a threat to us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=173.0s)]
*  So why is the president being so cavalier and saying no? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah, this has been a problem under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris since the day they took office. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=182.0s)]
*  They reversed all the sanctions that President Trump took in place that were crippling Iran's economy to go and support terrorism around the world. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=187.0s)]
*  Iran's made about a hundred billion dollars, Lawrence, selling their oil on world markets since Joe Biden took off those Trump sanctions that were working to cripple Iran's economy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=194.0s)]
*  So now Iran's making all this money. They're funding terrorism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=204.0s)]
*  Hamas, October 7th, came out of that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=207.0s)]
*  You know, the hoodies that are attacking our troops and Biden just sits back and does nothing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=209.0s)]
*  Kamala does nothing. Let them defend themselves. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=213.0s)]
*  Israel has a right to self-defense, whatever it is, including nuclear sites. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=216.0s)]
*  We're looking at these last pictures of Beirut right now where an explosion has happened as well. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=219.0s)]
*  Mrs. Speaker, before I let you go, I just got to ask you, who's running the country? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=225.0s)]
*  We see Joe Biden on the beach. He comes to the White House whenever he wants to. Kamala Harris is on the campaign trail. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=229.0s)]
*  The cabinet members are just on the Sunday shows as allies of Kamala Harris. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=234.0s)]
*  You're in leadership of our government, but who's running the country right now? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=239.0s)]
*  It's a really scary thought. You know, when you look at some of the bills we passed, we passed bills to secure the southern border. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=243.0s)]
*  Joe Biden came out, said he's against it. Kamala Harris said she's against it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=249.0s)]
*  We have bills to produce our own American energy so we don't need to give Iran and Russia billions of dollars a month. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=253.0s)]
*  President Biden and Kamala Harris oppose that. So you see a clear divide. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=260.0s)]
*  The country's going to speak really loudly on this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=264.0s)]
*  And I think J.D. Vance said it best at the debate the other night. Kamala Harris talks about what she'd do on the first day. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=266.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris's first day was 1,400 days ago. And look at the results. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=272.0s)]
*  The world's on fire. Americans can't drive to go to the grocery store, let alone put food on the table. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=276.0s)]
*  Mr. Leader, thank you so much for giving us this time. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=281.0s)]
*  Thank you, Kamala Harris. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyTFd1JQow&t=290.0s)]
