# 'RUNAWAY PRODUCTION': Producer warns of 'biggest threat' to Hollywood
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI)
*  Right now, Hollywood reeling in the wake of those devastating fires as more productions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=0.0s)]
*  are forced out of the state or put on hold. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=4.84s)]
*  Our next guest has spent decades in the industry and Warren's California is on the verge of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=7.98s)]
*  losing it all for good. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=12.42s)]
*  Producer and production manager Michael Miller joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=16.22s)]
*  Michael, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=19.66s)]
*  So what's the big threat to California right now? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=21.2s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=24.7s)]
*  The biggest threat right now, there's a phrase that we've coined called runaway production, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=26.94s)]
*  actually runaway post-production as well, which is so many shows and movies have been [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=32.18s)]
*  enticed to go work in other states because states are offering huge tax incentives to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=37.3s)]
*  bring that business to them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=43.22s)]
*  So over the last few years, California has lost about $10 billion and almost 40,000 jobs [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  in production to states like Georgia, New Mexico and Louisiana. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=53.62s)]
*  Combine that with the fires that we're dealing with right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=59.26s)]
*  People have been looking for work and they don't have a choice. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=62.94s)]
*  They have nowhere to go. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  They have no homes and now the jobs are leaving. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=68.94s)]
*  Makes it very tough for people to stay and keep the industry working in California right [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=72.78s)]
*  now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=76.92s)]
*  So there's this petition going around, as you mentioned, 6,000 people is not that much [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=77.92s)]
*  yet. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=82.34s)]
*  It just started. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=83.34s)]
*  There are a lot of big names coming on to it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=84.34s)]
*  But there is a real push to get California to match these other incentives and to keep [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=86.22s)]
*  the jobs here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=92.98s)]
*  People are really, really struggling. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=93.98s)]
*  So Michael, for those who don't know who you are, I mean, you are a big time producer. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=95.96s)]
*  Your job is basically if somebody has a movie or a TV show, they come to you and they go, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=99.5s)]
*  how much does it cost if I do it in L.A., if I do it in Georgia, if I do it in Las Vegas, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  if I do it in Ireland, in Australia, which is where a lot of these are going. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=109.94s)]
*  So it's not just that we're in danger of losing Hollywood as we know it, but also that it's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=113.78s)]
*  not just going to move to Georgia. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=120.14s)]
*  It can move to Ireland or somewhere else. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=121.62s)]
*  So these states are offering incentives, tax incentives. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=123.5s)]
*  Why doesn't California and why doesn't Hollywood itself do more to encourage your government [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=126.88s)]
*  in California to make a more business friendly environment? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=134.34s)]
*  That is an excellent question. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  And California does have incentives, but they were never the nearly what they are in other [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=140.82s)]
*  states and to go overseas for sure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  Right now there's a bill waiting the governor's reviewing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=151.64s)]
*  But of course, it has the over regulation and a lot of rules that are standard for California. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=155.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  They love to overregulate everything. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  At this time when we're expediting permits and waivers to rebuild homes and this is the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=164.86s)]
*  time when the legislature needs to get together and match what those other incentives are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=173.02s)]
*  and to make it a fair playing field for us, because right now it's really not fair at all. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=178.86s)]
*  Well, that's what's interesting about it, because you know what? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=185.02s)]
*  Californians, they got to take this into their own hands. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=188.02s)]
*  They elect these people that raise these taxes and make life so expensive and put all these [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  rules and regulations into it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=195.82s)]
*  And so, you know, it's kind of hard to say, hey, well, the rest of America should supplement this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=196.82s)]
*  I agree with you completely. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=202.82s)]
*  And, you know, the president and his administration are very focused on common sense. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=205.82s)]
*  I would hope that the California state legislature can have that same kind of common sense and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=210.82s)]
*  really do what's right here and what's needed to keep the jobs in California. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=216.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=220.82s)]
*  Nobody wants to see people suffer along the way. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  And I think entertainment as a whole, the United States does it better than the entire rest of the world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  It is a competitive advantage for the United States and we need to keep that in all segments of entertainment. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Michael Viller, really do appreciate joining us on Fox and Friends. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for your time, Mr. Haring. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  You guys, Donald Trump has appointed Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone, and John Voight to be ambassadors of Hollywood. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  This is one of the topics, among others, but at the top of the list is making, you know, keeping Hollywood in California [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=250.78s)]
*  and not letting it, you know, be offshored or sent to other states. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  California has to take it under, you know, has to take responsibility. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  But maybe with some leadership from Donald Trump, we might see some action. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, AI is also going to play a role in this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  I think the industry is under attack from a lot of things. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a great point. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  But let's also be clear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=276.78s)]
*  Every cost of living cost that is, you know, piled on California residents with government regulations makes it more difficult for the... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=277.78s)]
*  It does. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=290.78s)]
*  I know a lot of people watching, and I'll end on this, a lot of people watching go, well, it's L.A., it's, you know, they don't vote for concerns. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=291.78s)]
*  Hollywood is America, and you're right. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=298.78s)]
*  We export culture and we export Hollywood, and it's America. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=300.78s)]
*  And so hopefully the America first president will save Hollywood. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evdoaf_ibgI&t=305.78s)]
