**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U)
*  Celebrities with connections to the southeast are looking to help the region [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=0.0s)]
*  recover from two major hurricanes in recent weeks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=4.2s)]
*  Former Tampa Bay Buccaneer Rob Gronkowski donating $100,000 of his own money as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=7.32s)]
*  he works to raise funds for those who are struggling in Florida. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=12.84s)]
*  And Gronk joins us now. Gronk, great to see you here this morning on Fox and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=15.84s)]
*  Friends. You played a year in Tampa Bay. You've got some connection to the area. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=19.76s)]
*  Talk to me about what inspired you to jump in, start helping Florida. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=24.72s)]
*  Yeah, how you doing, man? Sunday morning, I just woke up. It's football today, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=27.6s)]
*  so I'm all excited. I have the week off of Fox, the pregame show, so I'll be [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  watching my guys. I'm super pumped to see that. But a couple of days ago, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  I was just talking with my little brother, Glenn, about donating to a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  foundation for the hurricane, Millen and Hurricane, you know, Helene Relief. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=47.6s)]
*  And my brother was like, Hey, why don't you just start your own GoFundMe? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=53.52s)]
*  Because you want to donate and then you could raise more money as well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=56.32s)]
*  So that's what inspired me. He set up a GoFundMe page. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=59.6s)]
*  So the page, if you guys want to donate, please, we're asking anyone. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=62.4s)]
*  Any contribution will help. Go to Gronk's Hurricane Relief for Hurricane [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=66.56s)]
*  Millen and Hurricane Helene on GoFundMe. Please donate. Please help out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=71.56s)]
*  I already put a big contribution in. We are really far away from our goal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=76.52s)]
*  So we need everyone's help. Please go on and just contribute any amount, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  even five dollars will help out to our goal and will help out tremendously for [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=85.48s)]
*  the victims of the hurricane. I think it's I think the link Gronk is up on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=90.44000000000001s)]
*  your Instagram. And that right. So people can also find it right there on your [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=94.68s)]
*  I.G. Man, I had as someone who has done something like what you're doing right [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=98.2s)]
*  now, I know how much work and how much potential help you have the ability to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=102.92s)]
*  offer people in that area. You know, this is something that the audience knows [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  for me a year ago in Maui was a big deal. So but it comes from your heart. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=110.28s)]
*  It has to come from someplace that you know you can do something and you know [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  you care. You spent that year in Tampa. Is that what it was? Just connected to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  this area? Know these people want to help this place? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. I played two years in Tampa. My mom actually lives two hours away from [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=125.84s)]
*  Tampa in Fort Myers. So this is actually her third hurricane that she went [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=132.36s)]
*  through in the last two years. Luckily enough, she's inland about 20 miles, so [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=136.52s)]
*  she never had a deal with any of the storm surge. But she has so many friends [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  and family members as well that have dealt with the storm surge and just [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=145.56s)]
*  wiped out their whole entire house and and being in the Tampa Bay area as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=149.56s)]
*  We just took on the two hurricanes over the last two weeks. I have so many [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  friends and family members down there in that area as well. So just to have that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  connection in the sports world and then also to have that connection in the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  business world as well because I started a couple businesses in Tampa, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=167.64s)]
*  especially a quick service restaurant. Green Lane, which is a salad and wrap, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=172.6s)]
*  you know, quick service restaurant. So my business partner and I, he actually [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=177.6s)]
*  contributed big time to the fund as well. So just having that connection in the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  sports world and business world, I want to get Tampa booming. I want to get [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSpSX-AL7U&t=185.6s)]
