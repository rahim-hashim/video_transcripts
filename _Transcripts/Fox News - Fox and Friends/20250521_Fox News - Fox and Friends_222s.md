# SCOTUS orders state to revoke censure of GOP lawmaker for trans athlete post
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA)
*  The Supreme Court ordering Maine state legislature to restore state representative Laurel Libby's voting power after she was censured back in February for this post about a girls pole vaulting competition saying quote, another day, another instance of a remarkable, unremarkable biological male athlete who couldn't win against other males dominating girls sports. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=0.0s)]
*  Here to discuss is Maine state representative Laurel Libby. Good morning to you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=23.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. You're welcome. You had your day in court and you won seven to two. The Supreme Court voted in your favor. How do you feel? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=28.0s)]
*  I am so thankful on behalf of my constituents, 9000 of whom have not had a vote in the state house for almost three months, but also for the Constitution. This case has far reaching consequences, not just in Maine, but across the country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=37.0s)]
*  And I'm thankful that the Supreme Court has recognized the dangerous precedent that would have been set if I had been allowed to continue to be silenced. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=51.0s)]
*  Representative, who's responsible for this? I want names. I think the voters in Maine need to know who's behind this and who tried to censure you and did censure you for three months so your voters didn't have a voice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=61.0s)]
*  The Democrat majority voted in a block led by Speaker Ryan Fecto to silence my 9000 constituents and leave them without a vote for, as you said, almost three months. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=72.0s)]
*  That that should not even be allowed. And clearly the Supreme Court agrees with that. If you look at what your state or how your state feels about this one issue, the majority don't want biological men playing against their little girls. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=83.0s)]
*  It's 64% in the survey said that they shouldn't be allowed. 29% said they should be allowed and 7% were unsure. This is from the University of New Hampshire. This is a survey from their center. What is your response to that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=96.0s)]
*  Two thirds of Mainers don't think the biological males should be participating in girls sports. And to see a sitting legislator silenced in political retaliation for sharing that view that most Mainers have is reprehensible. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=110.0s)]
*  So I'm so thankful that the Supreme Court has rectified the situation. We do have the case still pending before the First Circuit Court of Appeals, but I'm thankful to have the ability to now vote while that case proceeds. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, is this just an issue? Why did this happen in Maine? Don't the people, the lawmakers, the people that were voted into office, don't they see these surveys? Don't they realize what their constituents want? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=136.0s)]
*  I think they didn't realize how far out over their skis they were until it was too late. And when you double down like that, there's not a graceful way to exit. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=147.0s)]
*  And so I don't think we would have seen any recourse for my constituents had the Supreme Court not stepped in. And thankfully, tomorrow I will be back in the chamber voting on behalf of my constituents. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=157.0s)]
*  How do you feel about going back? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=169.0s)]
*  I'm thrilled. It has been certainly a weighty burden to not be able to vote on behalf of my constituents who elected me into office. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=171.0s)]
*  And so it's a relief to be able to now go in and cast votes on their behalf and ensure that their voice is heard and that they have representation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=183.0s)]
*  Right. Any Democrats, did they come up to you and say, we regret this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=192.0s)]
*  No. I got a text from one yesterday who said, come on in and vote. But other than that, crickets. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=197.0s)]
*  Wow. All right. Well, welcome back. Thank you so much for coming on this morning. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=205.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=210.0s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RjB5VJclKA&t=211.0s)]
