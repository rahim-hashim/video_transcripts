# 'Bad blood?': Melania Trump reportedly declines Jill Biden White House meeting
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg)
*  All right, this is the big story out of DC president-elect Donald Trump appears to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=0.0s)]
*  tapping a number of very familiar faces if you watch television for key jobs in his new [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=8.4s)]
*  White House and we now have new details this morning on his DHS back. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=14.4s)]
*  Mark Meredith is in West Palm Beach, Florida on the Trump transition team. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=18.88s)]
*  We're talking about the team mark. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=22.56s)]
*  Hey, good morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=24.64s)]
*  Ainsley, Steve, Brian and Lawrence. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=26.6s)]
*  Good morning, friends. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=27.8s)]
*  Moments ago, one of our friends, Brooke Sigman, was able to confirm the news which [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=28.520000000000003s)]
*  broke overnight that South Dakota governor Kristi Noem is expected to be tapped as the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  We'll wait to see what kind of reaction comes out of Washington, but this is certainly big news. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=38.36s)]
*  Noem was somewhat a bit on the short list for vice president a few months ago and it was unclear [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=42.2s)]
*  what kind of role she was going to serve in the Trump administration and now we know. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=46.36s)]
*  We have yet to hear from the governor though on the news. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=50.28s)]
*  President-elect Trump has been calling on the Senate to move quickly to approve his [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=53.08s)]
*  nominees. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=56.04s)]
*  New overnight, we've also learned who he hopes to lead the State Department. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  Trump expected to ask Florida Senator Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=60.04s)]
*  Rubio is currently the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=64.6s)]
*  He's also in foreign affairs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=67.88s)]
*  He's received a lot of attention in recent months as he's called for the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=69.32s)]
*  to do more to show its support for Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Iran is constantly looking to hurt Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=76.12s)]
*  They seek to drive America out of the region and then destroy Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=78.92s)]
*  This is a group that wants to destroy Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=82.52s)]
*  Hamas exists to destroy the Jewish state of Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=84.36s)]
*  What are you supposed to do with an existential threat? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=87.24s)]
*  You have to degrade it or eliminate it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=89.24s)]
*  I expect that they will respond. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=91.0s)]
*  I don't think they're going to ask us nor do they need us to help them in that regard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=92.44s)]
*  Trump has also chosen Florida Congressman Michael Waltz, an army veteran, to serve as his [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=97.72s)]
*  national security advisor. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=101.72s)]
*  A major question for the incoming administration is how it handles Ukraine going forward in its [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  ongoing war with Russia. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  Waltz talked to Fox when he was in Ukraine a few years ago and he said there should be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=109.96s)]
*  limits on what kind of support the U.S. has when it comes to providing support for Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  I don't think anybody's advocating for any military on the front line, but helping with [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=119.24s)]
*  that logistics planning, those operations, integrating the intelligence is incredibly important. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  Today Israel's president is going to be in Washington meeting with a number of lawmakers, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=131.0s)]
*  including the new nominee for UN ambassador Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=134.2s)]
*  We're looking to see whether or not Trump comments on these new posts for his administration [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=138.44s)]
*  online on social media. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=144.2s)]
*  We don't expect to see him on camera as of right now today, but we're going to see a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=145.4s)]
*  lot of him tomorrow as he makes his way to Washington for that high profile meeting with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=148.6s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=152.68s)]
*  Melania Trump is not expected to make the trip. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=153.88s)]
*  Steve Ainsley, Brian Lawrence, good morning friends. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=156.28s)]
*  Mark, do you have any idea why? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=159.16s)]
*  Because the New York Post has a story that Melania, they have a source close to Melania [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=160.76s)]
*  saying she is, Jill Biden is in someone Melania needs to meet. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=165.0s)]
*  Have you heard anything like that or could it just be a scheduling conflict? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=168.76s)]
*  We've heard both things to be completely honest with you, Brian. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=174.12s)]
*  As we've heard mixed messages. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=176.12s)]
*  I've heard one about the scheduling conflict. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=178.12s)]
*  I've heard that there's maybe some bad blood between the two. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=179.8s)]
*  Obviously there's going to be a lot of people speculating as to what kind of relationship [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=183.56s)]
*  they'll have in these 73 days left, but no official word yet from the soon to be first lady. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=187.4s)]
*  She wrote about it in her book. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=194.04s)]
*  She wrote about how the Obamas were not welcoming, didn't allow her in to come in and see the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=195.24s)]
*  grounds until the very last minute. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=200.2s)]
*  Normally that doesn't happen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=203.0s)]
*  Normally the new first lady will come in and look around and pick the furniture that they [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=204.2s)]
*  want and that kind of thing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=207.96s)]
*  And the Obamas didn't allow that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=209.16s)]
*  I don't know because Joe Biden was the vice president at the time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=210.84s)]
*  Maybe Jill Biden was a part of that too. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=213.16s)]
*  Well, but he could be the raid on the house. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=215.72s)]
*  I've heard some speculation on that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=218.52s)]
*  Well, and also if I could go ahead. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=220.04s)]
*  The other point here is that they don't really need the tour. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  They've already lived there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=225.96s)]
*  So they already know what the curtains are. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=231.56s)]
*  They know where they're going to want the TV. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=232.12s)]
*  They don't need to measure the drapes because they used to have the drapes and they know [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=233.72000000000003s)]
*  where the drapes go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=237.72000000000003s)]
*  She talked about in the book how the Obama girls had pink in their rooms and the colors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=238.52s)]
*  Barron was young. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=243.72000000000003s)]
*  Barron wanted a boy room and so she wanted to go in and prepare all of that for her son [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=244.84s)]
*  for a smooth transition that wasn't able to happen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, they had a soccer goal in the backyard because Barron wanted to shoot. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=252.36s)]
*  Wasn't that like in the Rose Garden? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=255.8s)]
*  Yeah, I could see it on the Christmas party. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=257.08s)]
*  I hope during this administration, Donald Trump becomes the first president [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=259.64s)]
*  to install a pickleball court at the White House. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=264.04s)]
*  Nice. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  They got a tennis court. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=268.6s)]
*  Mr. President, just you can you can tape it off. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=270.12s)]
*  We'll be there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=273.48s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo0-blnOXg&t=274.44s)]
