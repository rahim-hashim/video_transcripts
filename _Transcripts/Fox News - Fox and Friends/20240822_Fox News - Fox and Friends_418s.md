# Lawrence Jones: This is not normal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg)
*  Well, while Democrats descend on Chicago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=0.0s)]
*  where Lawrence is, the city's crime crisis [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=2.36s)]
*  continues to run rampant, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=4.96s)]
*  with 27 people shot, six fatally, since Monday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=6.96s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=11.8s)]
*  The families of victims impacted over the years [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=13.24s)]
*  tell me their leaders need to do better. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=15.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=18.18s)]
*  My name is Patricia Scurry. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=19.88s)]
*  My daughter's name was Kiara Scurry. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=22.04s)]
*  She was killed in June of 23. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=23.96s)]
*  She was with friends, and they were partying, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  and she took an ecstasy pill, and it was laced with fentanyl. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=29.24s)]
*  My name is Gialante Collins. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=33.18s)]
*  I was 27 when my father got murdered, and he was 55. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=35.76s)]
*  My name is Shannette Ringo. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=40.2s)]
*  My son is Ledevra West Ringo, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=42.7s)]
*  and he was killed February of 2024. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  My other son is Navajay Ringo, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=49.44s)]
*  and he was killed in June of 2017. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=52.68s)]
*  Tell me about how you lost your first son. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=56.14s)]
*  That started from an argument. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  I heard the shooting, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=61.66s)]
*  but I didn't think it didn't register [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=63.7s)]
*  until I was like, the kids is outside, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=66.0s)]
*  because usually when I hear gunshots, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=68.2s)]
*  the first thing I think is the kids outside, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=69.74s)]
*  and when I get outside, he was shot. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=72.42s)]
*  Did you hear gunshots a lot? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=74.74s)]
*  I done been all over Chicago so many years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=76.68s)]
*  You recently just lost another son. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  His killers are 16 and 13 years of age. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=81.48s)]
*  I heard the gunshots in the house. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=86.1s)]
*  My son was killed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=88.48s)]
*  My 14-year-old godson was killed, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=90.34s)]
*  and my son-in-law was killed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=93.34s)]
*  All three the same day? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=95.42s)]
*  All three of them was killed in my house. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=96.68s)]
*  So we got two issues here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=99.22s)]
*  We have the drugs that are in our community [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=100.52s)]
*  that are laced with fentanyl, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=104.0s)]
*  and we have the violence that continues to happen [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=106.06s)]
*  in our community. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=109.2s)]
*  Do you think our leaders are doing a great job [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=111.76s)]
*  to solve this crisis? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=114.0s)]
*  I believe at this point it's become the norm. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=116.26s)]
*  You know, people are so used to hearing about gun violence [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=119.02s)]
*  and drugs and drug overdoses and things of that nature. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=122.42s)]
*  It's really sad. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=126.26s)]
*  Do you think they care, though, on a day-to-day basis? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=127.44s)]
*  I think they care to a certain extent. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=129.76s)]
*  They would care more if they was here, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  what's happening to theirs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=135.5s)]
*  I know, like, the leaders is nothing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=137.18s)]
*  Jim Foxx, ugh. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=139.62s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the... [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=141.12s)]
*  My first instance. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=142.84s)]
*  The states attorney, she was not playing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=144.4s)]
*  She didn't want no plea agreements, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  no bargains, no nothing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=149.1s)]
*  We get all the evidence, all the evidence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=150.72s)]
*  But it's different now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=152.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=154.38s)]
*  Because, you know, what Jim Foxx told me, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  that Jesse Smollett's case was a high-profile case, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  and it was more important than my son's case. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  And she took the people off of my son's case [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=163.4s)]
*  and put them on a Jesse Smollett's case [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  because the young man who killed my son, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=168.12s)]
*  they gave him a plea agreement. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=169.94s)]
*  There's a big convention happening right now, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=171.7s)]
*  the Democratic National Convention. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=173.8s)]
*  How does it make you feel that they decide to step up [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=175.82000000000002s)]
*  to security and enforcement for one week? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  It's just for them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=182.16s)]
*  When they leave, they'll be gone. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=183.66s)]
*  Can we afford to continue to vote for the same people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=185.3s)]
*  if this is how it's gonna be? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=188.08s)]
*  I'm a Democrat, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=189.74s)]
*  But I don't think I want to vote for Kamala [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=191.44s)]
*  just like that even. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  And I'm a Democrat. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like she has released a plan [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=197.68s)]
*  to fix the community or anything like that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=200.18s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  I feel like she hasn't spoken about things [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=204.22s)]
*  that she wants to do as far as making it better. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=209.18s)]
*  What would be your message to the leaders [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=212.08s)]
*  in the Democratic Party? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  To actually do something for the community [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=216.32s)]
*  and not just speak on it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  An eight-year-old lost his mom. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=220.66s)]
*  I lost my daughter prematurely. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=222.8s)]
*  So I would actually, you know, ask her to stuff her game up [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  and please do more to keep these criminals, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=228.4s)]
*  these drug dealers and people that shoot guns off the streets. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=231.56s)]
*  Get them off the street and keep them off the streets. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  They don't know what this pain is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  Until they have to go through that, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=239.16s)]
*  we'll always be a black and white. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=245.2s)]
*  She gonna be a number and I'm gonna be a number. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=247.88s)]
*  And that's not fair. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's a general theme, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  whether it was the victims that we had early on the week [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=257.28s)]
*  or these families that we're talking to, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=261.02s)]
*  that their kids are just numbers, that it's been normalized. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=262.8s)]
*  We get the headlines every week where it's five people killed. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  That's not normal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=268.04s)]
*  In a civil society in America, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=269.7s)]
*  that five people are just killed over the weekend, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=272.18s)]
*  but it's become the norm in Chicago, guys. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=274.28s)]
*  Hey, Lawrence, I'd love to ask you, you know, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=276.68s)]
*  the promises and the failed promises of the Democratic Party [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=278.5s)]
*  for the black community is a half a century project [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=283.14s)]
*  and yet continues to win the vote of the black community. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=286.52s)]
*  As you sit there and you talk to those people in Chicago [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=289.36s)]
*  and they lay out to you not just their problems [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=291.8s)]
*  but their lives like this, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=293.32s)]
*  what could any politician come in and do? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=295.06s)]
*  Like literally do, not promise, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=297.94s)]
*  but say the young man that said to you, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=300.04s)]
*  I'm a Democrat, but I'm not gonna vote for them [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=301.6s)]
*  because they're not actually doing anything for the community. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=304.54s)]
*  What do they want done for the community? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=306.98s)]
*  Well, I think they want the pain to end. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=310.94s)]
*  And I think, you know, there's been this narrative [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=313.12s)]
*  that the people within the community are anti-police. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=315.48s)]
*  They're anti-corruption. They're not anti-cop. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=318.92s)]
*  And I think if any candidate, first of all, Will, to your point, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=321.48s)]
*  and we heard this in the barbershop yesterday, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=325.48s)]
*  they want to see the candidates as well. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=327.28s)]
*  There is this notion within black America, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  especially in the community, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=332.06s)]
*  that the Republicans don't get them because they don't see them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=333.46s)]
*  And I do think there is some truth to that critique. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=336.52s)]
*  When you don't see someone, you don't know who they are. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=339.7s)]
*  You don't speak the same language. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=341.6s)]
*  But because deep down in the core of black America, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=343.28s)]
*  the value system is pretty much conservative. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  It's just not transitioned when it comes to the voting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=349.24s)]
*  So I think if they saw politicians say, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  look, I'm gonna be anti-corruption. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=355.68s)]
*  I'm gonna make sure that you have good cops [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  that walk the beat every single day in your community [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=359.28s)]
*  and keep your family safe, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=361.68s)]
*  bring jobs back to your community, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  have a message of school choice. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't mean just the talking point of school choice, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=367.12s)]
*  but exactly what the school choice mean, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=369.26s)]
*  meaning you don't have to go to a failing school [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=372.5s)]
*  and your zip code, your kids deserve better. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  They deserve to read. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=377.2s)]
*  I think if they present that message, there's a real shot. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=379.56s)]
*  And the money follows the kids. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=382.64s)]
*  And you get a YMCA in these areas, too. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=383.94s)]
*  You provide security, you provide outlets, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=387.0s)]
*  and you increase the school competition, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=390.2s)]
*  allow them to go elsewhere for failing schools. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  That will be a great foundation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  It shouldn't be the norm that this mom says, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  every time I hear a gunshot, I think of my children. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=397.94s)]
*  That's a regular thing in her neighborhood. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=401.38s)]
*  And there's a lot of people who never hear a gunshot [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=403.44s)]
*  in this country. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=405.76s)]
*  Good job, Lawrence. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtdvkHxq-kg&t=407.18s)]
