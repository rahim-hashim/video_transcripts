# SHOCKING admission triggers new wave of criticism
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg)
*  Let's talk about something else that I find absolutely stunning and that as I think we have now the third book [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=0.0s)]
*  Tell-all book about what took place over the last four years with the Biden administration and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=5.48s)]
*  Judging by what we're seeing now from the Alex Thompson Jake Ptaper book and we'll talk about the co-authors in a second [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=10.84s)]
*  Is this is even worse than I thought? Yeah. Here's a quote from the book for months [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=16.36s)]
*  We didn't have access to him talking about Joe Biden [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=21.76s)]
*  There was clearly a deliberate strategy by the White House to have him meet with as few people as necessary [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=24.4s)]
*  This is a cabinet secretary. So I want to take y'all back to a moment. Y'all remember doing the DNC [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  I was down there covering it for our show and I interviewed Pete Buttigieg's and I asked him about this [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=37.32s)]
*  I asked him about the the cabinet meetings and the fact that Jill Biden was coordinate and he pushed back [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=44.0s)]
*  He got very indignant about it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=49.84s)]
*  He said it was not true and now we're learning these people still don't want to put their names on it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=52.18s)]
*  This is a cabinet member that still doesn't want to tell the truth to the American people say yeah, I witnessed that they're still unnamed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=57.3s)]
*  I mean for example one cabinet secretary said the the top a shielded him from every meeting the cabinet was kept at bay [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=64.89999999999999s)]
*  I also says at one rare moment during the meeting the cabinet secretary was shocked by how the president was acting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=72.9s)]
*  He seemed disoriented his man he was out of it his mouth was agape [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=79.16s)]
*  And I'm just gonna say this the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was General Milley [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=83.8s)]
*  He had no problem calling up China and reporting on our president [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=87.52s)]
*  He had no problem Trump at the time Trump at the time and turning on President Trump [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=91.22s)]
*  But he watched the guy basically catatonic refusing to get cabinet meetings have the worst military decisions in our history [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  And he kept his mouth shut entirely a little bit of politics [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=103.24s)]
*  It also says that the cabinet they lacked confidence in him in the last year according to this book [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=107.06s)]
*  They they based this book on 200 different interviews mostly Democratic insiders [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=111.74s)]
*  But if they knew that they weren't confident in the president [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=116.38s)]
*  Why didn't anyone say anything until after that disastrous debate? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=119.66s)]
*  They didn't tell the country they didn't propose the 25th Amendment in private and many of them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=123.1s)]
*  I'm sorry. They want to run for governor or president now. It's a disqualifier [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  They should be asked in every single interview that they do. What did you know? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=135.02s)]
*  When did you know it and is this true? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=139.24s)]
*  And that that's why if you want the American people to trust you again [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=141.58s)]
*  You have to come to Jesus with this worry and stop saying I want to look forward [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=145.10000000000002s)]
*  Jake Tapper who ignored this story virtually his entire tenure from the time [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=149.86s)]
*  He ran in 2020 through the end wants to make money off it now listen. I [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=155.08s)]
*  Think some of the criticism is fair to be honest of me [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  Certainly, I'm not gonna speak for anybody else but knowing then what I know now [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=165.5s)]
*  I look back at my coverage during the Biden years and I did cover some of these issues, but not enough [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=169.78s)]
*  I look back on it with humility [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=176.74s)]
*  So basically admitting that he didn't cover it the way he should have and now he wants to make money on it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=180.78s)]
*  Ainsley, this is what bothers me about that statement [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=186.86s)]
*  You chose to look the other way. That's right [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  You you chose to run with things like the Russian hoax and get awards for it [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=191.9s)]
*  You chose to go with the story one from Adam Schiff was giving you leads that didn't exist [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=196.3s)]
*  You chose to look at the steel report as ironclad like your Bible [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=201.22s)]
*  You chose to go with that and gum up the country for two and a half years and that Donald Trump was never president [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=205.34s)]
*  But you chose not to look at what we all saw a guy that couldn't walk couldn't talk [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=211.26s)]
*  Wouldn't have cabinet meetings his decisions was so horrific at Afghanistan [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=217.38s)]
*  You stopped showing the video of them falling off planes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=221.94s)]
*  You watched the testimony of the generals who said I told him not to leave this way with this troop threshold [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=224.74s)]
*  And you chose not to say wait a second [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=230.46s)]
*  Can this guy even think you chose to see the story about note cards about where to walk and where to sit with one? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=232.98s)]
*  Empty chair in a room and you didn't think you could just focus on that in your two-hour show [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=239.46s)]
*  They are still denying this is their defense this is the media's new defense [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=244.18s)]
*  they said [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=249.3s)]
*  It's not that they weren't reporting on it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=251.1s)]
*  It's that the White House lied to them and that they could not see it [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's the reason all of us could see the American people could see it and suddenly we're so supposed to believe that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=256.74s)]
*  They had blinders on and they they had more access to the president than we did. I'm just not buying it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=262.98s)]
*  well, then you have [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=269.22s)]
*  Clooney George Clooney who said he was at the fundraiser that he was hosting for his 20-year friend for 20 years and he couldn't even remember [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=270.82000000000005s)]
*  His name his national security adviser that briefs them every day. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian kill me [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iAzaCxjuLg&t=277.1s)]
