# 'TOTALLY SHAMELESS': Hilton slams Newsom over ICE raid condemnation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs)
*  Gavin Newsom condemning the ICE raids sweeping through his state as protesters square off with federal agents in Los Angeles [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=0.0s)]
*  Newsom saying this [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=8.24s)]
*  Continued chaotic federal sweeps across California to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=9.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's chaos is eroding trust tearing families apart and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=16.48s)]
*  Unreminding the workers and industries that power America's economy here to discuss it is California gubernatorial candidate Steve Hill and I [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Mean Steve [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Condemning the administration for trying to keep Americans safe including Californians. I mean, what's that about? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  It's totally shameless isn't it but we used to that from Gavin Newsom, you know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=38.64s)]
*  What's chaotic an open border where millions of people just flood into the country year after year including dangerous criminals and terrorists [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=42.9s)]
*  You know what's chaotic what you've seen in California for years [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=50.9s)]
*  Which is total lack of law enforcement of upholding the law whether that's homeless people on the streets [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=55.02s)]
*  criminals on the streets and what's chaotic is just standing by all the authorities in LA yesterday issuing pathetic [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=61.54s)]
*  pandering statements instead of standing with federal law enforcement to make sure that this is done properly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=69.66s)]
*  That's chaotic. Yeah, I think was he asleep during the past election when it was the second most important issue to voters [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=76.82s)]
*  You know Steve you're running for governor in California. I've got to get you on this as well. So governor Gavin Newsom [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=82.9s)]
*  He's floating the idea that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=88.22s)]
*  Californians should not pay federal taxes as the White House push backs, you know threatening to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=90.22s)]
*  Prepare large-scale cancellations of federal funding for this state. So, you know, you're running for governor [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  So where do you stand in this standoff between the federal government in California? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=103.54s)]
*  So, let's look at what caused this it was Gavin Newsom [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=108.34s)]
*  Refusing to act on what he said was deeply unfair, which is biological men in girls sports [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=112.62s)]
*  President Trump quite correctly said this is wrong and it shouldn't happen and he's issued a very clear executive order [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=120.14s)]
*  Saying it shouldn't happen and yet Gavin Newsom has done nothing about it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=128.02s)]
*  Nothing about it, even though he said it's unfair a majority of Californians say that it's wrong [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  I a week ago [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=139.62s)]
*  I went to the track and field finals in Fresno County [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=141.34s)]
*  To stand there with female athletes and said when I'm governor [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=145.86s)]
*  This will stop because actually the law that enables this in California violates the California [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  Constitution and so if they don't change it, I will file a suit to overturn it [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=157.1s)]
*  Gavin Newsom could do that today [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  He could do it right now and then all this problem would go away [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=165.18s)]
*  But as usual he says one thing and does another or does nothing at all [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=168.62s)]
*  Well in California's experienced a mass exodus of people [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=173.34s)]
*  And also a mass exodus of movie and television production from the Golden State as well [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=177.3s)]
*  Gavin Newsom has held some meetings with the ambassadors that President Trump has named to Hollywood [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  Why are we seeing this mass exodus from television production from the state of California Steve? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=188.78s)]
*  You've had 15 years now Lisa of one party rule by the Democrats and their insane policies have made everything more [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=195.42s)]
*  Expensive everything housing rent gas electricity you name it and that is one of the main reasons [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=203.42s)]
*  That this industry is leaving you just had a report saying that that Los Angeles could become the next Detroit [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  Because the entertainment industry is leaving on top of that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=215.9s)]
*  You've got the unions the right to strike all of it enabled by the Democrats. We've got to make California affordable again [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=219.22s)]
*  That's why this week [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  I launched my plan for three dollar gas in California three dollar gas instead of what you're getting with Gavin Newsom [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=227.42s)]
*  We could have eight dollar gas in California next year [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  So every single thing they're doing is making it impossible to live here to run a business here [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=237.86s)]
*  That's why we need change in California Steve. I gotta say I miss you here at Fox News [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=243.58s)]
*  You're such a great friend, but it's great to see you out there and stepping up and doing something so important running for governor [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=248.38000000000002s)]
*  So great to see you my friend on this Saturday morning. Take care and you see you soon. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDuFccGdEQs&t=254.4s)]
