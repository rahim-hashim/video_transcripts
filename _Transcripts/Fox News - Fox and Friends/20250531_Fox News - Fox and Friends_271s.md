# Trump made a ‘smart call’ on this: Venezuelan opposition leader
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8)
*  Joining us now is Venezuelan opposition leader, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=0.0s)]
*  Maria Corina Machado, the bravest woman in Latin America. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  We're so happy to have you, Maria, on the show. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=6.04s)]
*  So let's start with this Chevron deal that Donald Trump made. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=8.28s)]
*  He basically said, you can't produce, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=12.44s)]
*  you can't have operations there, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=14.52s)]
*  but we're gonna allow you to have an office [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=16.12s)]
*  so that you can have operations in the future [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  when we have better relations with Venezuela [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=22.12s)]
*  and also so that Maduro can't seize your assets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=28.24s)]
*  Was this the right compromise? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely, Rachel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=31.96s)]
*  And we are very grateful to President Trump [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=33.16s)]
*  or for his own wavering support [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=35.88s)]
*  to democracy and freedom in our country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=37.8s)]
*  And this was certainly a smart call [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=40.08s)]
*  because on one hand it protects energy assets [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=43.04s)]
*  of the US in Venezuela, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=45.8s)]
*  but it doesn't give a communist dictator as Maduro [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=47.44s)]
*  a penny that he would use to repress [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=52.64s)]
*  for repression, terror, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=56.48s)]
*  and even for expanding the activities in the drug cartels. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=58.4s)]
*  At the same time, as you say, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=62.16s)]
*  this position US companies in a great level [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=64.16s)]
*  to lead investment and operation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=69.2s)]
*  once we bring back democracy and freedom to Venezuela. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=72.8s)]
*  Yeah, and that's been your message to Chevron, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=77.84s)]
*  You've been like, hey, listen, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=79.64s)]
*  I understand you're upset about this, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=80.8s)]
*  but things will be actually more profitable for you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=82.44s)]
*  if we see this government out, correct? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=85.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=90.08s)]
*  Right now, every company that operates in Venezuela [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=91.0s)]
*  is forced to partner not only with a dictator, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=93.88s)]
*  but with the criminal head, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  the head of a criminal enterprise [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  that is also the head of the Tren de Agua [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=102.08s)]
*  and Cartel de los Soles. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=104.8s)]
*  And they operate without transparency, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=106.35999999999999s)]
*  no rule of law, no open markets. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=108.6s)]
*  On the contrary, once Venezuela is free, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=111.6s)]
*  we will open markets, we will have rule of law, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=114.56s)]
*  we will protect private property, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  and we will be a secure and reliable partner [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  and not only in energy, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=123.56s)]
*  but also to create a firewall for security in the region [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=124.96s)]
*  and against Russian and Chinese influence in the hemisphere. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=129.76s)]
*  Maria, I wanna talk about what's next [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=133.88s)]
*  because we saw a couple of weeks ago, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=135.96s)]
*  there were some opposition leaders, partners of yours, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=137.84s)]
*  in the opposition to Nicolas Maduro, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  they were holed up for a year inside of an embassy, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  the Argentine embassy, and the US helped them escape. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=147.72s)]
*  They're now on US soil at Fox Noticias. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=150.76s)]
*  We've interviewed some of them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=153.0s)]
*  But now what's next for Maduro? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  You say that that was a sign that he is weak. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=157.32s)]
*  Are we actually looking at a new period of time [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=159.56s)]
*  in this whole ordeal, this whole saga? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=162.2s)]
*  Is it time that, is he so weak that he may be deposed? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  Will he get a deal from Trump to just leave? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=168.64s)]
*  What will happen? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=170.72s)]
*  What's next for you? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=171.96s)]
*  What's next for Venezuela and Maduro? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=172.8s)]
*  What you're saying is absolutely true. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=175.76s)]
*  So the first time we have all vectors aligned [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=178.64s)]
*  for democratic and order transition in Venezuela. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=181.72s)]
*  This decision to cut funding [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=186.0s)]
*  creates great distress within the regime. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=189.16s)]
*  We already seen signs of it, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  of fractures and confrontations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=195.04s)]
*  These decisions should be enforced. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=197.4s)]
*  President Trump has talked about secondary sanctions [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=200.36s)]
*  already in place, but also found flows [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  that come from drug trafficking weapons [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  and gold trafficking should be blocked. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=209.72000000000003s)]
*  This is a way to go law enforcement. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  And believe me, the regime is weaker than ever. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  As Operacion Guacamaya, which you mentioned, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=218.84s)]
*  the rescue mission supported by the US demonstrated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  We the Venezuelan people are committed to be free. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=225.2s)]
*  We're working, we're fighting. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=228.92s)]
*  And Venezuela will be a great partner of the US very soon. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=230.88s)]
*  Well, Maria, he's weak. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=236.2s)]
*  You won the last, your opposition party won by over 70%. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=237.96s)]
*  Venezuela is behind you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=241.8s)]
*  We'll see what happens next. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qmalNgqnc8&t=243.2s)]
