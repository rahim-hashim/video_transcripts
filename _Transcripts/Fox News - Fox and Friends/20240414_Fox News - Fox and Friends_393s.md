# Biden’s weakness could cause WWIII: Former Trump official
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc)
*  I want to say God bless the people of Israel. They're under attack right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's that's because we show great weakness. It would not happen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=5.0s)]
*  The weakness that we've shown is unbelievable. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=9.84s)]
*  And it would not have happened if we were in office. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=13.76s)]
*  You know that they know that everybody knows that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  But America prays for Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  We send our absolute support to everyone in harm's way. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=20.72s)]
*  President Trump sounding off on America's standing on the world stage [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  as Iran launches a major attack against America's best ally in the Middle East, Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=29.08s)]
*  Joining us now with more Trump 2024 National Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Carolyn, it's great to have you here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  That was it was a really interesting moment for the president to showcase [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=41.6s)]
*  what he would have done, what would not have happened had he been president. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=45.56s)]
*  The crowd seems to be eating it up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=50.32s)]
*  But tell us more about what his thoughts are on this particular [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=52.0s)]
*  very dangerous situation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=56.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, President Trump was made aware of the attack on Israel last night [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=58.12s)]
*  on our way to his rally in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=61.8s)]
*  And he made it a priority to ensure that those remarks were at the top of his speech [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=64.04s)]
*  to express 100 percent support for Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=68.48s)]
*  And as he expressed last night in Pennsylvania to a massive crowd of people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=72.2s)]
*  that were on their feet clapping and cheering, is that the sad truth is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=76.2s)]
*  this would have never happened to Israel if President Trump were still in the White House. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=80.6s)]
*  Just a few years ago, there was peace in the Middle East. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  President Trump got Arab nations to come to the table to negotiate peace deals [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=87.32s)]
*  with Israel that never spoke before he was the negotiator in chief. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  He signed historic sanctions on the Iranian regime, cutting off the neck of the Iranians. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  They had never been more weak, more broke. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=100.16s)]
*  And just in a matter of a few years, Joe Biden has reversed all of President Trump's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=102.16s)]
*  very effective policies, and now they have been emboldened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=106.28s)]
*  And we've seen that aggression. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  The world is in chaos right now because of Joe Biden's weakness. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  And it just shows how petty and ridiculous this trial that we have starting in New York is tomorrow. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=115.92s)]
*  When the world is at war, when our border is under invasion by terrorists and criminals, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  when inflation is increasing, the Democrats and Joe Biden are focused on prosecuting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=126.92s)]
*  the former president of the United States. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=131.12s)]
*  We're going to get to that trial in just one moment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=132.88s)]
*  But how do you reverse that reversal? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=134.44s)]
*  So so the president were to win. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=136.4s)]
*  How do you put the chaos back in the bottle in the Middle East? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=139.12s)]
*  It starts on day one when President Trump walks into the Oval Office. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  The world is going to know that we have a strong commander in chief that is going to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  put America first, that is going to lead through an approach of peace through strength. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=149.6s)]
*  He will slap sanctions back on the Iranian regime. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=154.72s)]
*  A bloodthirsty terrorist in the Middle East like Soleimani will once again be gunned down. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine will end. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=162.6s)]
*  President Trump has promised to end that war in 24 hours. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  And China will no longer be promising to take Taiwan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=167.6s)]
*  Our adversaries will be deterred just by the fact that we will have a strong commander [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  in chief and a rebuilding of our military like we saw in President Trump's first term. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=174.76s)]
*  Well, the nation traded away, you know, low inflation and world peace for no more mean [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  tweets. Yeah, I know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=183.76s)]
*  They're happy with their trade. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=185.48s)]
*  Let's get to the trial because your point is well taken that this is what will commandeer [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  much of President Trump's, if not attention, his time over the coming week. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=192.2s)]
*  He said the other night that he will testify. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=196.44s)]
*  I'm sure his attorneys will also provide feedback on whether or not that will be the case. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=198.56s)]
*  But what do you expect this week from President Trump? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=202.36s)]
*  We expect him to fight for truth like he always does. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=205.24s)]
*  And what is taking place in this city this week is a travesty of justice. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=208.56s)]
*  It's an unprecedented time in which we have the sitting president of the United States [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=212.88s)]
*  and Joe Biden weaponizing the justice system against his political opponent. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  This is what happens in third world banana republics. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  Not here in the United States of America. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=224.0s)]
*  And this case is a Biden trial at the behest of a far left district attorney in Alvin [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  Bragg, who has spent more time prosecuting President Trump than the violent criminals who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=232.0s)]
*  are running free in the streets of New York right now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=235.96s)]
*  And the case is being overseen by a partisan judge. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  Judge Martian is a partisan Democrat. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=241.28s)]
*  He has donated money to Joe Biden's campaign. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  How can you honestly oversee a trial against a presidential candidate when you yourself [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  support that candidate's opposition? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  It is election interference and the American people see that President Trump will continue [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=253.88s)]
*  to fight for truth. Now, they don't want him to do that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=259.0s)]
*  They're politically persecuting him and then they're also gagging him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=261.2s)]
*  They want to take away his First Amendment right because they know he exposes the truth [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  about the corruption and the corrupt actors who are leading this case. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=268.32s)]
*  And it starts with Joe Biden. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=271.72s)]
*  Yeah, it is election interference. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=273.08s)]
*  I think the American people see that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=274.36s)]
*  What I think is interesting is that I'm watching him on the screen right here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  Strong coming up to the stage, making a strong statement. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=279.56s)]
*  On the situation with Israel and Iran. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=283.32s)]
*  And I think about Joe Biden. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=286.24s)]
*  Like, could Joe Biden with the trial looming [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=287.68s)]
*  and all the persecution that Donald Trump is facing and what he has to prepare for [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=291.32s)]
*  the next day, could he handle a late night rally like this? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=295.92s)]
*  I mean, it's really there's so many issues that what you brought up, Will. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=300.24s)]
*  But there are so many ways that we can see one president versus the other, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=303.88s)]
*  including the economy only four years ago. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=310.2s)]
*  Record breaking. That's right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=313.04s)]
*  The Americans have never had a stronger [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  contrast than the one they will have on the ballot before them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=316.2s)]
*  On November the 5th, we had a secure border. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=319.16s)]
*  Now we have a wide open border. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=321.36s)]
*  We had peace around the world that we have chaos. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=322.56s)]
*  We are on the brink of World War Three because of Joe Biden's weakness. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=324.72s)]
*  And this trial this week and in the coming weeks is going to backfire on the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=328.12s)]
*  Democrats, just like all of the Biden trials have. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=332.24s)]
*  Our campaign has never been stronger. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=334.64s)]
*  President Trump has never been in a stronger position to win. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=336.56s)]
*  He is tough. He is tenacious. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=339.56s)]
*  We will continue to fight for truth in the courtroom and to win the votes of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  Americans on the campaign trail. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  And they want to confine him to a courtroom. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=346.67999999999995s)]
*  But unfortunately for them, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  President Trump has a big, beautiful plane that we will continue to use to fly [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  around this country and earn votes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  He has the power of truth social to spread truth to the American public. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=355.08s)]
*  Our fundraising is exploding. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  And when you go to rallies like the one we did in Pennsylvania last night, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  there has never been more energy, more spirit, more love from the grassroots [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  voters of this great country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=368.84s)]
*  So we'll continue to fight every step of the way. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=370.2s)]
*  Yeah. And to your point, Rachel, last night, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  there was only one president that gave a live statement and it wasn't Joe Biden. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=374.28s)]
*  We're still waiting to hear from Biden. Exactly. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiqDoUgBkkc&t=378.67999999999995s)]
