# Migrant accused of shocking act hours before liberal gov touts subway safety
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ)
*  A Fox News alert right now NYPD sources tell us an illegal immigrant is in custody after allegedly setting fire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes setting fire to a woman in a New York City subway. We must warn you this video is graphic [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=7.5s)]
*  We're gonna show you once so you know what we're talking about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=12.84s)]
*  the NYPD accusing him of approaching a woman sleeping on a stationary train and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=16.5s)]
*  Lighting her clothes on fire with a lighter earlier yesterday before sitting on a bench and watching her burn to death [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=21.3s)]
*  Our next guest was just in New York City earlier this month meeting with mayor Adams about the illegal immigrant crisis [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=29.3s)]
*  Incoming borders are Tom Holman Tom. I know you were in Phoenix. You were caught up in in the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=35.42s)]
*  In the big speech yesterday and the president's first extensive remarks about his agenda, but from what I just told you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=41.78s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  Well, look, this is another example of an illegal island killing American citizens almost a daily occurrence now [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  You know because historic number of criminal aliens walk in the streets because this administration's policy and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=55.74s)]
*  Sanctuary jurisdictions and lacks immigration enforcement ice has their hands tied [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=62.54s)]
*  Secretary my orcas have given them priorities that they can't even go arrest an illegal alien anymore unless he's convicted [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=67.82s)]
*  Convicted of a serious crime then maybe they can arrest him. So this is on this administration as far as governor Hoco [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  Shame on her. She supports sanctuary status in that state [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=80.34s)]
*  She welcomed thousands of illegal aliens to to her state [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=83.54s)]
*  She sent into Buffalo and Syracuse murders were occurred by illegal aliens in Buffalo and Syracuse [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=87.10000000000001s)]
*  She has a green light law ice and CBP can't even work with local law enforcement [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=91.9s)]
*  Local law enforcement can't even share DMV data with these people. So governor Hoco shame on you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=95.98s)]
*  There's nothing you can say that's gonna make this right in New York [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  All right [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=103.54s)]
*  You didn't get a chance to see secretary may orcas in his exit interview on CBS [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=103.94000000000001s)]
*  Talked about how proud he is that the border is down to 50,000. So though the problems virtually solved [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=108.42s)]
*  Here's what he said though when pressed by Margaret Brennan about how he loses track of children watch [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=115.22s)]
*  We certainly have received reports of children being trafficked [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=122.02s)]
*  even those [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=127.9s)]
*  As to whom we know where they are that is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=129.3s)]
*  Of course we investigate cases of of trafficking but there are children [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=135.58s)]
*  who are [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=143.78s)]
*  reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian and they move and sometimes the government [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=145.58s)]
*  Loses track. So does that explain everything? What should I know about his statement? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=153.34s)]
*  It's nothing but lies nothing but lies border numbers aren't down [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  They're just putting them through the CBP one app and the CHNV app you add those programs together [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=162.26s)]
*  What board chose catching the gotaways? We're still had historic numbers [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=166.98s)]
*  They were bragging the other day that ice has over 247,000 removals the most in a decade [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  No, they don't if you look at the data 80% of them were board patrol apprehensions that ice just simply put across the border [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  Simply put across the border ice internal interior enforcement numbers are historic lows and as far as the children [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=181.82s)]
*  Another lie under his guidance under his leadership [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=190.1s)]
*  First of all, it's his policies that cause over half a million of children being smuggled in this country trafficking this country [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=193.5s)]
*  And they they lost track with 340,000 of them. He's just at his lips your movement [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=200.46s)]
*  He's lying and needs to be held accountable [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=206.38s)]
*  Nothing he said in that interview is truthful and the thing is Tom it's not because he's naive [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=207.98s)]
*  He knows he's not telling the truth. He worked for you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=212.02s)]
*  He was down there before and he'll go ahead and implement healing implemented these problems [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=215.22s)]
*  And these policies anyway, and he also knew who to blame [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=220.26s)]
*  Listen to this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=224.14s)]
*  Number of last year border crossings were at record highs [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=226.66s)]
*  Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=230.46s)]
*  Administration [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=233.7s)]
*  How much of that drop-off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border of the United States? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=234.9s)]
*  That is critically one element of it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=242.82s)]
*  It is not the only element of it the president took executive action in June of this year [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  That has been a key driver of the the low number of encounters at our border. We are now [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=252.42s)]
*  delivering [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=260.1s)]
*  To the incoming administration a southern border at which the number of individuals [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=261.5s)]
*  Encountered is well below the level [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=267.74s)]
*  experienced in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=270.86s)]
*  2019 the last year before the pandemic [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=272.38s)]
*  Your thoughts about this [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=276.62s)]
*  Another lie the numbers are not down like they claim they are because they've taken thousands of illegal [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=280.02s)]
*  Aliens bring them to our city straight to the airports and the CHNV at [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=285.74s)]
*  Program straight into our airports from countries same illegal alien population, but they divide them in three buckets [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=289.98s)]
*  Let's bring thousands to our airports through CHNV [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=295.74s)]
*  Let's bring thousands a day to the CBP one app and we're still catching thousands a day by the border chill [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  He's lying. They took the same illegal alien population divide them in three different buckets [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=304.42s)]
*  So the encounters are not down to historic levels [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=309.22s)]
*  Like he said and bottom line is it isn't about a number of people who deport it's about the number of people you release [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=312.16s)]
*  In this country over a million illegal aliens you release in this country and that's why we have the crime rate we have today [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=317.34s)]
*  And that's why look [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=323.28s)]
*  No one's gonna fix this whole problem president Trump's gonna fix this issue because we're going to shut the border down [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  We're gonna have the largest deportation operation this country's ever seen and we will we will find over [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=329.9s)]
*  340,000 children that you lost track of that you released the unspotted bonds unspotted unvetted sponsors many are in sex trafficking [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  Many in forced labor we will rescue those children that you traffic into United States [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=343.42s)]
*  Lastly is this is this whole thing because of worldwide? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=348.7s)]
*  Migration and they just happen to be president and he happens to be in office when this migration was just moving around the planet [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=354.46s)]
*  Look under President Trump had historic lows and illegal migration with the most secure border in a lifetime [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=363.94s)]
*  They came to office and purposely by design unsecured a border [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=370.46s)]
*  Wrote 90 executive orders abolishing everything we did to give us the most secure border in lifetime. This wasn't an accident [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=375.5s)]
*  This was his management. This was on purpose. He needs to be held accountable [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=381.46s)]
*  so the illegal immigrants [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=385.78s)]
*  Pride themselves on knowing American politics and knowing how to work it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=387.9s)]
*  I hope they're watching now and the word is if they are they will turn around and they'll go back home because they're not getting in [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=392.29999999999995s)]
*  Tom Homan, thanks so much. It was a quick turnaround and we appreciate you coming up coming on with us. I'm Steve juicy [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D97VxdfEIpQ&t=399.5s)]
