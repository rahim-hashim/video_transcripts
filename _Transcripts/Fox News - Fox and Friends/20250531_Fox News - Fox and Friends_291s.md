# Father says CA athletic director compared his daughter to a ‘nazi’ for being pro-girls’ sports
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA)
*  Today a biological male is scheduled to compete in California's high school track and field championships as the DOJ [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=0.0s)]
*  Investigates the state to determine if they violated title nine for allowing biological males to compete in women's sports [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=6.54s)]
*  Our next guest filed her own federal lawsuit after she lost her varsity cross-country spot to a trans athlete [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=14.44s)]
*  Joining us now is high school cross-country athlete Taylor Starling with her father Ryan Starling and their attorney [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=23.1s)]
*  Julianne Fleischer. Thank you all for joining us and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=30.36s)]
*  Especially you Taylor now. I want to you've obviously devoted much of your young life to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=35.68s)]
*  Running what is it like to go out and compete at something? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  You're very good at and you've really spent a lot of time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=47.64s)]
*  Becoming better at and then you wind up competing against a biological male [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=50.64s)]
*  It's just sad to see that these boys are taking girls [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=56.06s)]
*  Their fairness in sports away from them because women 50 years have fought [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  For their rights and it's being taken away by these guys that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=69.34s)]
*  Are taking away girls awards their medals. They're taking away their spots and it's just not fair [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=75.1s)]
*  And it's just so sad to see that this is what me a 16 year old girl has to fight for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=81.66s)]
*  To fight for all those women you might be 16, but you are wise beyond your years [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=87.58s)]
*  So Ryan, what's it like to be a dad and to realize that your daughter is up against all these huge [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=94.05999999999999s)]
*  Institutions that don't seem to have any problem [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=101.82s)]
*  whatsoever with this level of unfairness [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=105.1s)]
*  I couldn't be more proud. I mean a 15 and a 16 year old girl stood up and wore these shirts and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  were compared to a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=114.05999999999999s)]
*  Nazi by their athletic director and they can still continue to push forward and fight for fairness and girls sports [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=116.3s)]
*  I mean that takes courageous. I wish governor Gavin Newsom could have that much courage [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=123.06s)]
*  He recently said that this is unfair, but he just keeps giving us lip service and we're just not going to be able to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  But he just keeps giving us lip service and won't act on he has the power right now to act on this and he won't he has [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  The executive orders, but he won't and we're on the verge of losing a hundred and seventy billion dollars and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  academics money for other [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=150.3s)]
*  institutions and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=153.9s)]
*  Education in California. It's it's just crazy. There's biological boys and there's biological girls. It's fairness [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=155.94s)]
*  It's safety for these girls. It's hard to see as a dad that he's not putting safety first [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=162.7s)]
*  So Julianne, I want to ask you about what Ryan just mentioned there, you know, obviously we are getting a lot of lip service from politicians [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=168.46s)]
*  Most especially from Gavin Newsom talking about how it is indeed unfair [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=175.98s)]
*  Where what are the explain to us the legal situation in terms of where some of these cases are going? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=181.46s)]
*  Where and how they might get resolved? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=187.62s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you know what it is just as Ryan said it is lip service [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  You're either against boys being on girls sports or competing with girls or you're not you can't stay on the sideline for this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=193.7s)]
*  and with the recent DOJ [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=200.7s)]
*  Investigation that's huge and for months now both CIF the state of California [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=203.82s)]
*  The governor have been on notice that what they're doing is they're violating federal law [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=210.1s)]
*  They're violating the executive orders that this administration has put forth [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=215.14s)]
*  They're violating the protections that are afforded by Title IX [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=220.1s)]
*  And so the Department of Justice is is letting the state know that they're on notice [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=223.82s)]
*  just this week the Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=229.66s)]
*  Taylor's lawsuit in which we're suing the state of California for its Title IX violations and the Department of Justice [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=234.7s)]
*  filed the statement of interest and said [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  We have an [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=243.38s)]
*  invested interest in this boys do not belong in girls sports and so [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  You know just as Ryan said government the governor has the authority to take action [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  But he's choosing to stay on the sideline and and that's not acceptable, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=254.66s)]
*  Well, just to be clear we reach out to Taylor Starling School District Riverside, you know [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=258.34s)]
*  Unified and for a statement on this and they have failed to get back [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=262.94s)]
*  And if they do we'll let you know [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=268.3s)]
*  Taylor Ryan and Julianne, thank you so much [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=271.02000000000004s)]
*  But especially you Taylor and good luck with the track meet and going forward. You're a wise young lady [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFVgD3pbKA&t=273.38s)]
