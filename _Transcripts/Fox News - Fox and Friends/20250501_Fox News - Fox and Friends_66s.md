# 'FANTASTIC GUY': President Trump congratulates our very own Steve Doocy on his big announcement
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI)
*  Hi Steve, it's your all-time favorite president and I just want to congratulate you on your new and probably enhanced role. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=0.0s)]
*  I just think you're a fantastic guy. You've always treated me fairly. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Sometimes a little more fairly than other times, but that's okay. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=12.0s)]
*  You've been really stellar at what you do and at your craft and you're going to continue. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=16.0s)]
*  And it's really been an honor to have spent so much time with you and watching you and the whole group in the morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=21.6s)]
*  It's the number one show in the business and it's going to stay that way for a long time to come and you were a big part of it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=28.0s)]
*  So thank you for all of your service because truly it was service. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=34.1s)]
*  You've worked so hard and now you're going to have another different dimension at Fox and who knows maybe it's going to be even bigger and better. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=37.9s)]
*  But you are a very very good man and your son is going to represent you well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=46.0s)]
*  Peter's of equal talent at least. In fact, you would say he's even better than you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  So just take care of yourself. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=56.5s)]
*  Say hello to your family, especially your wife. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=58.2s)]
*  I know she's going to be feeling better really soon and you're a special guy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=60.8s)]
*  Thank you very much, Steve. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuyM0GT7yUI&t=64.7s)]
