# Bondi, Leavitt call out Dems, media after new details revealed on MS-13 suspect
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A)
*  But first, allow me to introduce you to the new face of hypocrisy, hysteria, feigned moral [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=0.0s)]
*  outrage inside the Democratic Party. That would be Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen. Now, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  when Joe Biden allowed an estimated, what, 12-plus million unvetted illegal immigrants to pour into [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=11.28s)]
*  our country, including known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=17.44s)]
*  Van Hollen did nothing and he said nothing. When Maryland, a mother of five, Rachel Moran, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=23.12s)]
*  was raped brutally, murdered brutally by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador on a Maryland [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=28.8s)]
*  hiking trail, Van Hollen could only be bothered to release a shortwritten statement to a news outlet. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=35.28s)]
*  When 20-year-old Maryland woman Kayla Hamilton was raped and murdered in her own Maryland home by [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=41.36s)]
*  another illegal immigrant from El Salvador, Chris Van Hollen expressed zero public outrage. But now [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  that a citizen from El Salvador, not Maryland, who entered our country illegally and was accused [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=53.92s)]
*  of assaulting his own wife and accused of our own federal government under two administrations [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  of violent gang activity, now that this illegal immigrant has been deported back to his home, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=66.4s)]
*  all of a sudden Chris Van Hollen is all up in arms. He has found his voice. He is outraged. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  In the past 48 hours, Van Hollen has rushed in front of every microphone, every camera he could [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=79.84s)]
*  find, giving one impassioned plea after another, vowing to rescue and bring back to America this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  illegal immigrant that got deported. And today, Chris Van Hollen flew to El Salvador for the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=92.64s)]
*  dumbest, most pointless political stunt in recent history. We'll let you decide. Take a look. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=98.64s)]
*  I'm here at the airport. I'm about to board my flight for San Salvador. The goal of this mission [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=104.72s)]
*  is to let the Trump administration, to let the government of El Salvador know [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=110.4s)]
*  that we are going to keep fighting to bring Abrego Garcia home. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=115.44s)]
*  I just landed at the airport in San Salvador a little while ago. As I've said before, the goal [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  of my visit is to talk to people here about the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. And I won't stop [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  trying. And I can assure the president, the vice president, that I may be the first United States [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  senator to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more and there will be more members [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=140.4s)]
*  of Congress coming. I tend to doubt it. But by the way, if he does, if he is successful, maybe he can [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  invite him to live with him. It's no surprise Van Hollen left empty handed. He couldn't even get a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=151.44s)]
*  phone call with this illegal immigrant, much less secure his release from an El Salvador jail. But [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen is still vowing to quote, bring him home. Good luck with that. Now, Chris, he is, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=162.96s)]
*  he is home. He is not a Maryland man like you and every other Democrat and everyone in the state run [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=168.72s)]
*  legacy media mob is claiming. He's not an American. He's not your constituent. He was not in our country [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=174.88s)]
*  legally, according to a report, John Solomon. He even admitted to police that he entered our country [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  illegally. In other words, you're a lawmaker, right? Didn't follow our laws, didn't respect our [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=189.36s)]
*  borders or our sovereignty. He had no right to be here. And you know who should still be here, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  safe and sound in your state of Maryland? That would be Kayla Hamilton and Rachel Moran. But you [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=202.4s)]
*  didn't lift a finger for Rachel or a family or anyone in your state or anyone in this country [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=208.4s)]
*  to protect them from the likes of those illegals that murdered them or involved with them. And Chris [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=214.16s)]
*  Van Hollen, well, couldn't be bothered with their safety and security. To be honest, he's barely said [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  anything at all about these two victims of illegal immigration. He might not even know who they are. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=224.88s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen is a disgrace to the entire state of Maryland, frankly to the entire country. You [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=230.48s)]
*  know, this, this performative art is just a joke. He's lying. He's grandstanding. It's frankly repulsive. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=236.72s)]
*  He should be ashamed of himself. Better yet, maybe he should take some time and listen to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=243.76s)]
*  Rachel Moran's mother and reevaluate his entire political career. Here's what she said on our show [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  last night. Take a look. Did you ever get a call from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=254.88s)]
*  or your Senator Van Hollen who made a big deal about he's going to go to El Salvador and, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=264.8s)]
*  and bring home this one illegal from El Salvador, who Democrats are saying had no business being [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=272.64s)]
*  sent back to his home country? Did they ever call you? And what are your thoughts on your Senator [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  going to bat for this illegal? But did he ever say anything to you and your family about your loss [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=287.76s)]
*  to ever call you ever take the time to be with you? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=294.8s)]
*  No, actually, I'm very angry. I'm actually outraged, but I'm too sad at the moment to show [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=297.44s)]
*  anger at the same time. He, he did not call our family. He did not give condolences. There was no [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=305.52s)]
*  action on the Democrat, Democratic Party in any way from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayorkas, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=314.64s)]
*  um, anyone here in Maryland, none of the senators did anything to help search for the murder of my [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  daughter. Now, in case the Senator did miss our show, only hours ago, Patty Morin had this to say [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  at the White House briefing with Caroline Levitt and Caroline will also join us later in the show. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=339.68s)]
*  Take a look. Why are we not protecting the American citizens? It's just common sense. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=344.96s)]
*  Why are we not protecting our children? And to have a Senator from Maryland who didn't even [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=352.96s)]
*  acknowledge or barely acknowledged my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=362.32s)]
*  children without a mother and now a grandbaby without a grandmother so that he can use my [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=371.36s)]
*  taxpayer money to fly to El Salvador to bring back someone that's not even an American citizen. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=379.6s)]
*  Why does that person have more right than I do or my daughter or my grandchildren? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't, I don't understand this. I've said it before. I will say it again. Joe Biden, Kamala [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=397.6s)]
*  Harris, Mayorkas and everybody that stood by silently and didn't lift a finger to secure our [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=405.44s)]
*  border, as far as I'm concerned, they all have blood on their hands. And by the way, they did [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=411.12s)]
*  not have the courage to even call these families, Lake and Riley's family. They didn't have the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=415.76s)]
*  courage to call Jocelyn Ungary's family or, you know, in this case, Rachel Moran's mother. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=421.92s)]
*  Why not? And why didn't they speak out about Biden's open borders? Why didn't they seem to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=428.8s)]
*  have even the slightest interest in honoring Rachel Moran or any of the other victims of illegal [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=433.44s)]
*  immigration? Senator Van Hollen needs to sit down or shut up or maybe he could just stay in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  El Salvador. To be honest, Van Hollen should be thanking President Trump for doing something [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  he himself never had the courage to do, protecting the people, the moms and dads, the sons and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=450.64s)]
*  daughters of children in Maryland and deporting illegal immigrants who never should be in our [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=456.96s)]
*  country at all. If they want to come in our country, come in, come in legally. We'll have a lot [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=462.88s)]
*  more on this in just a moment with Caroline Levitt. Joining us now first is the U.S. Attorney General, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=467.12s)]
*  Pam Bondi is with us. Pam, great to see you. I want to put up on the screen a timeline because [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  there seems to be, in the media especially, a narrative that is completely and totally and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=476.56s)]
*  utterly false regarding, quote, Mr. Garcia. And not one but two courts actually said he was an MS-13 [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=481.84s)]
*  gang member and identified him as such. Can you please explain what you know about him? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=491.92s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, factually, this is an extremely disturbing case. And as a career prosecutor, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=497.76s)]
*  it is even more disturbing. Every American tonight should be thanking Donald Trump for [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=504.32s)]
*  making America safer by getting this guy out of our country. I'm going to call him a terrorist [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=510.0s)]
*  because he has been designated as a member of a terrorist organization. So this illegal alien [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=515.6s)]
*  terrorist came into our country illegally in March of 2012. We know that because he admitted that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=521.76s)]
*  when he was stopped in 2019 by the anti-gang squad, they stopped him at a Home Depot with three [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=528.72s)]
*  other members. And here's what's very important. He was wearing a sweatshirt with gang insignia on [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=538.0s)]
*  it. The guy he was with, another MS-13 known member, had a tattoo with very similar insignia [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=544.56s)]
*  on it. ICE declared him as a member of MS-13. The police officers, the gang unit, declared him as [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=553.76s)]
*  a member of MS-13. And also, they independently went to a reliable confidential informant who said [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  not only is he a member of MS-13, he gave them the clique, the Westerns, and he was called a Chicao, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=570.72s)]
*  which is one of the higher ranking MS-13 members. So they rightfully detained him, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=577.76s)]
*  rightfully. An immigration judge agreed. An appellate immigration judge agreed. Now here's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=585.6s)]
*  where it gets even more frightening. In 2021, his girlfriend previously, his wife at the time, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=592.72s)]
*  who he had married in jail after he'd gotten numerous tickets, didn't show up for court, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=599.92s)]
*  he marries her in jail, she has a baby with him, and as a career domestic violence prosecutor too, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=604.64s)]
*  I know it takes a lot for any woman to come into court and say they're a victim of domestic violence. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=611.28s)]
*  This woman came into court twice getting a restraining order against him, saying it's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=618.56s)]
*  horrific. He had beaten her, he had punched her in the eye, he had ripped her clothes off. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=626.56s)]
*  What causes a young mother to do this? Her child was with her. She talked about her child in the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=631.68s)]
*  petition for an injunction for safety. Ultimately, she didn't show up for court. That's your typical [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  domestic violence victim. But this victim was even braver because she was married to one of the top [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  MS-13 members who was illegally in our country and a terrorist. So now he gets— [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, go ahead, Sean. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=659.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm finished. No, no, no, you finish. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=660.16s)]
*  So Sean, he under Donald Trump's incredible plan to get these alien enemies, these terrorists, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=664.08s)]
*  out of our country. He is deported. He is deported back to where he came from, El Salvador. He is [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=671.12s)]
*  sitting in a prison, and every American should be thanking President Trump tonight and every liberal [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=677.92s)]
*  journalist who has called him a Maryland man and saying he was rightfully in this country should [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=684.08s)]
*  be apologizing tonight to President Trump. Well, I'm trying to understand that part, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=689.6s)]
*  and I'm looking at the timeline. I'm looking at what the courts have said about him. I'm looking [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  about what ICE has said about him. I'm looking about at—even though I'm having a hard time [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=700.0s)]
*  understanding why his wife is advocating for him to come back, why is everybody saying he's a man [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=705.2s)]
*  from Maryland? What do you make of Senator Van Hollen and, you know, this performative art that [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=712.72s)]
*  he's involved in in El Salvador, of which he was unsuccessful today? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=718.24s)]
*  Well, America is safer because he is gone. Maryland is safer because he is gone. And that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=724.0s)]
*  woman that he is married to and that child he had with her, they are safer tonight because he is [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=731.28s)]
*  out of our country and sitting in El Salvador where he belongs. These people are there saying [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=738.88s)]
*  because we needed to do—the government needed to do one extra step, they're saying, of paperwork. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=745.76s)]
*  Here's why. Because initially he claimed there was a rival gang—so he's saying he's a gang member. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=752.64s)]
*  There's a rival gang in El Salvador, which no longer exists, by the way, that could have hurt him [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=758.96s)]
*  if he had gone back to El Salvador. So by—there was no ending for him, none, where he would end up [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=764.4s)]
*  staying in this country. And President Bukele made it crystal clear that he is not returning him [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=772.0799999999999s)]
*  to our country. Our only job legally was to facilitate it if, according to the Supreme Court, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=779.68s)]
*  President Bukele wanted him to come back to our country. And he does not want him back, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=786.64s)]
*  and we do not want him back in our country. Yeah. All right. Attorney General Pam Bondi, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=792.08s)]
*  thank you for setting the record straight. As always, we appreciate it. Now, unfortunately, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=798.32s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen is not the only dishonest Democrat now feigning moral outrage over [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=802.72s)]
*  an illegal immigrant while all but ignoring the victims of illegal immigration. According to the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=808.24s)]
*  Media Research Center, ABC, CBS, NBC, they spent zero minutes on the trial for Rachel Moran's killer [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=814.08s)]
*  at the same time they spent over an hour covering the illegal immigrant that was [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=821.76s)]
*  deported to El Salvador. Does that make sense? The state-run legacy media mob likes to call [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=825.84s)]
*  him a Maryland man, as we've been telling you, even though he's not from Maryland, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=830.8s)]
*  has no right to be in Maryland, and has been deported back to his home country. Take a look. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=834.8s)]
*  Exactly one month ago, the Trump administration abducted and imprisoned a Maryland man named [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=840.64s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. They flew him and hundreds of other men to a prison in El Salvador. Kilmar [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia, the Maryland man, a Maryland man, Maryland man, the growing calls to return the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=850.48s)]
*  Maryland man, that Maryland man, the Maryland man, that fate of that Maryland man, in the case [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=855.12s)]
*  of a Maryland father, the wrongful deportation of a Maryland man to El Salvador. He is, of course, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=861.04s)]
*  the Maryland man now held in El Salvador's mega prison. Just imagine if I snuck into any country, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=865.76s)]
*  let's pick Canada, for example, and while getting deported, everyone referred to me as that Canadian [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=873.44s)]
*  man, that Montreal man. This is the literal definition of fake news, or as they like to call [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=878.96s)]
*  it, misinformation, or if you prefer, a cheap fake. Anyway, here now with Reaction, it is time for the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  Hannity Press Briefing with White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. Boy, very powerful. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I think actually all of your press briefings are pretty powerful, because I love watching the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=898.32s)]
*  liberal media melt and bubble and fizz like alcohol, seltzer and water, but it was powerful. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  We had Patty, Rachel's mom, on this show last night, and what she said at that podium today was [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=907.28s)]
*  extremely powerful, which is why I assume you decided, you know what, that's enough for today. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=913.28s)]
*  I think that speaks for itself. What was that like for you? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=919.04s)]
*  It was incredibly difficult, Sean, to stand beside Patty Morin, a mother who has experienced every [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=924.0799999999999s)]
*  mother's worst nightmare, and it was incredibly powerful to listen to her words, because they are [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=932.0s)]
*  the truth, the brutal truth about what happened to her beautiful daughter at the hands of a [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=937.68s)]
*  heinous monster who should have never been allowed into our country in the first place, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=943.52s)]
*  and Patty was so courageous and brave to share the gruesome details about her daughter's murder, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=949.6s)]
*  and thank goodness our justice system convicted this illegal alien criminal murderer of the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=956.08s)]
*  heinous killing of Patty's daughter, and I was so honored to stand beside her today, and it speaks [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=962.96s)]
*  to just the, she also spoke to just the lack of common sense by today's modern-day Democrat party, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=968.72s)]
*  because you have a senator in Maryland who is supposed to serve his constituents, including [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  Morin and Rachel Morin and their family, and instead he is spending more time wasting taxpayer [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=981.6s)]
*  dollars flying to a foreign country in an attempt to bring back an illegal criminal alien foreign [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=989.8399999999999s)]
*  terrorist gang member than he ever gave the time to Patty Morin and her mourning family over the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=996.4s)]
*  loss of his constituent. This shows you how deranged the modern-day Democrat party has truly [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  become, and we are incredibly grateful for Patty for her willingness and her request [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1009.6s)]
*  to share her story at the White House briefing room today. Well, we see that they're silent when [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1014.24s)]
*  we see these acts of domestic terrorism against Tesla. We see that the Democratic party is now [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1019.28s)]
*  the party of championing the right of men to play women's sports, putting the rights of illegals [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1025.2s)]
*  over the safety of Americans, screaming bloody murder, and that we're experiencing a constitutional [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1030.4s)]
*  crisis if we cut out waste, fraud and abuse and corruption. That is the party that they now [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1037.52s)]
*  represent. That's fine if that's where they want to be. Do we have an update? I know that there [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1043.52s)]
*  was discussions today regarding trade and tariffs with Japan. I expect that probably a lot of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  countries are going to be signing deals in the days and weeks ahead. Can you update us? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1054.96s)]
*  I don't have an update for you. I actually just left a dinner with the president and Patty Morin [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1060.24s)]
*  and some great faith leaders in celebration of Holy Week, so I haven't checked in with [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1064.8s)]
*  our secretary of treasury or Jameson Greer, our United States trade ambassador, yet. However, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1068.8s)]
*  I did run into the secretary of treasury and he told me the meetings were productive and they [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1073.76s)]
*  were moving along and they were here for quite some time. And the president met directly with [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  one of the trade representatives from Japan because the president wants to be involved in [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1083.12s)]
*  these negotiations and these talks. And I think it speaks volumes about the number of countries we [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1087.28s)]
*  have seen come to the table reaching out to this administration to cut deals. It's because the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1092.48s)]
*  entire world knows they need to do business with the United States of America. And China knows that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1097.44s)]
*  too, Sean. And as president Trump directed me to say yesterday, it remains true tonight, the ball [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1102.8s)]
*  is in China's court. They need to do business with the United States. They need the best thing on the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1107.92s)]
*  face of the planet. And that is the American consumer. And we have, we are the best place in [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1112.96s)]
*  the world to do business. And the rest of the world knows that. And that's why Japan was here [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1118.56s)]
*  today to negotiate a trade deal. It's kind of a simple concept. If a country wants free and fair [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  trade, or if they want to put tariffs on us, they'll have reciprocal tariffs. It doesn't seem that [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1127.6s)]
*  complicated. And if they're going to put barriers up to products being sold in their country, we'll [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  do the same back to them. If they don't want to do it, then it'll be really free and fair trade. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1139.36s)]
*  And that would be something that has not happened in our country in what, 50 years, 60 years? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1144.16s)]
*  Anyway, Caroline Levitt, we appreciate you being with us. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCkM9xTB0A&t=1152.16s)]
