# Relative of 10-month-old hostage distraught over familyâ€™s continued detainment
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM)
*  Hamas refuses to release its youngest hostage, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=0.0s)]
*  handing him over to his family, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=2.32s)]
*  to another terror group in Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=3.88s)]
*  10-month-old Kefir Bebas and his 4-year-old brother Ariel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=6.76s)]
*  were abducted last month with their parents. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  You see their pictures. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=14.56s)]
*  Sheree and Yarden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=15.96s)]
*  Sheree's aunt, Ifat Zayler, joins us live from Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=18.12s)]
*  Ifat, good afternoon to you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=22.44s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=23.68s)]
*  We just heard from Trey that your relative, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  this little 10-month-old baby, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=29.32s)]
*  essentially is being used as leverage and a human shield. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=31.84s)]
*  How does the family feel about that? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=36.64s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=41.2s)]
*  I can't say we are surprised about the level of cruelty [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=45.44s)]
*  and unhumane behavior from Hamas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  In this deal, in this ceasefire, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=53.72s)]
*  they signed an agreement to release [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=56.2s)]
*  all women and children. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=58.2s)]
*  Tomorrow is the last day, supposedly, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=61.28s)]
*  of this ceasefire, of this agreement, as it was signed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=64.36s)]
*  And there's still no news about my family, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=70.88s)]
*  if they'll be returned or not. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=73.64s)]
*  What do you... [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=77.2s)]
*  Go ahead, Lauren. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=78.04s)]
*  Go ahead, Aisley. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=78.88s)]
*  Do you think that the Israel administration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=79.72s)]
*  should do another ceasefire then, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  if they haven't kept their commitment, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=85.72s)]
*  and we want your loved ones home? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=88.72s)]
*  But do you think Israel should continue [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  this route of negotiations with Hamas [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  since they've already lied? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=95.08s)]
*  It's a very complicated question, is what you're asking. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=99.44s)]
*  Of course, in my opinion, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=103.0s)]
*  the ceasefire should continue until we receive, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=105.56s)]
*  if not all hostages back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=110.52s)]
*  You know, all the men there, all the wounded people, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=113.36s)]
*  are all families here that are waiting. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=116.12s)]
*  All have mothers, all have children [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=118.68s)]
*  that are waiting for them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=120.56s)]
*  This deal is discussing only women and children. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=122.28s)]
*  I think they're probably stalling. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=127.44s)]
*  You know, every day of ceasefire, they receive fuel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=130.96s)]
*  It gives Hamas opportunity to rearrange. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=135.76s)]
*  We are at war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=138.88s)]
*  And I don't know, I think maybe, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=140.88s)]
*  I don't know, it's crazy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=146.84s)]
*  It's crazy just thinking about it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  We're waiting hopelessly, trying to remain positive. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Every day counts for that baby. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=157.84s)]
*  It's been two months, almost two months. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=161.04s)]
*  He was nine months when he was kidnapped. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=163.56s)]
*  It's gonna be 11 months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=165.24s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=167.24s)]
*  We are hearing all the evidence about the conditions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=169.84s)]
*  of those kidnapped people, about how they were fed and... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=173.64s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  It's okay, take your time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  Of course it's hard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Ife, when we look at the pictures, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=184.44s)]
*  I'm a mother and I remember when my little girl was this age [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=188.11999999999998s)]
*  and she needed me to feed milk. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=191.6s)]
*  She couldn't go to the kitchen and get food on her own. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  I was thankful when I read that, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=197.56s)]
*  I believe they're still together as a family unit. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=203.76s)]
*  So that at least she has her baby? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=204.6s)]
*  We haven't heard, no, we haven't had any intelligence [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=206.44s)]
*  that point that out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  We do know that they separated women and children. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=211.72s)]
*  We do know that they were kidnapped separately. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  Yarden, the father was kidnapped first [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=220.6s)]
*  and then they entered the house, the safe room. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  He went outside to protect his family [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=226.44s)]
*  and was hurt and kidnapped. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=229.12s)]
*  And then they entered inside and found Shiri, my cousin, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=231.6s)]
*  and her two children and kidnapped them as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=235.32s)]
*  So we don't know if they're together. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=239.0s)]
*  We can only assume by hearing the evidence [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  from the freed members of the same kibbutz [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=245.08s)]
*  where they lived that they say [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=250.28s)]
*  that they separated men and women. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=251.88s)]
*  This is what I've heard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  They got their plan on their evil, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=256.44s)]
*  with their evil intentions, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=260.44s)]
*  went so well from their perspective, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  they got more hostages than they thought. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  And they pulled back [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=266.28s)]
*  and the minute they crossed the border, chaos. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=267.2s)]
*  And groups were just grabbing them from Hamas. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=269.88s)]
*  From what you can tell, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  do you think Hamas even knows where they are? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=274.96s)]
*  Is there a chance they're not in control of your family? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=278.12s)]
*  Listen, there are different groups inside the Gaza Strip, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  but Hamas is controlling Gaza [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=286.56s)]
*  ever since 2007, since we left Israel, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=288.96s)]
*  when left Gaza and Hamas is controlling there powerfully. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=292.64s)]
*  I think, in my opinion again, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  that saying that they don't know where they are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  is another way of stalling and buying time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=306.28s)]
*  Sure, and then if something happens to your family, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=309.88s)]
*  don't blame us, we gave them to somebody else. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  But Ifat, it sounds like what they have done [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=315.72s)]
*  is they have handed your family off [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=319.36s)]
*  to another group in Southern Gaza, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=322.04s)]
*  which is exactly where the IDF [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=326.12s)]
*  wants to move into militarily. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=328.24s)]
*  So essentially it's a, hey, don't do this, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=331.24s)]
*  or you might accidentally blow up this family. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=334.44000000000005s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=341.04s)]
*  And let me just say that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=342.68s)]
*  at 240 at the beginning, people that were kidnapped [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=346.32s)]
*  and they were held in different places, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  and some of them underground, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=356.88s)]
*  some of them probably in apartments, I don't know, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=358.6s)]
*  even in the north of the Strip. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=362.2s)]
*  And it's been a concern of us, of course, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=364.44s)]
*  for their wellbeing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=368.52s)]
*  Everyone's saying that they need them alive, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=370.76s)]
*  so they're probably trying to protect them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=373.68s)]
*  I know we heard rumors that Hamas promised a reward [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=377.84s)]
*  for everyone who brings back someone from Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=382.44s)]
*  So there's a lot of different interests. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=388.44s)]
*  I'm not a politician, I'm not a military general, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm a family member. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=397.6s)]
*  My heart is broken. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  Kfir and Ariel's grandparents were brutally murdered, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=405.56s)]
*  so they won't be waiting for them in the hospital. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=408.56s)]
*  They lost their home, they have nothing to come back to. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=414.88s)]
*  Every family that you see, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  those children receiving that dog, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=422.04s)]
*  and they have no home to go back to. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=424.08s)]
*  No, nothing that they knew from their previous life exists. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  So, and every family lost someone. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=434.56s)]
*  Some of those children come back, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  and now they're hearing that their father died, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=441.36s)]
*  or their uncle died, or their grandparents died. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  Entire communities got, may I say, deleted. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=448.0s)]
*  In fact, you tell the story so well, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  yet in our country, as you look on TV internationally, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=457.44s)]
*  there are people that are protesting [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=461.4s)]
*  in the middle of the streets saying that it did not happen. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  There are people that are taking signs down [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=465.84s)]
*  of your loved ones in New York City, in major cities. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=468.44s)]
*  If you had the opportunity to talk [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=472.32s)]
*  to all these college students, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=475.0s)]
*  all these people that are protesting, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=476.24s)]
*  what would you tell them? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=478.08s)]
*  I was raised to believe in humanity, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=483.52s)]
*  to believe in peace, to know that two people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=491.44s)]
*  can tell the same story, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  and it will sound completely different, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  and you should always check. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=501.32s)]
*  And I was born and raised in Israel [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  on one side of this conflict, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  and I always educate myself, and I learn, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=508.4s)]
*  but at the end of the day, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=511.04s)]
*  even if there were mistakes during history, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  I would never raise my children to say [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=517.36s)]
*  that someone is deserved to die, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=519.36s)]
*  someone's not deserving his rights to exist. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=522.64s)]
*  I will never, never stand behind a group [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=530.48s)]
*  that kidnaps children, and all, I don't know, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  it's early morning, and probably there are children [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  watching the screen, so I don't want to discuss [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=541.16s)]
*  all the brutal acts that were made and done [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=543.4799999999999s)]
*  in those kibbutzim by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=548.88s)]
*  I won't change anyone's political point of view, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=554.4s)]
*  but a child is a child. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=557.36s)]
*  No child should suffer. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=561.8s)]
*  I think Oscar Wilde said, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=564.48s)]
*  if you want to raise good children, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=565.88s)]
*  you need to make them happy, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=569.64s)]
*  and not another generation should born into this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=571.32s)]
*  And if you scream from the river to the sea, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=574.08s)]
*  you're basically saying that I'm not supposed [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=576.24s)]
*  to raise my two children here, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=581.44s)]
*  and my family, who lost so much, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=584.9200000000001s)]
*  deserves what's happening to her, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=589.08s)]
*  to us, I'm sorry. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=591.0s)]
*  No, thank you so much, Ifah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=595.28s)]
*  I appreciate you sharing your story, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd4WWOnvAVM&t=596.72s)]
