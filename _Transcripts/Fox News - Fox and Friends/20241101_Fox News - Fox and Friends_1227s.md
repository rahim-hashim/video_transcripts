# Women angered by Mark Cuban's bombshell comments
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8)
*  Look at that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=0.0s)]
*  I wasn't sure until Chris Chulo slowly pulled out with his camera. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=5.48s)]
*  There's only four days left until election day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  And the Harris campaign is back in damage control. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=11.72s)]
*  This morning's cover of the New York Post reads, say it to their faces. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=14.4s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=19.04s)]
*  It's a message to Mark Cuban, the billionaire, following these controversial remarks that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=20.04s)]
*  he made on The View yesterday about former President Trump and who he surrounds himself [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=24.66s)]
*  with. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=29.92s)]
*  Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=31.62s)]
*  Ever. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=35.42s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=36.86s)]
*  They're intimidating to him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=37.86s)]
*  He doesn't like to be challenged by them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=39.42s)]
*  And you know, Nikki Haley will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=42.5s)]
*  how he sees and treats and talks about women. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=47.2s)]
*  I mean, he just can't have her around. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=50.3s)]
*  It wouldn't work. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=52.3s)]
*  So literally, the campaign went from the day before trash talk to talk about gender. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=54.58s)]
*  And there was back and forth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=60.28s)]
*  Ultimately, Mark Cuban gave the Trump campaign a gift and it was something they seized upon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=62.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so many women that are helping him behind the scenes that support him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=68.94s)]
*  Mark Cuban realized that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=74.38s)]
*  He tried to walk it back. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=75.74s)]
*  This is part of his post on social media because it was pretty long. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=77.22s)]
*  I know many strong, intelligent women voting for Trump, including in my extended family. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=81.54s)]
*  I'm certainly not saying female voters are not smart, strong and intelligent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=86.94000000000001s)]
*  I know he has worked with strong, intelligent women like Elaine Chao, Kellyanne Ivanka and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=91.34s)]
*  many others. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  How about Suzy Wiles? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  Suzy Wiles ran the entire campaign. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  Suzy did put something on social media. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  Did you read that? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  I'll try to find it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  Well, you do that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  John Wayne is the first woman to run a successful presidential campaign. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=107.02s)]
*  When he had a chance to revamp and he made his move, made his move, he called on her. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=111.38s)]
*  And the thing about her too, when it comes to Nikki Haley, guess who hired Nikki Haley? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=117.34s)]
*  This was in reference to what he was saying about Nikki Haley and why they're not campaigning [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=121.58s)]
*  together. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=125.06s)]
*  Well, they campaigned against each other, but he first worked together to the point [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=126.06s)]
*  where if you read Nikki Haley's book, she says, I have to report directly to you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=130.14s)]
*  And she ended up having a huge problem with the chief of staff, Kelly, as well as Madison. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=134.34s)]
*  They weren't listening to her. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=138.74s)]
*  So it ended up Donald Trump had to step in and say, you come right to me with any issues [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=139.94s)]
*  because she was strong, willing to take on the Marine general, four-star general over [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=144.86s)]
*  and over again. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  I just think out of all the things about President Trump that you could say that you want to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  challenge him on, I don't think he's vulnerable here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=154.22s)]
*  Well, the huge problem also is that this happened on The View, a show that's full of women and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=157.02s)]
*  there was no pushback. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=164.06s)]
*  Is there only one acceptable voice that can be on The View or acceptable person is only [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=165.54s)]
*  the person that is anti-Trump? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  You don't hear anything from Liz Cheney. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=175.06s)]
*  We know this is not true. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=177.26s)]
*  He surrounds himself with people with different points of views and they duke it out and that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  should be totally fine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=183.17999999999998s)]
*  But leading up to the election, it seems like the only woman voice that matters is the Democrat [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=184.82s)]
*  woman. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  I'll find it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=190.17999999999998s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=191.17999999999998s)]

*  I'm going to ask you a question. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=231.18s)]
*  The Trump remark that R.F.K. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=232.18s)]
*  Jr. would work on women's health in the administration and the campaign, the Harris campaign, amplified [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=234.18s)]
*  both saying both of those things would be bad for women. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=240.38s)]
*  Yeah, but he was talking about safety that made it seem like it was about a reproductive [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=244.34s)]
*  thing when it came to abortion where women supported, you know, protections such as being [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=250.66s)]
*  as pro-life or not. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=257.22s)]
*  The comments had nothing to do with that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  They know it, but they made it seem like that instead of it was about safety. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=261.14s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump, his team is going to be in Georgia. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=265.06s)]
*  The women, they're calling this the women's tour. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=268.74s)]
*  They're going to start in Atlanta over the weekend. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=271.18s)]
*  They're doing that tomorrow. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=273.18s)]
*  It's featuring Laura Trump, Governor Kristi Noem, Governor Sarah Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=274.7s)]
*  Danica Patrick, Sage Steele, Caroline Levitt. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=280.06s)]
*  Caroline Levitt was on Fox and Friends first earlier, and she was talking about this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=283.02s)]
*  First he said God's first. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=287.3s)]
*  The Democrats said God's in guns. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=288.58s)]
*  That was Obama. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  Then they said basket of deplorables. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  Then they called Republicans smelly Walmart shoppers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=292.7s)]
*  Then they called Republicans garbage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=295.38s)]
*  And now they're saying the women that are surrounding Trump are dumb and are weak. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=297.58s)]
*  They're not strong and intelligent. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, Mark Cuban was talking about Nikki Haley. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=303.98s)]
*  Nikki Haley, there's a story in Politico this morning that says that Nikki Haley remains [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=306.1s)]
*  on standby. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=309.42s)]
*  If Trump needs her to show up and do something in the final hours, she's on board. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=310.42s)]
*  She says there's no bad blood. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=316.94s)]
*  She wants him to win. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=318.18s)]
*  He's not picked up the phone yet. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=320.66s)]
*  Apparently they haven't spoken since June, but she is ready to help him. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=322.42s)]
*  Dave McCormick, she was with Dave McCormick yesterday, two days ago. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=325.70000000000005s)]
*  And one of the things she said is Dave can't win without Donald Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=329.38s)]
*  And Donald Trump needs Dave McCormick. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  He goes, so whatever you think about Donald Trump, his policies are right. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=335.18s)]
*  There's a lot of noise. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=338.98s)]
*  His policies are right. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=340.14000000000004s)]
*  Vote for Trump. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=341.26s)]
*  And then you'll bring Dave across the finish line. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=342.5s)]
*  He was on with Brett yesterday. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=344.26s)]
*  There's a couple of things. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=345.94s)]
*  Mark Cuban as a surrogate is really strong for him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=346.98s)]
*  But I watched the 101 interview when they talked for 15 minutes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=350.78s)]
*  I guess this airs on his own podcast. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=353.42s)]
*  He led Harris. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=355.7s)]
*  He basically said, you think this and you think that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=357.34s)]
*  He made more sense than Harris has made the entire time, including her years as her few [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=360.5s)]
*  months as a candidate and a few months and three and a half years as a vice president. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=366.74s)]
*  But there's two things he said that have hurt her. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=371.54s)]
*  Number one, they asked, why did the border wide open? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=374.06s)]
*  He said, well, because I think Biden and Harris have the big heart. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=376.18s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=379.3s)]
*  I mean, that's terrible. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=380.3s)]
*  Just not practical. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=381.3s)]
*  Yeah, not practical. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=382.3s)]
*  And when he comes out here, I have no idea what he was trying to say. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=383.3s)]
*  I guess he was trying to make sure there was a schism between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=386.14s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=392.02s)]
*  And this is another time. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=393.74s)]
*  Now think about this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=394.74s)]
*  The surrogate Joe Biden and the surrogate Mark Cuban have put the Harris campaign on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=395.74s)]
*  their heels for two straight days and given fuel to Donald Trump's. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=402.18s)]
*  While the comedian who never even met Donald Trump, as far as we know, they tried to destroy [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=406.18s)]
*  him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=411.74s)]
*  So in the same day they go, the comedian reflects what Donald Trump thinks. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=412.74s)]
*  That lasted a few hours. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=415.5s)]
*  They go, wait a second. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=416.5s)]
*  Now out comes Joe Biden with his statement of saying all his people, the Donald Trump [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=417.82000000000005s)]
*  voters are trash. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=424.38s)]
*  You can't say on one side of your mouth, the comedian speaks for Trump. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=425.94s)]
*  And the other side of your mouth say the president doesn't speak for the vice president. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=430.5s)]
*  Well, so you had the Obama bros who used to run the press shop under former president [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=433.54s)]
*  Barack Obama. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=438.38s)]
*  They got on Twitter yesterday and they put out this plea to all the surrogates. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=439.38s)]
*  They said, please just stay on message. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=442.58s)]
*  Stop going out there doing your own thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=445.7s)]
*  The problem is the campaign first doesn't have a message. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=447.74s)]
*  It's all anti-Trump. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=451.22s)]
*  And then number two, the message has been going on the attack. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  It's been so negative. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=456.94s)]
*  The joy has been gone away. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=458.3s)]
*  And so I think Mark Cuban was actually trying to be helpful. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=460.38s)]
*  But he did more damage in the process of doing that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=463.1s)]
*  It seems to me, Lawrence, that there's no coaching of the surrogates. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=466.86s)]
*  How about a conference call or a Zoom call? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=469.38s)]
*  Or you can use FaceTime. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  There's other different apps you can use. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  When you get together, guys, it's 8 o'clock in the morning. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=474.42s)]
*  This is where it's going to be our message today. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=477.1s)]
*  Instead, Bill Clinton said, I want yesterday, just to paraphrase, I want you to vote for [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=478.5s)]
*  Harris. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=483.3s)]
*  Just because Donald Trump's economy was better doesn't mean you can't vote for Harris. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=484.3s)]
*  Thanks, Bill. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=488.1s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=489.1s)]
*  Keep up the good work. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=490.1s)]
*  So ultimately, as these new campaign bombs are dropped in the final hours, the question [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=492.14000000000004s)]
*  is, does it matter? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=497.62s)]
*  Because down in Georgia, where Will is, about half the people have already voted. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=499.14000000000004s)]
*  And he's there with a bunch of women as well who are wanting to talk about what we were [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=503.70000000000005s)]
*  just talking about. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=509.26000000000005s)]
*  Will. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=510.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Steve. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=511.26000000000005s)]
*  By the way, welcome to Joe and Sam's in Watkinsville, Georgia. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=512.26s)]
*  Huge turnout, as you can see. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=516.14s)]
*  They were lined up before I got here. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=517.18s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=520.18s)]
*  I don't know which one of it was you on the couch that said something about coaching of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=521.18s)]
*  surrogates. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=524.74s)]
*  My question isn't so much if it's a lack of discipline or a revealing of true feelings [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=525.74s)]
*  about the people who they think disagree with them. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=530.9s)]
*  So that's what we were talking about. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=534.26s)]
*  Lauren, she said there's no joy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=535.26s)]
*  That's interesting you said that because that just came up. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=536.9s)]
*  I was talking to Carrie and her daughter, Ellery, which by the way is my wife's name [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=539.06s)]
*  as well. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=543.34s)]
*  Super awesome. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=544.34s)]
*  You were talking about how Trump takes you guys are wearing these these safety vests, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=546.02s)]
*  how he takes something that is an insult and turns it into something fun. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=549.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=552.62s)]
*  You know, he takes this. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=553.62s)]
*  We were on the way up here and we were talking about like one man's trash is another man's [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=555.3s)]
*  treasure, you know, and how he took what could have been, you know, or was trying to be very [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  negative and made it into such a positive thing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=564.78s)]
*  And it inspires us and you know, we get together and the more they try to beat him down, the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=567.9s)]
*  more it kind of raises us up. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  Ellery, was this your idea or was this your mom's? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=575.18s)]
*  Well, she came up with wearing our neon vests here, but I want to bedazzle them a little [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=577.38s)]
*  bit, make them more personalized. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  So we put some bling on it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=585.66s)]
*  Carrie was saying how fun was it when he climbed into the garbage truck? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=588.06s)]
*  Everything, you know, one campaign is selling itself as joy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=590.98s)]
*  One is actually having a joyful time. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=593.6999999999999s)]
*  Christine, I asked Christine, we were talking about Mark Cuban's comments that Trump doesn't [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=595.98s)]
*  like to have strong, independent women, smart women around him. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=599.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know about you, but I see a lot of really smart, independent women here. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=604.22s)]
*  And the thing that bothers me the most about that comment as a 21 year teacher is the fact [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=610.42s)]
*  that now he's also making comments about the girls that I taught, the the women in this [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=616.06s)]
*  country that are actually getting involved and wanting to be aware. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=622.26s)]
*  And he's calling them, you know, garbage or stupid. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=627.3s)]
*  This is not OK. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=631.66s)]
*  Biden calls the entire electric that disagrees with him garbage. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=633.34s)]
*  Cuban suggests that Trump doesn't hire strong women around him. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=637.34s)]
*  I give him Kayleigh McEnany. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=640.5400000000001s)]
*  I give him Sarah Huckabee Sanders. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=642.26s)]
*  I give him Amy Coney Barrett appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=645.3000000000001s)]
*  The other story outside of Georgia is that three point six million people have already [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=648.7s)]
*  cast their vote. That's up huge over the two point three million in 2020. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  Let me introduce you to Denise. By the way. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=658.26s)]
*  So you've lived here almost your entire life, but you were telling me this is the first [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=660.02s)]
*  year you voted. Yes. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=664.46s)]
*  This is the very first year I've ever voted. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=666.26s)]
*  I told my husband I needed to go vote because this year is very important. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=669.58s)]
*  Things are not good. And I've always thought that Georgia been a red, that there wasn't [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=677.1s)]
*  really any reason for me to vote. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  You thought it would just stay Republican, stay red. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=687.54s)]
*  So there wasn't any reason. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=689.86s)]
*  But this vote this year is very important. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=692.1s)]
*  Right. You saw what happened in 2020 and motivated her to come vote. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=694.86s)]
*  And then and so now we have Amy, by the way, this is your first time to vote, too. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=697.98s)]
*  Yes, sir. And is it your first time you're capable of voting? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=701.46s)]
*  Yes, sir. So you're like, what, 18, 19? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=705.82s)]
*  And which way are you going to vote? If you mind, if you don't mind sharing with the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=710.02s)]
*  entire United States of America. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=712.78s)]
*  For Donald Trump. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=714.82s)]
*  I and why is that? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=720.86s)]
*  Not only now does it come down to like just his political views that I do stand with, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=723.5s)]
*  but also protecting our faith and the people around us for like generations to come. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=727.82s)]
*  I think this vote is very important. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=732.1s)]
*  All right, there you go. So we're going to be here all morning long at Joe and Sam's. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=734.98s)]
*  I mean, as you can see, a ton of people. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=737.46s)]
*  So we're going to be talking to all of them throughout the morning. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=739.02s)]
*  Well, now, though, back to you guys in New York. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=743.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, let's talk politics and billionaire Mark Cuban, the guy from Shark Tank, a top [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=744.9s)]
*  surrogate for Kamala Harris, is facing major backlash after suggesting the women around [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=749.78s)]
*  former President Trump are weak and not so smart. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=755.06s)]
*  All right. Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy joins us live from Las Vegas. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  Peter. And if you're keeping score at home so far this week, a Harris surrogate, the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=762.86s)]
*  campaign doesn't want out there, suggested that all Trump supporters are garbage. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=770.26s)]
*  And then a Harris campaign surrogate that officials do want out there, suggested that [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=775.38s)]
*  female Trump supporters are not intelligent. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=780.6600000000001s)]
*  Here's Mark Cuban. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=783.86s)]
*  Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women ever. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=787.1800000000001s)]
*  It's just that simple. They're intimidating to him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=792.3000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't he doesn't like to be challenged by them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=794.6600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, Nikki Haley will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=797.94s)]
*  how he sees and treats and talks about women. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=802.9s)]
*  I mean, he just can't have her around. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=805.9s)]
*  It wouldn't work. The Cuban cleanup was quick and it was contrite on X, he says. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=807.9s)]
*  One, I know many strong, intelligent women voting for Trump, including in my extended [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=814.5799999999999s)]
*  family. I'm certainly not saying female voters are not smart, strong and intelligent. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=819.4599999999999s)]
*  Two, I know he has worked with strong, intelligent women like Elaine Chao, Kellyanne [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=824.4599999999999s)]
*  Ivanka and many others. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=829.86s)]
*  The Harris campaign boasts a lot about their historic gender gap. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=832.1s)]
*  We were on a call with campaign officials yesterday and they were telling us that 55 [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=836.62s)]
*  percent of the early vote in their calculation has been women. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=840.66s)]
*  They think that is good for them. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=843.66s)]
*  But it's tough to see how these Cuban comments help them improve the gender gap. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=845.7s)]
*  And we just don't know yet how much they might hurt. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=852.66s)]
*  Back to you. Indeed. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=854.94s)]
*  All right. Peter Ducey live out in Las Vegas. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=856.58s)]
*  Actually wearing a necktie the color of that vest. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=859.02s)]
*  Unrelated, I'm thinking. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=862.66s)]
*  It's a very Ivy League necktie. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=863.9399999999999s)]
*  I like it. It looks like it has like an emblem of a school on it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=866.02s)]
*  Yeah. Did you give him that? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=869.5s)]
*  I did, actually. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=871.06s)]
*  I used to wear that necktie on the Fox and Friends show. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=873.1s)]
*  Peter gets my hand-me-downs. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=876.54s)]
*  So we just going on some controversial with surrogates. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=878.06s)]
*  When Sarah gets attacked, when Sarah gets attacked, you have Bill Clinton commenting [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=880.6999999999999s)]
*  positively about the economy under Donald Trump. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=886.0600000000001s)]
*  And you should vote for Harris anyway. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=888.14s)]
*  After saying it's bad that the border failed, you know, that young lady would be alive if [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=889.82s)]
*  they had better security and background checks. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=894.4200000000001s)]
*  And then you have Mark Cuban, who's done a really good job talking about the economy and [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=896.54s)]
*  debating better than Kamala Harris on her behalf, if he asked me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=899.58s)]
*  But then making this statement, as you saw, saying the president doesn't like strong [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=904.58s)]
*  women around him, which just doesn't add up. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=909.1s)]
*  I mean, just to go on and continue with his apology. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=911.78s)]
*  You say when I said this during the interview, I didn't get it out the way I want. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=914.46s)]
*  Well, I thought I exactly the way I thought I did. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=917.86s)]
*  So I apologize to anyone who felt slighted by or upset by my response. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=920.9s)]
*  But here's the thing. It's no one feeling slighted or upset. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  It's not close to accurate. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=927.46s)]
*  I mean, think about the people that have been around him. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=928.9399999999999s)]
*  Hope Hicks has been his chief assistant, the youngest woman ever assistant to the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=931.42s)]
*  president. Sarah Sanders, the first working mom to be in the White House. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=934.42s)]
*  Does anyone think Sarah Sanders is a shrinking violet? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=937.9s)]
*  And you mentioned Dina Powell, the first deputy necessary adviser. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=941.6999999999999s)]
*  The president picked all these people to be around him. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=945.0999999999999s)]
*  And then you're seeing. Yeah. Then you're seeing this group. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=947.78s)]
*  The next wave of which could be a second term. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=950.54s)]
*  He built it around women. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=953.9s)]
*  Governor Kristi Noem, Tulsi Gabbard, Danica Patrick, Sage Steele, Caroline Leavitt. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=955.5799999999999s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=960.4599999999999s)]
*  He's surrounded by. And then we enter. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=962.02s)]
*  We were we had someone on this morning. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=963.78s)]
*  It's Brooke. Brooke Switzer, last name Rawlins. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=966.3399999999999s)]
*  She was the former domestic policy director. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=968.66s)]
*  Under President Trump. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=970.8199999999999s)]
*  And she said under his administration, more women worked for him than any other [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=972.06s)]
*  president ever. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=977.02s)]
*  So we've already heard Mark Cuban apologize. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=978.66s)]
*  He tried to walk it back as well, which is different than Joe Biden. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=981.62s)]
*  I mean, after Joe Biden threw the grenade into the Kamala Harris campaign the other [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=985.26s)]
*  day, he didn't apologize. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  At least Mark Cuban did that here, ladies and gentlemen, some of the ladies who [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=992.42s)]
*  actually have worked around Donald Trump. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=996.62s)]
*  This is what they had to say about Mr. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=998.62s)]
*  Cuban's comments. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1000.62s)]
*  The mainstream media covers for Kamala Harris and they don't hold her to the same [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1002.8199999999999s)]
*  standard that they hold Donald Trump. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1006.8199999999999s)]
*  She should take it upon herself. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1008.66s)]
*  Go to a microphone today, Kamala Harris, and condemn this disgusting insult on more [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1010.2199999999999s)]
*  than half of the females in this country who want to support Donald Trump. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1014.78s)]
*  What they stand for and what they believe is not where America is today. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1018.3399999999999s)]
*  So when he came out, you know, they're in full panic mode, I think, on the other [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1023.54s)]
*  side. And I think that from calling our side Nazis to garbage to now calling women [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1027.02s)]
*  dumb and unintelligent and weak around Donald Trump, almost as the last straw for [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1032.7s)]
*  a hundred million women in this country. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1038.46s)]
*  If you are a schoolteacher, if you are a U.S. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1040.74s)]
*  military member and you are a woman and a Trump supporter, then to Mark Cuban, you [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1043.3s)]
*  are stupid and weak. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1047.54s)]
*  It's a disgrace. And Kamala Harris stays silent. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1049.42s)]
*  Cuban's words are mean, sad and misogynistic. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1053.14s)]
*  And just a hunch. But I bet on Election Day, strong, smart women will remember. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1058.46s)]
*  And I'm proud to join the millions of smart, intelligent women who will stand with [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1064.5800000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump this Tuesday. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1069.0600000000002s)]
*  So this election is all about turnout. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1070.74s)]
*  All right. Who can get people to the polls? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1073.14s)]
*  And I'm sorry, all of these comments that's been happening in the middle of early [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1075.98s)]
*  vote leading up to Election Day are only firing people on the right to show up for [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1080.66s)]
*  the former president. You cannot want you. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1087.8600000000001s)]
*  You cannot think this is a good thing if you're in the Kamala Harris camp, that all [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1091.18s)]
*  these people are fired up, trash, not intelligent. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1095.98s)]
*  And all of these people are going to be going to the polls as a result. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1099.94s)]
*  You know, Lawrence, I think that today, if she does make herself available at all, it's [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1102.78s)]
*  going to be the same as two days ago. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1106.42s)]
*  She's going to be cleaning up for Joe Biden. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1107.9s)]
*  Today, she's going to be asked to define what you think a strong woman is. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1109.8600000000001s)]
*  And you believe that we put that Donald Trump is afraid to put strong women around [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1113.78s)]
*  him. Well, at the same time, they're boring. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1117.5s)]
*  Let's talk about Donald Trump. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1119.1000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris and her campaign were attacking Donald Trump yesterday because Donald Trump [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1120.46s)]
*  said he would protect American women, whether they like it or not. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1125.58s)]
*  And then also the comment where R.F.K. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1129.38s)]
*  Jr. would be involved in women's health in the administration. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1131.74s)]
*  And the Kamala Harris campaign are putting both those things out at the same time [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1135.9s)]
*  saying, hey, this is all bad for women. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1140.9s)]
*  Two days ago, it was all about trash. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1143.66s)]
*  Yesterday was all about gender. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1145.26s)]
*  You're right, though. Every single vote counts. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1146.9s)]
*  If you look at the Marist College poll this morning, Trump is 49 percent and Harris is [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1148.8200000000002s)]
*  at 49 percent. Real clear politics average, which is the average of all the polls. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1153.18s)]
*  Trump has forty nine point four and she has forty six point seven. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1158.46s)]
*  Steve, your initial point is is totally in your chronicle and get accurately from her [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1162.18s)]
*  perspective. Right. But it's almost like the Charlottesville statement. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1168.14s)]
*  A hundred percent took a half of a statement. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1170.74s)]
*  What he's trying to say is I'll protect women against illegal immigrant criminals. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1173.66s)]
*  And they said, I'm going to tell whether they want me to or not. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1178.74s)]
*  Referring to his staff said, don't bring this up. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1181.46s)]
*  He was bringing it up. So if you play the whole thing out, it's actually would belong. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1183.74s)]
*  It has nothing to do with a boy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1187.74s)]
*  If you take a half the sentence, it belongs in a Harris. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1189.06s)]
*  Both sides. My point was both sides have something that they're yelling at each other about. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1192.3799999999999s)]
*  And yesterday it was about accurate and one's inaccurate. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmMzwvwAL8&t=1197.78s)]
