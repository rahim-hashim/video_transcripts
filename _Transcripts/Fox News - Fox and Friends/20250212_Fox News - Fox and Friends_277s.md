# Only Elon Musk has been able to expose this: Miranda Devine
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw)
*  The people voted for major government reform and that's what people are going to get. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=0.0s)]
*  We got elected to, among other things, find all of this fraud, abuse, all of this horrible [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=7.44s)]
*  stuff going on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=14.22s)]
*  And when you get down to it, it's going to be probably close to a trillion dollars. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=15.46s)]
*  And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say, we don't want you to do that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=19.88s)]
*  So President Trump and Elon Musk shredding bureaucracy, laying the groundwork for large-scale [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=24.22s)]
*  government cuts, bringing total transparency back to Washington. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=28.659999999999997s)]
*  This is a complete 180 from Biden's constant refusal to answer reporters' questions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=32.66s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=36.5s)]
*  I'm not supposed to take any questions, but go ahead. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=37.5s)]
*  Mr. President, on Afghanistan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=40.22s)]
*  I'm not going to answer Afghanistan now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=42.62s)]
*  Infrastructure, sir. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  And in particular, on the people. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=45.099999999999994s)]
*  You guys are bad. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  I'm not supposed to be answering all these questions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=47.099999999999994s)]
*  I'm supposed to leave. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  I'm supposed to stop and walk out of the room here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  With a reaction, New York Post, columns Miranda Levine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  Miranda, good morning to you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=57.02s)]
*  I was struck by there was a moment in the press conference where Elon Musk says, look, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  because they were talking about the condoms and all that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=64.58s)]
*  And they said he said, look, we're going to make some mistakes, but we're not going to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=67.02000000000001s)]
*  bat 100. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=71.9s)]
*  But at least we're going to get to the transparency aspect of things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=72.9s)]
*  I think that was truly telling, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=76.86s)]
*  It sure was, Lawrence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=81.98s)]
*  I think it's so refreshing to see, you know, just that moment yesterday when you had Elon [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=83.06s)]
*  Musk and his cute little son in the Oval Office and Donald Trump sitting at the resolute desk [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=89.54s)]
*  just watching on as his kind of protege tells the entire world what he's been up to, that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=96.54s)]
*  nobody else, no other president, there have been other presidents that have tried to do [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=105.7s)]
*  this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=110.62s)]
*  Only Elon Musk and his little team of whiz kids, you know, very high IQ whiz kids have [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  been able to actually figure out what the government spends its money on and how it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=118.26s)]
*  spends it and how it wastes it, the corruption, the abuse of the taxpayer money. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that he's saying that he could save a trillion dollars is truly amazing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=131.94s)]
*  And this is something that we are seeing open up in real time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=139.06s)]
*  And you know, Elon has just discovered this stuff. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=143.22s)]
*  He's obviously come in to tell the president about it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  He's in there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=149.5s)]
*  He was in there last Friday. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=150.5s)]
*  He's obviously in there quite a lot. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=152.22s)]
*  And Donald Trump really enjoys it, finds it very interesting and also very important. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=154.38s)]
*  And Elon Musk has told him that this is the most important thing he thinks he will do. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=161.42s)]
*  He's basically neglected all his companies to come and spend 24-7 for no money, not that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=167.7s)]
*  he needs it, being the richest man in the world, but to do the business for the American [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  people and to see it all happening in real time, as you say, is such an incredible departure [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=181.82s)]
*  from what we saw under Joe Biden, who, you know, Joe Biden and his administration felt [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=189.74s)]
*  that the American people deserved no information. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=196.42s)]
*  And for some reason, the media went along with it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=200.54s)]
*  Yeah, Miranda, no one has been able to explain to me, what is Elon gaining from this? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=203.5s)]
*  He doesn't need the money. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't need the PR. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=210.38s)]
*  He doesn't need the power. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=212.06s)]
*  He doesn't need any of it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=213.06s)]
*  I think he's a god. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=215.82s)]
*  The headaches. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=216.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=217.82s)]
*  I think this is a god who loves projects and taking on things that people say cannot be [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=218.82s)]
*  done. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=224.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=225.06s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=226.82s)]
*  I think he loves a project. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=228.66s)]
*  But I also think, I mean, he's an immigrant to this country from South Africa, and he [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=230.5s)]
*  really does seem to love America with a huge passion. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=236.02s)]
*  And I guess as a businessman, and obviously a very successful one with several businesses, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=240.62s)]
*  he sees how dysfunctional this place has become. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  And so he wants to fix it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad about it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=254.94s)]
*  And we got a little ticker on the right so our audience can follow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=255.94s)]
*  You can see how much you're saving every single day. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=258.7s)]
*  And it's going to be updated throughout the day as they find more information. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=261.42s)]
*  Miranda Devine, thank you so much for joining the program. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xq1jBtYQw&t=265.14s)]
