# NEW: Mexico extradites 29 cartel leaders to US
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc)
*  to a Fox News lawyer today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=0.0s)]
*  Two of the 29 cartel members who were just extradited to the US from Mexico, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=3.48s)]
*  including one accused of killing a DEA agent back in 1985, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=8.88s)]
*  will appear in a New York court today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Shanley Painter is here with all the details for us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=15.52s)]
*  Shanley. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=17.92s)]
*  Hey, good morning. So at least two of those defendants will be [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  arraigned today in Brooklyn Federal Court, according to Reuters, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=21.56s)]
*  including a drug lord who is alleged to have been [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=25.2s)]
*  among those responsible for the murder of a US DEA agent, Enrique Kiki Camara, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  in 1985. This comes as Mexico on Thursday handed over 29 high profile [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=33.8s)]
*  drug cartel members to the United States as part of an unprecedented extradition. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=39.24s)]
*  As the Trump administration ramps up pressure on drug trafficking [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  organizations, illegal immigration and fentanyl production, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=47.72s)]
*  according to prosecutors, the prisoners face charges related to drug trafficking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=51.16s)]
*  and in some cases homicide, among other crimes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=56.28s)]
*  And among them are members of five of the six Mexican organized crime groups [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  designated earlier this month as foreign terrorist organizations by [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=65.08s)]
*  the Trump administration, guys. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Shanley, thank you very much. So keep in mind, we heard from the president [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=71.8s)]
*  yesterday that the tariffs are coming and we're going to talk about that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=75.32s)]
*  throughout the morning. They're going to come down hard on Mexico to the tune of 25 percent. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=79.08s)]
*  And when Mexico heard about it, he started negotiating with the president, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=84.2s)]
*  Scheinbaum, down in Mexico. So what does she do? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=88.28s)]
*  Just a couple of days before the tariffs are supposed to go into effect, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=90.84s)]
*  she releases these extradite into the United States, these 29 jail cartel members, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=94.04s)]
*  including somebody who is at the top of the most wanted list for 40 years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=100.2s)]
*  She also is pulling out all the stops, they say. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=105.08s)]
*  This is Mexico's point of view. They've arrested more than 400 people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=108.76s)]
*  since February after she announced that they were going to send 10,000 troops to the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=112.12s)]
*  northern border for them. They've seized 12 tons of narcotics, coke, meth, and 120 pounds of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  methamphetamines and fentanyl. It's all about trying to keep those [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=124.12s)]
*  tariffs from happening, but they're happening on Tuesday. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=129.0s)]
*  Yeah, Donald Trump's going to hold them accountable. He wants this to end. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=132.52s)]
*  He wants them to protect the borders. He wants them to stop allowing individuals, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=135.4s)]
*  especially cartel members, people bringing fentanyl over, trafficking children across the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=139.96s)]
*  border. But the cartel can't be happy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=144.68s)]
*  I mean, Mexico is a narco state, and now because of the president's pressure, their number one [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=146.84s)]
*  enterprise, which is getting the people across the border, people pay tens of thousands of dollars [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=153.4s)]
*  to get across the border. That has been totally disrupted. Now you have the Mexican president [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=158.52s)]
*  turning over the bosses because just because they're in jail doesn't mean they're not running [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=163.72s)]
*  the criminal enterprise from jail as well. And their tunnels are being sealed with concrete. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=167.72s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty much all maximum pressure against the cartel, Brian. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=173.4s)]
*  Yeah, two of the leaders are from a now defunct cartel. They've been in prison that long. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=177.88s)]
*  There were cartel leaders, security chiefs from both factions of the Sinaloa cartel, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=183.64s)]
*  including their finance operatives. Because guess what happens when they're here? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=188.44s)]
*  We get to talk to them, and we get to interrogate them. We get to unwind them, and we say, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=192.6s)]
*  we can use their conditions as a way of getting them to talk. And it also goes to show those [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=197.24s)]
*  people that are now out and functioning in Mexico, this is what you're looking at. Retribution [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=201.96s)]
*  American style. You're going to be extradited out here. You're not going to have a cushy situation [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  where the cartels, some would say, are more powerful than the government. So this is almost an out for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=211.96s)]
*  the president of Mexico, perhaps to get control of their country for the first time in decades. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=217.4s)]
*  That's right. You're going to be in a box for 23 hours out of the day, no windows. And you may [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  get some sunlight for 45 minutes a day. That can get people to talk. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=225.32s)]
*  Well, so she's trying to make nice with Trump. It's not going to work because he's going to still [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=230.12s)]
*  levy those tariffs on them. But what impressed me is just the fact that the DEA has had this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=234.44s)]
*  picture of this agent who was murdered by this guy, murdered in 1985 up on the wall. And they've [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=241.4s)]
*  been looking for this particular guy. This particular kingpin was convicted down in Mexico, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=246.92s)]
*  and he was supposed to serve 40 years in prison. But then in 2012, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=253.32s)]
*  inexplicably, suddenly he's out. He was recaptured 10 years later, and we've been waiting to get our [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=257.48s)]
*  hands on him. And now we've got him. And you saw the video of him landing in New York City [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=263.88s)]
*  yesterday. Nothing certain in the tariff world. It could change at any moment. We're a truth social [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=268.52s)]
*  post away. It's a negotiation. And I like that we continue to get stuff as he uses it as a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=274.12s)]
*  negotiation tool. Right. The problem with the negotiation is it scares the living [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=281.16s)]
*  daylights out of Wall Street. Wall Street went a little south yesterday, but then again, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  he could say something and it'll go straight up today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLj9XT2yLc&t=289.32000000000005s)]
