# 'GREEN SCAM IS OVER': Wyoming senator touts Trump's nuclear energy EO
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8)
*  Oh, President Trump's agenda hanging in the balance as the Senate gets ready to take up his big beautiful bill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=0.0s)]
*  Some sticking points with the bill from within his own party include Medicare reforms, clean energy, and the debt ceiling, and salt cap, to name a few. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=6.0s)]
*  So does it have the votes it needs to pass in the Senate? We've got the perfect guest to ask, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=15.0s)]
*  So just off camera I said, is it going to pass? And he said, we'll get it done. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=23.0s)]
*  So what will be some of the challenges as you get it done? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, I'd like to get it done as quickly as possible so the American people can see the benefits. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=31.0s)]
*  And we promised the American people, we want to get the country back on track. Here we are at the Indy 500. People understand what that means. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=36.0s)]
*  We promised safety and prosperity. So that means stopping this $4 trillion tax increase, which would hit every working family in America. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=43.0s)]
*  It means more money in people's pockets, more money to spend or to save or to buy groceries, all of those things. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=52.0s)]
*  So those are the things that are critical. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=57.0s)]
*  Well, there's always, we will get it done. I'm not going to go through each of the specific details, but we are all committed to the House of Representatives. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=59.0s)]
*  You don't want us to know how the sausage is made. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=66.0s)]
*  Right. It's not worth looking at. We know we've got to get this. We promised the president we will get it done. Congratulations to the House of Representatives for getting it done. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=68.0s)]
*  So we watched and saw what some of the sticking points were there, and I'm assuming that it's not going to go through the Senate unscathed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=78.0s)]
*  Where do you think some of the changes are going to be in the Senate? And then will those changes, do you think, wind up being acceptable when it goes back to the House? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=86.0s)]
*  Yes. One, we need to make sure the border is secure. The president was elected to secure the border, number one. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=97.0s)]
*  Number two, we need to make sure we get rid of so much of this waste, fraud and abuse that we're seeing in the government. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=103.0s)]
*  This has been found out by the groups that are looking into this right now. So we're continuing to work through that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=109.0s)]
*  We need a strong military, a strong defense. That went away over the last four years. Tomorrow's Memorial Day. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=117.0s)]
*  I'll be in Wyoming at a cemetery with our Gold Star families. People want to make sure that we are a strong nation from the standpoint of energy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=123.0s)]
*  We need all of the energy. And Biden put a lot of money on bad things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=131.0s)]
*  You know, just last week, we blocked the Democrats from going out the door. They said no more gas powered cars in America. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=135.0s)]
*  Can you imagine they wanted to by law force people into buying electric vehicles? We were able to stop all of that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=142.0s)]
*  The Indy 500 with EVs would not be the same. Not a 10 second pit stop. No, you're not going to be a two day race until they recharge the batteries. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=149.0s)]
*  You know, Senator, you mentioned energy and President Trump announcing that his administration will pursue nuclear energy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=156.0s)]
*  Listen here. I think we have a sound bite of that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=163.0s)]
*  We have a very big announcement today that has to do with nuclear energy and other things. And this is all nuclear. It's a hot industry. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=167.0s)]
*  It's a brilliant industry. You have to do it right. It's become very safe and environmental. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=176.0s)]
*  We'll be second to none because we're starting very strong. But we it's time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=182.0s)]
*  It's time for nuclear and we're going to do it very big. Just your thoughts on that, Senator. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=188.0s)]
*  Well, number one, never again can we be dependent on Russia or China for nuclear material or anything related to energy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=193.0s)]
*  The president is absolutely right. We need to be uranium here. The next generation nuclear power plants here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=200.0s)]
*  We need all of the energy. I'm from Wyoming, the breadbasket of American energy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=207.0s)]
*  We're building that next generation of nuclear power plant. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=211.0s)]
*  But additionally, in the fight for AI against China, you need massive amounts of energy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=215.0s)]
*  And the Biden administration really put our head in a noose the last four years by telling the EPA prioritize climate over energy that's available, affordable or reliable. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=220.0s)]
*  President Trump is focusing on energy dominance. Last week, last month, I was with him in the White House. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=230.0s)]
*  He signed an executive order on coal. We need all of the energy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=236.0s)]
*  When President Trump rightly says energy security is national security, he knows what he's talking about. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=240.0s)]
*  This is and you guys just did the story. What energy gas? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=247.0s)]
*  Fifty cents cheaper right now. A gallon that it was a year ago. The lowest, did you say, on labor? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=250.0s)]
*  Four years. Yeah, that's what this administration is doing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=256.0s)]
*  That's what a united Republican Party is doing to get down prices, increase wages, to bring jobs back home. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=259.0s)]
*  And what this EO is going to bring nuclear energy jobs back to America. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=266.0s)]
*  Amazing. We shall see. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=270.0s)]
*  Well, Senator John Barrasso, thank you so much. And thanks for reminding us the days of the of the green scam are over. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=272.0s)]
*  Thanks for all a reminder of how important it is that Trump and Republicans managed to win the Senate. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=279.0s)]
*  So, yeah, thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=284.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=285.0s)]
*  Enjoy the race. It's going to be magnificent. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=286.0s)]
*  Do you have a favor, by the way? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=288.0s)]
*  Well, you're going to have Helio on. He'd be 50 running for 50 years old running for his fourth. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=289.0s)]
*  I was with Joseph Newgardner last night. He's running for three in a row. You had what? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=293.0s)]
*  Paddle O'Rourke one yesterday and Alex Palo. I mean, this is anybody can win this race. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=297.0s)]
*  You have some of the fastest drivers starting in the rear. It's going to be an exciting one for history. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=302.0s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=307.0s)]
*  Sure is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=308.0s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY0e-kgwPR8&t=315.0s)]
