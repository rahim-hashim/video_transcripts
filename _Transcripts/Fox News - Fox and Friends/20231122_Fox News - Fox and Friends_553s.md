*  Coming back as soon as possible [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=186.3s)]
*  Absolutely, and I remember talking to you I've read a couple weeks ago [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=189.26s)]
*  and you were telling me about your aunt and uncle and that your aunt makes the best cheesecake in the world and your uncle makes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=192.22s)]
*  his own wine and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=198.7s)]
*  Your cousin and her daughters are so beautiful [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=200.9s)]
*  So little and maybe they will be in that first 50 because you know we're hearing that it's gonna be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=203.74s)]
*  Women and children so we are all keeping your family members and gilly years as well in our prayers gilly ask this next question to you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=210.26s)]
*  If this goes through and the first 50 are released [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=217.98s)]
*  What's next there? This is about one-fifth of the hostages being held [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=222.14s)]
*  What do you hope to see happen to the future in the future of Gaza? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  And what about the other 200 that are still being held hostage? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=230.66s)]
*  So so first firstly it's important to understand that this deal also includes in itself in itself [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  Possible continuation of the deal so if Hamas will [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=244.14s)]
*  Come forward and say that they can find and release more hostages [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=248.26s)]
*  They can get a day per 10 hostages [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=253.1s)]
*  So I really hope to see a long continuation of this deal and to see dozens of hostages are being released even after these four days [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=256.7s)]
*  This is one aspect and we really hope to see as many as possible all children and women which are included in this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=265.38s)]
*  Broader deal afterwards. We hopefully want to see new deals [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=271.94s)]
*  That will extend the scope of release also to all of our men and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=278.26s)]
*  Soldiers until the last one of them. Yeah, he fret [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=285.3s)]
*  You know, obviously we're keeping you all in our prayers right now. We hope everything goes well with the hostage situation [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  But the international community as a whole has not been very supportive of Israel [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  Even the UN and the war is gonna continue after this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=302.26s)]
*  So I guess my question to you if you have the opportunity [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=307.18s)]
*  And people are watching this all over the world right now to talk to the international community about your country [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=310.78s)]
*  What would you tell them? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=317.58s)]
*  First I do you want to say that we get a lot of support and we're very very grateful and here you are [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=320.38s)]
*  Interviewing us and we're very grateful for that. The public opinion is a surely very important [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=327.06s)]
*  And I do think that it's a global problem. The terrorism is a global problem, and I think that everybody must remember that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  We are here to support our beloved ones [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=343.06s)]
*  But there are many questions that the global community has to ask itself [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=347.42s)]
*  for future [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=354.18s)]
*  But our concern now is here and now and today we want to see them back now and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=356.74s)]
*  That's that's the main issue now. Yeah [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=363.7s)]
*  Please keep us in your news and in your thoughts [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=367.94s)]
*  and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=372.5s)]
*  talk to your [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=373.62s)]
*  Senators and governments and I think that we're should be all united in order to release them [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=375.46s)]
*  Right, and if we if I can just ask you a quick Gilly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=383.26s)]
*  The good news is regardless if you're your loved ones in the first batch to come out [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=387.14s)]
*  They'll have things to say and stories to say is their arrangements made so you'll be able to interact [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=392.3s)]
*  Once the hostages come out so you could try to get some answers the family doesn't have to use a go-between [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=398.26s)]
*  Yeah, so for for your prior question [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=405.5s)]
*  I really want to say that it's crucial for the UN to understand that Israel and Israel is like any other nation in the world [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  Has the right to defend its citizens? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=416.74s)]
*  Otherwise, there is no reason for us to have a state [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=420.06s)]
*  There is no reason to have a nation if it cannot protect its own people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=422.58s)]
*  And I think that the double standard that we are facing it's unacceptable and what we are going through as human beings. It's unacceptable [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=427.82s)]
*  As for your question. Yes, there is a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  procedure I just [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=438.58s)]
*  Got off the phone with the officer that is communicating with us regularly and there's a more [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=440.46s)]
*  Regularly organized process of how we will be able to communicate [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=446.66s)]
*  And how our loved one will be taken care of and we are really hopeful and waiting to see this process [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=452.1s)]
*  In practice already [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely, we hope that your family members come back to you safely [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=461.62s)]
*  You are in the prayers of so many people here in the United States our closest as ally in the Middle East and one of our [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=465.1s)]
*  Most important allies in the world Israel. Thank you so much both for joining us [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=473.06s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thank you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=478.5s)]
*  I hope he'll be on again soon with with the hostages with everybody out [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=480.5s)]
*  What a powerful message he said he said that there is a double standard [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=484.34s)]
*  Of course when it comes to Israel doesn't have a right to defend themselves [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=487.38s)]
*  They still haven't voted to condemn the attack on October 7 condemnation [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=490.66s)]
*  And I just hope they realize that Hamas uses their inaction as a letdown [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=495.02s)]
*  Uses their inaction as leverage against the Israeli people. I mean when they say that there's both sides [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=500.62s)]
*  I'm so sick of hearing that fake phrase by the way as if there is some type of parallel [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=507.66s)]
*  To what's happening in the Palestinian Authority and what happened to Israel on October the 7th? There's no justification [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=512.1s)]
*  I just love to see the reporting sarcastically. They don't trust anything that comes from Israel. Israel says this but Hamas says [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=518.58s)]
*  Whatever. Yeah, but Israel. Yeah, there are Israel says his tunnels and that doesn't look like a tunnel and that's a ladder [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=524.62s)]
*  But we'll see and one of the most important things is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=529.94s)]
*  Hamas knew what Israel's reaction would be if they launched a terror attack of the size and scale that they did and it would be [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=532.9s)]
*  That Israel would fight back and it would mean dead Palestinians and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=539.7s)]
*  Here militants have said that that was their hope to get the whole Muslim and Arab world against Israel [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=543.38s)]
*  So part of the plan was dead Palestinians [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpkkGOdgsI&t=550.0s)]
