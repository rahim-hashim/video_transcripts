# China launches new retaliation in Trump trade war: report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE)
*  Beijing is escalating the trade battle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=0.0s)]
*  This kids came across with the US as it reportedly orders Chinese airlines to stop taking deliveries [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=1.86s)]
*  of Boeing planes and to not buy the aircraft related equipment from American companies. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=8.98s)]
*  This comes as President Trump considers a pause on car tariffs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=15.84s)]
*  Jackie Heinrich is live at White House with all the details for you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Hey Jackie. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Hey good morning to you guys. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  Bloomberg is reporting this morning that China has ordered its airlines to halt deliveries [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  of Boeing jets and all aircraft related parts, causing shares of the company to drop 4.6 [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=32.12s)]
*  percent in pre-market trading. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  That followed the announcement. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  This order will block about 10 747 MAX airline jets from entering Chinese fleets. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=42.84s)]
*  China's retaliatory tariff of 125 percent on American goods made purchases impractical, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=50.8s)]
*  more than doubling the cost, according to this report. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=56.48s)]
*  Meantime, Beijing is looking for ways to assist the Chinese airlines that lease the Boeing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=59.36s)]
*  jets. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  This news comes as President Trump is announcing he's considering a pause for auto tariffs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  Last week he said no such exceptions were under consideration, but he also cautioned [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=70.32s)]
*  that he will stay flexible. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=74.32s)]
*  I'm looking at something to help some of the car companies where they're switching to parts [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=76.72s)]
*  that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places and they need a little bit of time [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=82.52s)]
*  because they're going to make them here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=88.12s)]
*  But they need a little bit of time so I'm talking about things like that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=90.24s)]
*  NEC Director Kevin Hassett said on Kudlow yesterday the U.S. has solid trade deal offers [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=93.52s)]
*  from about 10 countries, but the real number is north of 10. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  The offers just aren't quite there yet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=102.36s)]
*  Meantime, the White House is preparing a rescission package to codify Doge cuts. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  Among the items on the chopping block, half the State Department and USAID budgets, slashing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=109.96s)]
*  $26 billion in programs that promote democracy, support cultural institutions and aid multinational [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=115.16s)]
*  institutions, that's according to Politico. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=120.44s)]
*  Plus, the New York Post is reporting billions in federal funding for NPR and PBS is also [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=122.52s)]
*  on the chopping block. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=128.4s)]
*  OMB Director Russ Vogt saying, quote, since day one the Trump administration has targeted [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=129.64s)]
*  waste, fraud and abuse in federal spending through executive action, Doge review and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  other efforts by departments and agencies. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=137.88s)]
*  Congress has expressed strong interest in supporting these efforts and requested the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  administration transmit rescissions to the Hill for swift approval. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=143.84s)]
*  Now formally transmitting these cuts from the White House will start that 45 day clock [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=148.28s)]
*  for the House and Senate to approve or reject the blueprint. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=153.44s)]
*  According to the New York Post, the White House thinks that this package of rescissions [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=157.96s)]
*  will pass, guys. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=162.28s)]
*  But you know what I'm shocked at, Jackie? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=164.08s)]
*  That it's just $9.5 billion. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=166.36s)]
*  Like we have, I thought we saved a minimum $250 billion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=168.12s)]
*  Why start so low? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we've got to go back actually and look at the numbers because there are conflicting [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=173.16s)]
*  stats in the Politico reporting and the NPR reporting. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=177.24s)]
*  It looks like the NPR, or the, excuse me, New York Post reporting includes cuts to NPR [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  and PBS as well as $8. something billion for the State Department while the Politico reporting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  puts the State Department and USAID cuts at $26, which would include the $8 that's referenced [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=191.6s)]
*  in the New York Post. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=197.72s)]
*  So we're trying to get a solid number. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=198.8s)]
*  Our reporting is that the White House has passed a rescission package, but we're trying [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=201.76s)]
*  to nail down exactly what that number is, guys. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=205.28s)]
*  Alright, thanks so much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=207.68s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=209.28s)]
*  So it's a pretty big deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=210.28s)]
*  I mean, they cut off the rare earth. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=211.52s)]
*  We should be getting it from them anyway. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=213.36s)]
*  Why we're, depending on them for everything. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=216.44s)]
*  And the other thing is, we're bowling planes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=218.8s)]
*  We only got one other shot, Airbus. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=221.0s)]
*  So with either you want a Boeing or you want Airbus, but Airbus just can't replace something [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=223.28s)]
*  that takes time to produce, Lawrence. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=228.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be some pain here, Brian. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=232.2s)]
*  I mean, there's just no sugar coating it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=236.48s)]
*  I hate that it had to be this moment that we started doing manufacturing in our country [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=238.84s)]
*  because it seems like in many respects, we're just not prepared for it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=244.6s)]
*  I think the president can get some type of operation like Operation Warp Speed, where [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=248.72s)]
*  we start to produce at a massive scale. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=253.64s)]
*  But I also think that it's just very interesting, as I made the point yesterday, that China [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=256.52s)]
*  is willing to stop planes when they didn't want to stop the planes when there was a pandemic [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=261.2s)]
*  going on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=265.8s)]
*  They could have notified the world. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=266.8s)]
*  If China wants to get into action, they're showing that they can do it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=268.44s)]
*  I just hope we're ready for this fight. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=272.64s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people, and I'm going to be talking with diners later on today, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=274.08s)]
*  to support the president because they feel like this is the patriotic thing to do, to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=278.12s)]
*  make your bill here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  And they feel like it's a safety issue for our country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=284.0s)]
*  Lawrence, two things. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=286.68s)]
*  Yesterday, Walmart said that they looked at their first earnings report for 2025. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  No negative effect from these tariffs. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=293.56s)]
*  70 percent of their goods are made in America. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=295.4s)]
*  And that's what Trump's trying to do for industries. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=297.36s)]
*  He's listening to the car industry. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=299.12s)]
*  They're saying, can you rethink this? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=300.96s)]
*  Can you pause this for just a little bit? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  And he's listening to the people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  We, you know, a lot of people out in America, they love this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=307.0s)]
*  Everywhere we go, people are saying they love it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=310.48s)]
*  Trump did sit down with Rachel Campos Duffy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  She asked him something that he said no one has ever asked him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=315.04s)]
*  Could the tariff money, could it replace our income taxes so that we wouldn't have to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=318.32s)]
*  pay taxes? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  ¿Van a reemplazar el income tax? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, you're the only one that's asked me that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=327.76s)]
*  Oh, I deal with all these big financial geniuses nobody ever has. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=330.0s)]
*  There is a chance that the money from tariffs could be so great that it would replace, you [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=334.36s)]
*  know, in the old days, 18, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=338.44s)]
*  And that's when our nation was relatively the richest. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=348.48s)]
*  We were the richest. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=351.8s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=352.8s)]
*  You'll be able to see Rachel's full interview with the president. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=353.8s)]
*  It drops today, 4 o'clock on Fox Noticias. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  And she's got the interview. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=360.52s)]
*  You know, and in talking, Lawrence, you made a good point. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=361.68s)]
*  There's going to be some pain because of a variety of reasons. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=366.08s)]
*  But we know big multinational companies like Boeing and the car companies, they've got [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=371.32s)]
*  plans to weather it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=378.88s)]
*  The New York Post today, their cover story is Mr. Trump saved my business. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=380.6s)]
*  And what it talks about is how many mom and pop shops across the United States are in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=385.24s)]
*  really big trouble. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=392.04s)]
*  Small businesses account for one third of all American imports. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=393.44s)]
*  All the stuff that comes into the country goes to small businesses. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=398.6s)]
*  And right now, a lot of the small businesses are having to either lay off people or hike [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=401.56s)]
*  their prices or close. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=405.72s)]
*  And they're just not equipped. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=408.6s)]
*  So the Post highlights a bunch of small businesses that are on the verge of going under. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=410.84s)]
*  And it after a week, well, after a while, the New York Post, the editorial says, Mr. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=416.08s)]
*  President, be careful because you are well insulated from the financial shocks. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  They have no clue about how the surcharges are clobbering small business owners and their [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=427.2s)]
*  patrons. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=432.55999999999995s)]
*  So while a big company has got deep pockets, it's the people who are living paycheck to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  paycheck as a small business operator that are really feeling the pain. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  A lot of them voted for Trump. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=443.8s)]
*  A lot of them want the tariffs to work. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=445.24s)]
*  But right now, it just hurts. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=447.08s)]
*  But it's projected pain because, I mean, we're talking about something that happened four [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  days ago, you know, one week ago, or, you know, depending on, and the president's phase [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=452.0s)]
*  other things in. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=457.22s)]
*  The other thing is the president's doing exactly what he said he was going to do. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=458.48s)]
*  He said he's got to reconfigure all his relationships. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=461.48s)]
*  He said 10 came in with strong deals yesterday. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=463.88s)]
*  Also that big story about Nvidia, Lawrence, the chip maker announced it would produce [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=466.88s)]
*  supercomputers for artificial intelligence entirely in the U.S. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=472.04s)]
*  That might be the number one company in the world. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=476.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's actually talk with some of the people about that, Brian, because I think [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=478.4s)]
*  this tariff thing, we're so outside of the bubble sometimes that we miss what the American [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=484.2s)]
*  people are talking about. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=489.28s)]
*  Let's go talk with some folks here. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=491.52s)]

*  Jim. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=502.44s)]
*  Okay, so I've been talking with folks about this tariff issue. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=503.44s)]
*  Some people feel like we need to take the power back from these other countries. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  We need some fairness. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  And some people feel like we're going to have some pain. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  Where do you stand? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=515.4s)]
*  Do you support the president's plan here? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=516.4s)]
*  Or are you concerned? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=519.04s)]

*  And we have to, we voted for him. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  We have to support him. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=527.04s)]
*  What about you, sir? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=528.52s)]
*  Where do you stand? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=530.24s)]
*  I think one of the things that we always ask is why we're going to leave our children. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=531.24s)]
*  And I think that this is something that shouldn't have been decades ago. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=536.04s)]
*  So this is something that we're going to leave our children, leave our children a better [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=538.84s)]
*  economy than we have right now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=541.8s)]

*  No, I'm not concerned. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=565.84s)]
*  I have full faith in our president. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=567.44s)]
*  We support him 100%. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=569.36s)]
*  Is this what he campaigned on, that he was going to go after these, make America great [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=571.24s)]

*  Absolutely stand behind the president. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=580.5200000000001s)]

*  And you know, you got to say that may be rough the next few weeks, but we'll get through [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=589.2800000000001s)]

*  tariff policy. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UWezN_mCE&t=613.04s)]
