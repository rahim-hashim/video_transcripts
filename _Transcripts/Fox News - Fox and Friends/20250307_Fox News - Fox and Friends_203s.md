# Trump wants 'answers' on assassination attempts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco)
*  Meanwhile, Trump assassination attempt. Let's talk about it. The suspect Ryan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=0.0s)]
*  Ruth is due in court this morning. Griff Jenkins has all the details for us. Hey [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=4.76s)]
*  Griff. Well good morning guys and the boss wants an update on both [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=10.4s)]
*  assassination attempts on his life as Florida suspect Ryan Ruth, the 59 year [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=14.24s)]
*  old convicted felon, remember arrested near Trump's Palm Beach golf course while [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=19.2s)]
*  armed, is due in a Florida courtroom this morning around 11 a.m. and President [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=23.56s)]
*  Trump says he's open to making some of this information public. I want to find [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=28.56s)]
*  the answers I've told them. When you have three apps and two of them are foreign [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=33.32s)]
*  and you had an FBI that wouldn't report on her, they didn't want to say why, I [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=36.8s)]
*  would say that could be suspicious. The second one he had six cell phones, that's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=42.96s)]
*  a lot of cell phones. I want to find out and I would be willing to release it. I [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=48.92s)]
*  mean that maybe there's a reason that we shouldn't so I don't want to get too far [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=52.72s)]
*  ahead of my skis but yeah I wouldn't be very willing to release that. Although [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=56.84s)]
*  it's unclear whether the reporter information he might release will cover [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  one or both plots but recall Pennsylvania shooter Thomas Matthew [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=65.80000000000001s)]
*  Crooks is dead but multiple law enforcement sources tell Fox a motive [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  still has yet to be determined and unlike two months ago, President Trump [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  now has his own team at the DOJ, FBI and Secret Service in place so the flow of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  information is expected to be certainly more forthcoming. Now today's hearing is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=83.04s)]
*  in Fort Pierce, Florida. It's a status hearing ahead of Ruth's September trial [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=87.4s)]
*  with federal judge Eileen Cannon who oversaw Trump's classified documents [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=92.04s)]
*  case and who Ruth has already tried unsuccessfully to have removed. Now [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  today we expect there will be a bit of a tug-of-war between prosecutors and the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=101.0s)]
*  defense over scheduling and evidentiary discovery materials. We'll see what [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  happens guys. Right yeah there's a new sheriff in town running the FBI thanks [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=109.8s)]
*  so much Griff so I mean I have a ton of questions Kim and they weren't shooting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=113.88s)]
*  at me but why was that first shooters in Butler why was his apartment just [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  cleaned out almost immediately why have we heard nothing except for the parents [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=122.52s)]
*  caught when they were going to a parking garage who was he talking to who [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=126.06s)]
*  were they was on these encrypted apps have they even tried to break down what [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  was in it with his multiple cell phones? At its core it was way too easy [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=134.16s)]
*  it was way too easy for that first suspect to be able to do it. In both cases. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=139.04s)]
*  Exactly so someone has to explain to me how they how y'all he got how many rounds [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=143.2s)]
*  off at the President of the United States and it just doesn't seem like [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=148.6s)]
*  there's there's much interest in getting that done. But did he act alone? Exactly. And he has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=151.92s)]
*  more protection now because he's the President of the United States then he [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=157.88s)]
*  was running for office so hopefully you know he's very safe now but it's just [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=160.64s)]
*  crazy that these people think that they want to do this. How could you not be doing the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=165.64s)]
*  investigation? How could the FBI think there's anything more important than [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=170.11999999999998s)]
*  finding out who's trying to kill the president? Was Iran involved? They made it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=174.04s)]
*  clear they want to kill him. Were they involved? This guy Ryan Ruth why did he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=177.33999999999997s)]
*  have so many contacts? He's impoverished living in Squalor? Traveling around? Who's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=180.94s)]
*  paying those bills? We'll be covering that because we will hear more and we'll [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  get more information [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrTOK6tUco&t=189.88s)]
