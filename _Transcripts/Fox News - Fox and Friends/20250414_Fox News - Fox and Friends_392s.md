# 'FAKE NEWS': Kristi Noem blasts 'sickening' narrative on accused gang member's deportation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74)
*  So today, President Trump will host the president of El Salvador at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=0.0s)]
*  The two are expected to discuss Trump's push to deport criminal migrants like the ones [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=4.64s)]
*  the administration already sent to the mega prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=9.56s)]
*  Meantime, the Department of Justice says that the courts have no authority to order the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=13.56s)]
*  administration to return the deported Maryland man back to the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=17.68s)]
*  Joining us now, the Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Welcome, Madam Secretary. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for inviting me, Lawrence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=29.2s)]
*  So Madam Secretary, I'm enjoying this showdown because the Supreme Court essentially gave [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=30.8s)]
*  the courts some authority as it relates to coming up with an agreement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=34.92s)]
*  But it didn't say that the court could do foreign policy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=39.76s)]
*  In your latest filing, I found something very interesting from it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=44.24s)]
*  This is you, the plaint, this is you, your court filing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=48.6s)]
*  It says the plaintiff has invited the court to exceed its own authority in the precise [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=51.92s)]
*  sort of way the Supreme Court cautioned them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=56.88s)]
*  Again, this court should decline that invitation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=59.08s)]
*  So it's saying if you keep getting out of line, then we'll just let the Supreme Court [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=61.72s)]
*  deal with you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=65.66s)]
*  Is that y'all's position? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=66.66s)]
*  Yes, I think that what the Supreme Court said here in this decision was a very clear message [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=68.16s)]
*  to other judges across this country is that stop acting like you have the authority to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=73.16s)]
*  dictate foreign policy and national security decisions that the president is making to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=77.94s)]
*  protect its citizens. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=82.36s)]
*  So this was just one of those examples of an individual that was an MS-13 gang member, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  had multiple charges and encounters with the individuals here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=89.92s)]
*  Trafficking in his background was found with other MS-13 gang members. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=93.76s)]
*  Very dangerous person. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=97.56s)]
*  And what the liberal left and the fake news are doing to turn him into a media darling [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=99.12s)]
*  is sickening. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=103.48s)]
*  We need to stop doing this, stop allowing liberal judges to try to dictate what President [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump is doing to make America safe again. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=109.76s)]
*  So I'm grateful for the Supreme Court's decision and I'm hopeful that we can have a new path [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=112.6s)]
*  forward where the president and his powers are recognized. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  This judge has said that he wants daily updates. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=120.96s)]
*  Shouldn't we be focused on the updates of the American people on the day-to-day that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=126.28s)]
*  are being victimized by these criminal aliens? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=132.16s)]
*  That's what we get up every single day to make sure that we are doing, Lawrence. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=133.16s)]
*  It's amazing what President Trump has already done by closing down the border, making sure [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=139.12s)]
*  we're enforcing our federal laws, doing all we can to identify those that are in this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=144.12s)]
*  country that don't belong here, that are committing crimes, and we're continuing to enact policies [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  that will give us the chance to do that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  You've had quite a bit of discussion on Real ID and its implementation here in the country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=155.24s)]
*  And the reason that Real ID is being enforced is because it's a federal law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=160.32s)]
*  Joe Biden kicked the can to May 7th. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=164.84s)]
*  And this Real ID is going to just empower the states to make sure we're checking people's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=167.16s)]
*  residences, their current legal status will be verified. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=172.16s)]
*  We're going to make sure that people who are getting Social Security numbers in this country [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  aren't voting in states. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=179.6s)]
*  The states have the power and the information to ensure election integrity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=180.96s)]
*  And here at the federal level, that information is not going to be any biometric information. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=184.68s)]
*  It'll just allow people to get an ID that they should be on our planes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=189.76s)]
*  They should be people that are United States residencies and that legal status will be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=194.32s)]
*  checked. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=200.4s)]
*  So it'll allow us to get more information to states so that they're making sure that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=201.4s)]
*  they're protecting their election laws as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=205.76s)]
*  So Madam Secretary, what's the confusion on this? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=207.48s)]
*  Because I've heard some women say that this is very difficult for them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  I actually checked, apparently in the state of Texas, I already have a Real ID. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  I didn't even know it was given to me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=218.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting Lawrence. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=219.72s)]
*  Some of the most conservative states are the first ones to put it in place because they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=222.28s)]
*  recognize, you know, South Dakota was the first state to do it, Florida, Texas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=225.72s)]
*  We already have 81 percent compliance of all travelers already have a Real ID and already [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=229.8s)]
*  you just use it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  So that's why TSA is working so hard to educate people ahead of the deadline to get that other [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  small percentage educated so that it can be operated and put into place smoothly to ensure [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=242.58s)]
*  that people who are traveling in our country, that we know who they are, that they live [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=248.28s)]
*  here, that we know what their legal status is and that we can make sure we share that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=253.44s)]
*  information and states have that information. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=258.0s)]
*  We want the states to be compliant in this, which is a database that they have access [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=259.88s)]
*  to that the federal government doesn't use for any purposes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=264.2s)]
*  So Madam Secretary, Antonio Gracias, who works under Elon Musk, is reportedly going to lead [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=267.52s)]
*  the specialized Doge Immigration Task Force to help you develop some infrastructure within [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=272.44s)]
*  your department. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=278.44s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=279.68s)]
*  Well I've met Antonio and he's brilliant. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=281.92s)]
*  He's going to be working to make sure that individuals who got Social Security numbers [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=284.28s)]
*  in this country should be using them for the right things and they shouldn't be on our [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=289.8s)]
*  benefit programs. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=294.32s)]
*  You know, we have over 6,000 individuals that have been identified through their work already [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=295.96s)]
*  that have been on the terrorist watch list, that they are known criminals. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=301.4s)]
*  How does that happen, Madam Secretary? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=304.64s)]
*  It happens when you put a train wreck like Joe Biden in the White House and it's going [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=307.8s)]
*  to be a lot of work to clean it up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=311.2s)]
*  But just in the last four and a half years we've had over 9 million people get Social [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=312.8s)]
*  Security numbers that are not U.S. citizens. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=318.0s)]
*  So they may be people who have some sort of legal status, but a lot of them are illegals [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=321.28s)]
*  that were given a Social Security number in just the last four and a half years that we're [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=326.12s)]
*  going to have to figure out if they should be here, if they are here legally under a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=330.36s)]
*  program and if they are here illegally then they certainly shouldn't be using that Social [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=333.44s)]
*  Security number to be on our programs and they should be removed or given the opportunity [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=338.2s)]
*  to go home on their own. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=343.2s)]
*  That's the one thing President Trump would like, is everybody to be given the opportunity [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=344.2s)]
*  to go home if they would wish to. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=347.84s)]
*  And real quickly, I only got about 30 seconds, Madam Secretary. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=349.68s)]
*  This meeting between the El Salvadorian President and President Donald Trump, does that indicate [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  that the flights will continue, that the deportation, that you guys aren't going to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=356.68s)]
*  allow the courts to stop you? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=360.0s)]
*  Well, I think the conversation is going to be extremely beneficial. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=361.56s)]
*  El Salvador's been a fantastic partner and when I was in El Salvador visiting with President [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=364.96s)]
*  Bukele, we talked about the fact that he would accept more flights, would accept more individuals [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=369.0s)]
*  into CCOT. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=374.24s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to that partnership continuing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=375.24s)]
*  Secretary Kristi Noem, thank you so much for joining the program. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=378.12s)]
*  Yes, thank you, Lawrence. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=380.32s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=381.32s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=382.32s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1X7vA95_74&t=383.32s)]
