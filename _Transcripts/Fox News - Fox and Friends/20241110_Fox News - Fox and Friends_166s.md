# TROUBLE IN PARADISE?: Nancy Pelosi tears into Bernie Sanders for criticizing Dems
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY)
*  You know, one of the first people to speak up and say we need to have a reckoning about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=0.0s)]
*  what our party represents was Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist, presidential candidate, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=3.36s)]
*  pushed aside by the Democrats multiple times. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=8.76s)]
*  He came out on X on Wednesday, right after the election, talking about the working class. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  And he's gotten some blowback on that statement. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=16.04s)]
*  So here's what Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday after Kamala Harris was thumped. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=18.16s)]
*  He wrote, it should come as no great surprise that a Democrat party, which has abandoned [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  working class people, would find that the working class has abandoned them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=28.02s)]
*  First it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=32.54s)]
*  While the Democrat leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=36.58s)]
*  and want change and their right. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=39.72s)]
*  A lot of Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, taking some issue with this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=42.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=46.78s)]
*  Here's what she said after Bernie Sanders said that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=47.78s)]
*  With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him, for what he stands for, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=50.82s)]
*  but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic party has abandoned the working class families. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=56.62s)]
*  That's where we are. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=62.72s)]
*  For example, under President Biden, you see the rescue package, money in the pockets of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=63.72s)]
*  people, shots in the arm, children in school safely, working people back to work. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=71.22s)]
*  What's his name? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  What did Trump do when he was president? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  One bill that gave a tax cut to the richest people in America. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Then why did voters who earned less than $100,000 go for Trump in such large numbers? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=85.1s)]
*  Well, there are cultural issues involved in elections as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=92.5s)]
*  Guns are god and gays. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=96.3s)]
*  That's the way they say it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=97.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=99.66s)]
*  So, you're right, they're not going to come. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=100.66s)]
*  They're not learning. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=103.61999999999999s)]
*  They got shots in arms. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=104.61999999999999s)]
*  That's a direct shot. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  So she seizes a direct shot at her. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=106.61999999999999s)]
*  She is the Democratic party. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=108.38s)]
*  That's how she certainly sees it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=110.1s)]
*  And by the way, she has a ton of power, so she's not wrong. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=111.1s)]
*  You've already pointed out, we've now seen limitations in Barack Obama's power. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=114.78s)]
*  I actually think she is the most important figure in the Democratic party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=119.74s)]
*  And so when Bernie Sanders says that, yeah, I do, I think she has been. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=123.1s)]
*  I think it's going to start fading. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=127.18s)]
*  Well yeah, because she's old. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=128.9s)]
*  So when he insults the Democratic party, Bernie Sanders, he's insulting her is my point. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=132.58s)]
*  She has been the Democratic party. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=137.06s)]
*  So he says you turned away from the working class, she's like, I have not. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=139.54s)]
*  And then you saw her rattle off her things, including the shots in the arm. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=143.98s)]
*  Shots in the arm. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=146.42s)]
*  But you know, I saw Joy Behar on The View doing something similar. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=147.42s)]
*  What's going on in America? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=150.7s)]
*  Democrats are the party of the working class. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=152.26s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Used to be. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTGD13upxY&t=155.01999999999998s)]
