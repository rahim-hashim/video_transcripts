# Trump teases retaliation against Putin for stalling Ukraine peace talks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU)
*  All right, here we go. Elon Musk is set to visit the CIA today at the request of John [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=0.0s)]
*  Radcliffe, the director, to discuss the government efficiency at the Bureau. Our next guest has [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=5.24s)]
*  met with Musk a number of times since retiring from the CIA. Fox News contributor, former [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  CIA guy himself, Dan Hoffman. Dan, what could someone on the outside be working to do with [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=15.14s)]
*  the CIA on the inside, being that he's not an intelligence officer? How could they become [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=22.56s)]
*  more efficient? Well, I think first and foremost, if there's one thing I learned at CIA is that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=26.96s)]
*  the agency is really known for innovation. And really, Elon Musk is one of the most innovative [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=34.64s)]
*  entrepreneurs of his generation. And so I think you'll see some affinity there as they [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=41.72s)]
*  discuss their views of the world. It's a chance for CIA to brief up Elon Musk a little bit [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  on how they work, and I'm sure there'll be some closed-door meetings, and also a chance [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=52.12s)]
*  to discuss Elon Musk's vision for bringing some efficiency to the U.S. government. Make [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  no mistake, there'll be concerns on the part of CIA officers. They're never shy about raising [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  them. Of course, it's not subjected to public scrutiny, but they'll be asking, I'm sure, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=66.24s)]
*  about reductions in our foreign service and civil service and the impact that might have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=70.88s)]
*  operations. I mean, is there a lot of wasted money in the CIA? A lot of it's clandestine money [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=78.28s)]
*  that you guys need at your ready to pay bad guys to give up bad guys. Look, the budget's incredibly [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=84.2s)]
*  small. Human intelligence is really cheap, especially when you compare that to the cost of like one [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=92.84s)]
*  missile that we might use to strike some Houthis, as we did recently. Also, there's very extensive [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=97.88s)]
*  oversight from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and so there really isn't an issue, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=104.0s)]
*  at least from my experience of waste, fraud, and abuse at the CIA. But that said, it's a good thing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=110.24s)]
*  to have this discussion, and the CIA is always looking to ensure that we use the government's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=117.16s)]
*  money, the people's money, as efficiently as possible. All right, let's use our rest of our [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=121.88s)]
*  time to talk about the stunning revelations over the weekend. Vladimir Putin went out of his way [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=125.36s)]
*  to question Vladimir Zelensky's credibility as president, as if he's not a legitimate president [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=129.32s)]
*  who doesn't win legitimate elections. And this really ticked off Trump. He spoke about it this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=135.88s)]
*  weekend because now he's really mad at Russia. Watch. So I wasn't happy with that, but I think [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=141.32s)]
*  he's going to be good. And I certainly wouldn't want to put secondary tariffs on Russia, but if [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=148.72s)]
*  they were put on, it would not be very good for them. Zelensky, by the way, I see he's trying to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=155.76s)]
*  back out of the rare earth deal. And if he does that, he's got some problems, big, big problems. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=161.32s)]
*  And now he's saying, well, you know, I want to renegotiate the deal. He wants to be a member of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=168.32s)]
*  NATO. Well, he was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that. So first off, on the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=173.48s)]
*  Vladimir Putin thing, he's getting ticked off because he's trying to extract the most concessions [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=181.16s)]
*  possible just to have a ceasefire, an award that he started. And that's ticking off Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=185.12s)]
*  Yeah, and it should be. And look, there's a little bit of irony here that Vladimir Putin, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=190.44s)]
*  the KGB operative in the Kremlin, is criticizing Zelensky for not holding elections when Putin, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  in fact, hasn't held a real election in Russia in over a quarter century. And look, I think what [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=203.12s)]
*  Putin wants to do is make it appear as if Zelensky's government isn't legitimate so that when down the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=207.88s)]
*  road in the future, Russia breaks the next agreement, they can claim they did it because [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=213.32s)]
*  the government of Ukraine that signed the deal wasn't legitimate in the first place. And it's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=217.04s)]
*  just a way for Russia to put more pressure on Ukraine. Look, for the, for President Trump, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=221.76s)]
*  it's extremely hard to bring an end to a conflict where neither side is one and neither side is too [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  fatigued to carry on fighting. And that's, I think, what we're seeing right now. Putin's pressing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=231.56s)]
*  maximalist demands and we need to push back. Real quick, are these secondary sanctions, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  for example, on India and China for buying Russia discounted oil? Is that going to be effective? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=242.48s)]
*  Will that, will he feel that? I never felt like when President Biden made those sorts of threats [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=248.48s)]
*  before the war that they would have deterred Putin and they didn't. And in this case, look, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  Russia swiveled their economy to India and China. I just don't know that economic pressure at this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=259.4s)]
*  point is going to do it. Russia is experiencing an unbalanced wartime economy, but I don't think [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=263.88s)]
*  that's going to stop Putin from carrying on with this brutal invasion of Ukraine and raining down [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=269.12s)]
*  hell on Ukrainian civilians. What might stop him is to continue to arm Ukraine and give them the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=274.08s)]
*  munitions they need to carry on the fight. That might be the only answer, unfortunately. We'll [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=281.04s)]
*  see if we get there. And if they want to keep fighting, they got to draft 18 year olds. They [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=285.86s)]
*  just know they start at 27. They need fighters. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=289.8s)]
*  So President Trump is set to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin again this week after [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=294.52s)]
*  accusing Russia of stalling on potential peace agreement. Yes. Ukraine. Yeah. He says he wants [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  to a regime change first in Ukraine. That's not going to happen. Maddie Rivera is live from the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=307.88s)]
*  White House with the latest Maddie. Hi guys. Good morning. President Trump used perhaps some of his [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  strongest language yet against Russian President Vladimir Putin. This comes after Putin called for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  a transitional government to replace Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. The president then [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=322.8s)]
*  said he would consider imposing secondary tariffs on Russia if he believes it were at fault for not [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=327.76s)]
*  reaching a ceasefire in Ukraine. Disappointed in a certain way. Some of the things that were said [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  over the last day or two having to do with Salitsky because with he considers Salitsky not credible, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=340.2s)]
*  he's supposed to be making a deal with him whether you like it or you don't like it. So I wasn't happy [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=346.64s)]
*  with that. But I think he's going to be good and I certainly wouldn't want to put secondary tariffs [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=352.28s)]
*  on Russia. But if they were put on, it would not be very good for that. But the president is also [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=359.55999999999995s)]
*  criticizing Zelensky who he says is now trying to reverse course on a rare minerals deal. This was [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=366.4s)]
*  that agreement that the president and Zelensky were supposed to sign last month before a blowout [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=372.32s)]
*  in the Oval Office. After that spats, Zelensky said he was ready to move ahead with the deal. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=376.55999999999995s)]
*  Now the president is suggesting there may be more snags. I think Zelensky, by the way, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=381.36s)]
*  I see he's trying to back out of the rare earth deal. We made a deal on rare earth and now he's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=387.24s)]
*  saying, well, you know, I want to renegotiate the deal. He wants to be a member of NATO. Well, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=393.84s)]
*  he was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that. So if he's looking to renegotiate [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=400.0s)]
*  the deal, he's got big problems. The president also threatened consequences for Iran if a new [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=405.6s)]
*  nuclear deal is not reached. He tells NBC News it will be bombing the likes of which they have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=411.8s)]
*  never seen before. There's a chance that if they don't make a deal that I will do secondary tariffs [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=417.48s)]
*  on them like I did four years ago. Iran's president though is ruling out direct negotiations with the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=422.68s)]
*  U.S. but indirect negotiations are still on the table. Lawrence Ainsley and Brian. All right. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  He says if Russia is to blame, if you buy oil from Russia, if your country does, you can't do [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=434.48s)]
*  business in the United States and there will be a 25 to 50 percent tariff on all oil and says he's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=441.24s)]
*  angry with Putin. He was pissed off. Well, yeah, this was the moment that was going to be bound to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=447.56s)]
*  happen and I encourage people to have patience with the president as he set up the deal because [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=452.48s)]
*  at one point Putin was going to overplay his hand and what he did and the moment after the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  president got Zelensky to the table, crafted this deal, it was a little give and take. Now Putin [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=462.72s)]
*  asked for something ridiculous and of course the president's hammers comes right down. Yeah, so [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=469.24s)]
*  he says what he'll do is anybody who buys oil, they're sustaining themselves by selling oil at a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  discount rate to India and China predominantly, not that they need to sell it to Iran, but to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=480.88000000000005s)]
*  their allies and a lot of people just taking it. South Africa for example. So now he says if you [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=486.24s)]
*  do business with them, just like he's going to do with Iran, now we're going to sanction you. That's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=491.72s)]
*  going to get complicated because we're friendly with India and they're friendly with Russia, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=495.44000000000005s)]
*  but that's something that might be able to get their attention. Also, we got to arm up Ukraine, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=499.44000000000005s)]
*  maybe give them additional arms and lengthen this process a little. Dan Hoffman weighed in. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=504.8s)]
*  There's a little bit of irony here that Vladimir Putin, the KGB operative in the Kremlin, is [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=509.56s)]
*  criticizing Zelensky for not holding elections when Putin in fact hasn't held a real election [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=516.16s)]
*  in Russia in over a quarter century. And look, I think what Putin wants to do is make it appear [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=522.64s)]
*  as if Zelensky's government isn't legitimate so that when down the road in the future Russia [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  breaks the next agreement, they can claim they did it because the government of Ukraine that signed [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=532.0s)]
*  the deal wasn't legitimate in the first place. And it's just a way for Russia to put more pressure [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=536.56s)]
*  on Ukraine. Russia is experiencing an unbalanced wartime economy, but I don't think that's going [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  to stop Putin from carrying on with this brutal invasion of Ukraine and raining down hell on [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=546.16s)]
*  Ukrainian civilians. What might stop him is to continue to arm Ukraine and give them the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=551.28s)]
*  munitions they need to carry on the fight. That might be the only answer, unfortunately. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=557.8s)]
*  And also, Zelensky agreed to this minerals deal with the United States, and Donald Trump says now [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  he wants to renegotiate. And he says if that happens, there's going to be a big problem, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=568.32s)]
*  because they've already worked that out. It's two prongs. How you attack Putin is two ways. If he's [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=572.88s)]
*  not going to agree to peace, then you attack him two ways. You go after his economy, you got the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qnlNChTqU&t=580.24s)]
