# Ukraine has 'no choice' but to show good will to the US, says KT McFarland
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY)
*  All right, happening right now, top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mark [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=0.0s)]
*  Rubio and Mike Walsh, National Security Advisor, are meeting with Ukraine officials in Saudi [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=3.68s)]
*  Arabia, obviously pushing for peace with Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=9.28s)]
*  Special Envoy Steve Woodcock says Ukrainian President Zelensky apologized for his tense [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=12.48s)]
*  exchange with President Trump and Vice President Vance. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=16.96s)]
*  Zelensky sent a letter to the president. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=21.12s)]
*  He apologized for that whole incident that happened in the office. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=23.7s)]
*  I think that was an important step, and I would like to describe it as progress. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=28.8s)]
*  Joining us now is former Deputy National Security Advisor KT McFarland. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  KT, what are the stakes today for Ukraine? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh, it's complete, everything. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=43.6s)]
*  Ukraine has to figure out a way to get this back on track. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Now, why? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Because of that disastrous White House meeting. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=51.2s)]
*  And so the Secretary of State, National Security Advisor are meeting with the Ukrainians, and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=53.72s)]
*  first of all, it's not just the apology letter that Zelensky sent, but what does that mean? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=58.64s)]
*  What are they likely to give up? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=64.4s)]
*  What does the deal look like? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=65.58s)]
*  Rubio is now really engaging in what I would call a good old-fashioned shuttle diplomacy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=67.12s)]
*  When my boss Henry Kissinger did it in the 1970s when I worked for him, it was going [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=72.08s)]
*  to one side and saying, what are your bottom lines here? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=77.16s)]
*  What can you give up? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=80.28s)]
*  What do you have to have? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=81.28s)]
*  And then go to the other side separately. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=83.48s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  What can you give up? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  So they start going back and forth in a very rapid fashion to try to craft a deal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=87.24s)]
*  The difference with this one is that everybody knows the guy making the decisions for the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  United States is sitting in the White House. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is taking an active role in these negotiations. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=98.32s)]
*  So it's not like the good old-fashioned State Department negotiations where they come up [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=101.66s)]
*  with a position and then they bring it forward and then they debate it and then they go back [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=105.56s)]
*  and forth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=109.24s)]
*  This is happening in rapid time and in real time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=110.24s)]
*  So we understand Zelensky's not there, but everybody else is, and they're going to talk [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=112.69999999999999s)]
*  about what, you know, maybe confidence building on both sides. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=116.8s)]
*  First off, stop the flights, stop the drones, or you could you stop hitting energy sectors. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=119.6s)]
*  That's what the Russians are good at. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=125.72s)]
*  But yesterday or a couple of days ago, we took down intelligence sharing and we took [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=126.72s)]
*  down the satellites that allowed them to see incoming rockets. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=131.04s)]
*  The Russians took advantage of that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=134.32s)]
*  There's a sense, some reports say, that they'll reinstall that if they say sincerity on the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=136.04s)]
*  Ukrainian side. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=140.72s)]
*  Do you hear the same thing? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=141.72s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=143.92s)]
*  Everyone knows that Ukraine doesn't survive without American intelligence sharing and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=146.84s)]
*  American military equipment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=151.44s)]
*  I mean, they don't survive for long. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=152.44s)]
*  So Ukraine is really no choice. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=154.36s)]
*  They've got to show some goodwill here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  They've got to come up with something to say, look, we understand the situation you're in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  and here's our gesture, here's our goodwill gesture. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Please turn the security sharing and the weapon system back on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  The key, though, is going to be two words, security guarantees. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=170.24s)]
*  Ukraine keeps insisting they want American security guarantees, which sounds like a military [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=175.2s)]
*  security guarantee, which sounds like boots on the ground, which sounds like basically [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=178.88s)]
*  the equivalent of NATO membership. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  And President Trump has said, that's no way. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=184.72s)]
*  Americans are not sending military forces into this engagement. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=187.28s)]
*  But you know who is? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=189.72s)]
*  Russia and France. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=190.72s)]
*  And if Russia doesn't, excuse me, France and England. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=191.72s)]
*  And if they don't like that, the Russians say that that's a non-starter, but I can't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  see anything moving forward. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  We'll find out because it looks like Witkoff could be going to Russia afterwards. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=199.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, Witkoff has also got another job, a Middle East envoy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And the word is he's participating in the Doha talks in an effort to broker a hostage [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=208.08s)]
*  deal and get the rest out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  We made it clear to Hamas that nothing happens unless you guys get out of Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=214.6s)]
*  What kind of impasse is that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  What kind of hurdle is that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=221.88s)]
*  Well, again, President Trump said it really well. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=223.44s)]
*  He said, you know, Hamas has no choice. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=226.88s)]
*  He's already told Israel, go finish the job, if that's what it takes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=229.72s)]
*  President Trump's also signed on to Israel stopping the aid and the electricity to Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=233.12s)]
*  Hamas is finished one way or the other. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=239.52s)]
*  And it's now a matter of how do you get American citizens back and how do you get the hostages [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=242.96s)]
*  back? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=246.96s)]
*  I think President Trump was very moved when he met the hostages in the Oval Office last [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=247.96s)]
*  week. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=251.76s)]
*  I've met them as well. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=252.76s)]
*  And you can't look into the eyes of those people who've been through hell and back being [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=254.28s)]
*  held hostage. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=258.48s)]
*  I mean, their eyes are empty. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=259.48s)]
*  They're just really tough and wonderful people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=261.28s)]
*  But man, did they go through a lot. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=264.23999999999995s)]
*  It's hard to see that and then somehow have a lot of sympathy for Hamas. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=265.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  And there's all types of proposals how to go forward. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  And some people are ticked off at Adam Boller for going into Gaza to try to get those hostages [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=272.2s)]
*  out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  We'll also find out more and more reports. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  The hostages say there's a link between Hamas and the financing and support of the campus [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=281.32s)]
*  unrest we're seeing in places like Columbia, Yale and Harvard across the country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=287.54s)]
*  That's something we're going to talk about a little bit later. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=291.86s)]
*  KT McFarland, thanks so much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJm--d9QcY&t=293.66s)]
