# Israeli forces recover 36-foot Iranian missile
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA)
*  Fox News, we are now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=0.0s)]
*  Action could be imminent as Israel weighs a response to Iran's missile attack on Saturday. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=1.56s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live next to one of those Iranian missiles in southern Israel that hit ground. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=6.24s)]
*  Trey, was that knocked out of the sky or did that land? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=11.4s)]
*  Yeah, hey Brian, good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=14.68s)]
*  Behind me is the fuel cell of an Iranian ballistic missile that was recovered by the Israelis [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=17.52s)]
*  following that attack by Iran this weekend. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=23.6s)]
*  You can see the sheer size of this missile, 36 feet long, and this is about 70% of the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=25.96s)]
*  entire missile that was launched from Iranian territory. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=33.4s)]
*  The Israelis don't know what the exact target was, but they do know it was either shot down [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=36.84s)]
*  or it separated as it entered Israeli territory. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=42.2s)]
*  We also know that there was a 500 kilogram warhead on top of this missile. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=46.56s)]
*  It's about half a ton of explosives and it was one of more than 110 ballistic missiles [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=51.08s)]
*  launched toward Israel over the weekend. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=57.16s)]
*  I do want you to listen to Israel's chief of staff, Herze Helevi, who released a new [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  statement in English overnight discussing what the Israeli response to this attack might [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=64.08s)]
*  be. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=69.4s)]
*  The region is waiting to see how Israel will respond to this ballistic missile, cruise [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=81.08s)]
*  missile and drone attack launched by Iran over the weekend. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=90.88s)]
*  They do have a variety of options and Israel's war cabinet is set to meet for a third day [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=94.48s)]
*  in a row. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=99.64s)]
*  Later tonight, they will be discussing how Israel plans to strike back against the Islamic [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=100.64s)]
*  Republic. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=105.16s)]
*  Brian? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=106.16s)]
*  Alright, Trey, thanks so much. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=107.16s)]
*  Everyone's on pins and needles in the entire area. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=108.16s)]
*  Nobody knows exactly what's next. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=110.6s)]
*  Thanks Trey. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9pEq9N5YFA&t=113.67999999999999s)]
