# Top Trump officials' personal data reportedly leaked online
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA)
*  All right, here we go several top Trump officials have reportedly had some of their personal data leaking online [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=0.0s)]
*  Adding to the fallout of the administration's signal chat leak Peter do see joins us from the White House with more [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=6.46s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. Good morning [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  and among the top national security officials here who need to change their passwords this morning because theirs have now leaked online are [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=15.22s)]
*  the National Security Advisor Mike waltz the director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and the Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=23.1s)]
*  Hegseth, but those officials continue enjoying the backing of their boss [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=30.08s)]
*  It's all a witch hunt [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=35.88s)]
*  Here we are talking about some of the greatest business deals ever made the greatest companies in the world are moving into the United States [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=37.8s)]
*  And you want to ask about whether or not signal works. I don't know that signal works [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=44.16s)]
*  I think signal could be defective to be honest with you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=48.14s)]
*  And you heard it there the president is trying to move on to talk about other stuff like auto tariffs [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=51.08s)]
*  The mainstream media continues to be focused on a sensationalized story from the failing Atlantic magazine if this story proves anything [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=57.16s)]
*  It proves that Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media know how to fabricate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=65.66s)]
*  orchestrate and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=72.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and the doge guys are looking at tech flaws that could have allowed this to happen [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=76.12s)]
*  But the Secretary of State doesn't think any damage was done sharing attack plans with a reporter [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=80.32s)]
*  The Pentagon says it was not and not only did they say it was not they make very clear that it didn't put in danger [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=85.48s)]
*  Anyone's life or the mission at the intelligence there was no intelligence information [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  And that's coming from the highest ranking officials at the agency that was in charge of the of the actual operation [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=94.04s)]
*  That's their story and they're sticking to it because the most classified stuff that exists like the location of unit [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=101.2s)]
*  The type of unit the flight paths to target was not ever shared [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=108.48s)]
*  On the signal group chat and because no US service members were directly harmed because of it back to you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=113.12s)]
*  So Peter you started your report talking about how some of these top national security people they've got [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=120.12s)]
*  Stuff they've got their data leaked online where it's it's their names and it's their passwords and stuff like that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=126.12s)]
*  Most damaging of course is the one just the fact that it's Mike Waltz [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=133.12s)]
*  Normally somebody would take that kind of stuff down before a confirmation hearing but he didn't go through that process [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=140.12s)]
*  So maybe that's why it's still out there and kind of surprising because I remember during the first White House [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=147.12s)]
*  The first Trump White House at one point the press secretary Sean Spicer had his Venmo leak and people were sending him [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=154.12s)]
*  Money with a nasty message or requesting money and stuff like that so it's not the first time that this has happened [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=159.12s)]
*  But it definitely is another headache I think Mike Waltz has woken up with a headache every day this week [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=164.12s)]
*  Well you can send me money with a nasty message anytime you want any leads on who could have leaked this information [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=171.12s)]
*  No and it seems like they were using commercial apps like WhatsApp and Venmo and it's easy to it's easier to locate somebody [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=178.12s)]
*  Kind of backwards if you have their phone number then you can go and try to find them on these apps and it seems like that's what happened here [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=187.12s)]
*  But it doesn't appear that anything sensitive has leaked just more more of somebody's going to have to go through and change all their passwords on their personal phone today [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=194.12s)]
*  Thanks Peter so the thing is they're moving to the good news for this story is that the good news for this story is that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=201.12s)]
*  They're moving at the so-called Trump speed there is so much more going on number one the attacks on the Houthis is continuing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=208.12s)]
*  The talks are rushing Ukraine are continuing that's going to be newsworthy the president's tariffs are really newsworthy [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=215.12s)]
*  But for the Democrats they want to talk about this Chuck Schumer wants to talk about anything but him and they want to talk about this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=221.12s)]
*  The timing was fortuitous for Democrats because they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=227.12s)]
*  And they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration and they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=234.12s)]
*  And they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration and they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=241.12s)]
*  And they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration and they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=248.12s)]
*  And they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration and they were trying to get the president to talk about the Trump administration [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=255.12s)]
*  I think you should wake up embarrassed this morning because he took his time to tar and attack Pete Hegseth on something totally unsubstantiated [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=262.12s)]
*  I think you should wake up embarrassed this morning because he took his time to tar and attack Pete Hegseth on something totally unsubstantiated [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=269.12s)]
*  Listen [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=272.12s)]
*  Do you know whether Pete Hegseth had been drinking before he leaked classified information? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=273.12s)]
*  I don't have any knowledge of Secretary Hegseth's personal habits [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=279.12s)]
*  Director Radcliffe, same question [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=284.12s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=290.12s)]
*  You know, no, I'm going to answer that. I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=291.12s)]
*  I find it interesting that you want to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=296.12s)]
*  Hey, I yield back. This is my time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=298.12s)]
*  Director [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=300.12s)]
*  You asked me a question. Do you want to answer? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=301.12s)]
*  No, listen, it's a yes or no [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=302.12s)]
*  You don't want to focus on the good work that the CIA is doing. Was his performance compromised because of a successful strike? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=303.12s)]
*  I yield back. Mr. I bring my [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=310.12s)]
*  You want to know? You want to talk about accepting responsibility? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=312.12s)]
*  I reclaim my time [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=315.12s)]
*  I tie responsibility for a successful strike to make Americans safer? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=316.12s)]
*  These people are crazy. I mean, Crayton, trying to create a moment, he looks terrible right there. There's no evidence to suggest that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=320.12s)]
*  By the way, the Secretary has been open and transparent about him turning his life around and he doesn't drink anymore. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=329.12s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I was down there reporting in Texas he was there and I forgot all about him and said we got to catch up over beers [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=336.12s)]
*  I seriously don't drink anymore. So I just think it's terrible. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=342.12s)]
*  Also, this is the party that has defended Hunter Biden, a drug addict and defended him and said don't attack people during their recovery. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=346.12s)]
*  But now you want to go up to the secretary where there's no evidence. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=356.12s)]
*  Well, you know, what's interesting about the line of questioning from that particular Democrat member of Congress is it seems like they have based their questioning of a high ranking government official on something that they've spotted online. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=359.12s)]
*  On social media. Because there was an image of Pete Hexett drinking out of a glass and it appeared to be like a dark liquid. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=371.12s)]
*  It was a glass of water. It was an optical illusion. But instead of asking, what was he drinking? They did it that way. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=378.12s)]
*  And also, how about the congressman saying, I'm reclaiming my time, the second the CIA director starts to answer. That's not how it works. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=385.12s)]
*  He needs to respond to the question. And then John Radcliffe just absolutely took the congressman down. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=392.12s)]
*  Destroyed them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=397.12s)]
*  And you almost hate to defend the defense secretary from this line of questioning because you don't even want to add legitimacy to this because it's so ridiculous. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=398.12s)]
*  But this was an authorized use platform, a platform that the Biden administration used as well. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=407.12s)]
*  And when the CIA director testified on Tuesday, he said the first thing that happened when I was sworn in as CIA director is that signal was uploaded to my computer. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=413.12s)]
*  So the use of the platform has been something that has happened for years. And now there will be a relook at maybe it shouldn't happen again. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=424.12s)]
*  But it's not like they did anything wrong. And a lot is being focused now on what could have happened. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=433.12s)]
*  Then what did happen when what was shown in those messages is that the defense secretary, Pete Hexett, organized a successful strike that took down terrorists. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=437.12s)]
*  I would just do the Brigham axiom. Move on. You know, if something evolves, you do it. You move on. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=445.12s)]
*  But there's so many other people in that press room. And I would say this, Lawrence, I think you know this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=451.12s)]
*  You never had a drinking problem. They would tell you I know. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=455.12s)]
*  I was they drank too much. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=457.12s)]
*  But he just gave it up. Right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=459.12s)]
*  Completely. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=460.12s)]
*  Totally. So there were no misspellings in that exchange. There was nothing that was bizarre. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=461.12s)]
*  It was extremely official. I found it interesting. Normally you have to wait for the administration to end to find out about this type of insider give and take. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=465.12s)]
*  So there was no reason to do that except for that smug attitude. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=473.12s)]
*  You think you could take your shot and get your moments because no one's ever heard of you. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=477.12s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igM-Aym7dqA&t=481.12s)]
