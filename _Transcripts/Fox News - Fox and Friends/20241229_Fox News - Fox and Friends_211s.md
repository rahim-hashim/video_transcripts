# 'DELUSIONAL': Biden reportedly regrets dropping out of 2024 race
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg)
*  Believe it or not, did you know Joe Biden is still president? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=0.0s)]
*  I still can't sort of believe it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=2.6s)]
*  Washington Post had a story out yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=5.0s)]
*  I think it may possibly be the most delusional story [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=8.28s)]
*  coming from like five different angles [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=12.32s)]
*  about how he regrets dropping out of the race. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=15.64s)]
*  The headline, Joe Biden's lonely battle [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=19.2s)]
*  to sell his vision of American democracy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=21.12s)]
*  In his presidency's final chapter, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=25.44s)]
*  Biden has mused about whether he should have handled [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=27.52s)]
*  some decisions differently. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=31.0s)]
*  One of those being that his decision to drop out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=37.08s)]
*  He's saying he thought he could have beat Donald Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=37.92s)]
*  It's always, it's an easy thing to say. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=39.96s)]
*  I wasn't in the championship game. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=42.0s)]
*  I lost in the semis, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=43.56s)]
*  but I would have won the championship game [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=44.86s)]
*  if I'd made the, I'm using it now in fantasy football. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=46.44s)]
*  Joe Biden, I'm using that exact same excuse. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=49.36s)]
*  Maybe he's just saying he was better than, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=51.2s)]
*  maybe what he's saying is I was better than Kamala. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=53.34s)]
*  I had a better chance than Kamala. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=55.6s)]
*  And who knows? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=57.6s)]
*  But he did say in the Washington Post, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=58.44s)]
*  they're saying he said, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=59.92s)]
*  Biden and some of his aides still believe [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=60.96s)]
*  he should have stayed in the race. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=62.24s)]
*  Despite the rocky debate performance and low poll numbers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  that prompted Democrats to pressure him to drop out, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=66.08s)]
*  Biden and his aides have told people in recent days [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=68.56s)]
*  that he could have defeated Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=70.48s)]
*  Aides say the president has been careful [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=72.04s)]
*  not to place blame on Harris or her campaign. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  What's so interesting about that though, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=77.04s)]
*  is that this whole thing was an off the record, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=78.64s)]
*  anonymous quotes back and forth. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=83.88s)]
*  And both sides are treating, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=86.16s)]
*  the Harris supporters and the Biden supporters [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=87.88s)]
*  are treating one another with such kid gloves, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=90.36s)]
*  being so careful. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=92.44s)]
*  Why do you think? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=93.28s)]
*  I think because they both know so much about the others [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=94.12s)]
*  that they don't want, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=97.34s)]
*  that the Biden people in the White House [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=98.48s)]
*  don't want the Harris people really commenting out [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=101.16s)]
*  and talking about how bad things were and vice versa. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=104.62s)]
*  Right, because the covering up of Joe Biden's mental decline [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=107.56s)]
*  is one of the biggest scandals of our time actually. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=114.12s)]
*  And both sides were implicated. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=116.64s)]
*  Both sides participated in that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=118.72s)]
*  I wanna show this clip of Joe Biden at the debate. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=121.0s)]
*  I think we have a montage, do we not? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=123.92s)]
*  All right, let's watch that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=126.52s)]
*  That $2 trillion tax code benefited the very wealthy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=127.36s)]
*  What I'm gonna do is fix the tax system. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=131.72s)]
*  For example, we have a thousand billionaires in America. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=133.24s)]
*  If they just paid 24%, 25%, either one of those numbers, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=138.68s)]
*  they'd raise $500 million, billion dollars, I should say, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=143.08s)]
*  making sure that we're able to make [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=147.08s)]
*  every single solitary person eligible [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  for what I've been able to do with the COVID, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Look, if we finally beat Medicare. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=162.44s)]
*  Thank you, President Biden. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=167.96s)]
*  And I'm gonna continue to move until we get the total ban. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=169.56s)]
*  The total initiative relative to what we're gonna do [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  with more border patrol and more asylum officers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=177.28s)]
*  President Trump? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't think he knows what he said either. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=185.0s)]
*  Look. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=186.4s)]
*  Donald Trump won the debate right there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=187.24s)]
*  That was the end of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  He liked old movies. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=192.36s)]
*  Is it On the Waterfront with Marlon Brando? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=193.36s)]
*  It could have been a contender. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=197.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=197.84s)]
*  It could have won, but for that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=198.68s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1ERo-HPyg&t=201.04000000000002s)]
