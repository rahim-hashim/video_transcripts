# 'ABSOLUTELY TRASH': Noem blasts 'fake news' report from CNN #shorts #foxnews #news #us #fox #noem
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8)
*  On that point, CNN is basically, you've got a report accusing you of slowing the process. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=0.0s)]
*  Would you like to respond to that? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=5.28s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=6.88s)]
*  Fake news. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=7.88s)]
*  CNN again, is absolutely trash what they are doing by saying that because our Coast Guard, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=8.88s)]
*  our Border Patrol, BORTC teams were there immediately. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=13.56s)]
*  Every single thing I was on, they asked for, we were there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=17.2s)]
*  The governor and the emergency management director, Nim Kidd, are fantastic. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=20.92s)]
*  And nobody there has said anything about that they didn't get everything that they wanted [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=26.04s)]
*  immediately or that they needed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=31.28s)]
*  And I'm proud of the work that we've done to support that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  But you know, we've got flooding going on in New Mexico as well. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=35.8s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=38.44s)]
*  So I've been visiting with their leadership team and spent quite a bit of time on the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=39.44s)]
*  phone yesterday with the New Mexico governor, getting them resources as well. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=43.2s)]
*  And that's what we do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=48.2s)]
*  The fact that CNN is continuing to be political and push out fake information and false information [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  and lies is not shocking, but it's a disservice to the country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFSFND2d3F8&t=57.879999999999995s)]
