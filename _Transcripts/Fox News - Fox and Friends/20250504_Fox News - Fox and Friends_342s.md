# EPA axes billions in federal grants and contracts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4)
*  This is the former Biden EPA Museum. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=0.0s)]
*  There was $4 million to build. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=3.84s)]
*  We are standing in the middle of one, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  basically a one bedroom apartment [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=8.48s)]
*  and $600,000 a year to operate. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=11.48s)]
*  Money can be better spent elsewhere. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=14.68s)]
*  Last month, we told you about EPA Chief Lee Zeldin [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  shutting the Biden era EPA Museum [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=20.8s)]
*  for wasting millions of your taxpayer dollars. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=23.72s)]
*  That was an outrageous story. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=25.64s)]
*  And it only had just a few visitors. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=27.4s)]
*  Yeah, and that's just the beginning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  Zeldin's office says it's already cut [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=31.64s)]
*  $22 billion in wasteful grants and contracts. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=34.44s)]
*  In case you didn't know this, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=39.6s)]
*  that's actually double the agency's operating budget. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=40.6s)]
*  We have EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=44.2s)]
*  to join us now and talk about this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for joining us [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=49.84s)]
*  and tell us about these cuts you found. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=50.86s)]
*  It's important for EPA to be operating [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=54.96s)]
*  as efficiently as possible. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=57.54s)]
*  And we're not going to operate under this mentality [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=58.78s)]
*  that challenging the status quo is unacceptable. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=62.94s)]
*  It's some sacred cow. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=66.06s)]
*  We inherited all of these Biden era regulations. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=67.46s)]
*  We aren't going to treat those [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=70.18s)]
*  as if they're etched in stone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=72.02s)]
*  And as we see tens of billions of dollars [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=73.74s)]
*  going out through self-dealing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=76.42s)]
*  and conflicts of interest, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=77.82s)]
*  unqualified recipients and reduced agency oversight, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=78.94s)]
*  we're going to take action. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=82.7s)]
*  We will have a zero tolerance policy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=83.86s)]
*  for any waste and abuse. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=86.08s)]
*  So these are the principles that we bring in. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=87.96s)]
*  And the Trump mandate at the Trump EPA [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=89.96s)]
*  is making sure that we're operating [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  as efficiently as possible [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=94.48s)]
*  and we're powering the great American comeback. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=95.92s)]
*  That means clean air, land and water for all Americans [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=97.64s)]
*  that gets to our core mission, unleashing energy dominance, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  pursuing, advancing cooperative federalism, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=104.68s)]
*  pursuing permitting reform, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=108.0s)]
*  making America the AI capital of the world, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=109.64s)]
*  bringing back American auto jobs. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=111.68s)]
*  We choose both protecting the environment [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=113.8s)]
*  and growing the economy at the Trump EPA. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=116.2s)]
*  You know what, two parts of this comment, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=118.88s)]
*  Kevin Cork here with you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=121.8s)]
*  Administrator, first of all, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=123.32s)]
*  I know you're a cabinet member now, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=124.72s)]
*  but I still miss seeing you on Gutfeld. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=126.06s)]
*  Just gonna throw that out there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=128.16s)]
*  We think you should get back on the show. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=129.28s)]
*  Always very entertaining. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=131.24s)]
*  I want to ask you about returning [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=132.72s)]
*  to Reagan era staffing levels. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=134.04s)]
*  I live in Washington. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=136.32s)]
*  A lot of people there, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=137.64s)]
*  a lot of consternation about staffing cuts, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=138.6s)]
*  but you feel like you can efficiently do the job with less. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=141.64s)]
*  Yeah, so we come in and we inherit these massive backlogs, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  hundreds of state implementation plans [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  that have to be reviewed, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=153.16s)]
*  hundreds of new chemicals, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=154.32s)]
*  over 12,000 pesticides that are under review. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=156.2s)]
*  And when I sit down with these offices [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  and I ask them, what do you need [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  in order to be able to get rid of these backlogs, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  they have ideas for other employees in the agencies [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=167.64s)]
*  that are working on other things [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=171.36s)]
*  that if they were helping them, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=173.36s)]
*  we can reduce all these backlogs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  So what was so important to us is making sure [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=177.08s)]
*  that we are fulfilling all of our statutory obligations [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  and that we were getting rid of these backlogs [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  that we inherited. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=185.88000000000002s)]
*  So we believe that we should have not one more [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=187.72000000000003s)]
*  or one less employee than what is necessary [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  to fulfill these statutory obligations [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=193.28000000000003s)]
*  and power the great American comeback. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  Every employee costs on average about $200,000 [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=197.44s)]
*  to the American taxpayer. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=202.04s)]
*  We owe it to the American taxpayer [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=203.56s)]
*  to operate as efficiently as possible. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=205.32s)]
*  And reducing the size of government [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=207.4s)]
*  isn't about going backwards. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=209.76s)]
*  It's about making sure that we're modernizing the workforce [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=211.56s)]
*  and operating as efficiently as possible for the taxpayer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=215.12s)]
*  You know, one of the things that's been really interesting [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=218.72s)]
*  about this administration is the way secretaries [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=221.48s)]
*  or departments have been overlapping [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=225.6s)]
*  with other departments, working together. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  Talk to me about how the EPA is working with Maha and HHS. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=231.04s)]
*  So chaired by Secretary Kennedy, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  the Make America Healthy Again commission [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  brings together different agencies [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=242.92s)]
*  with overlapping jurisdiction, as you point out, Rachel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=245.56s)]
*  And I just did an event with Secretary Kennedy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  in Salt Lake City, Utah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=251.68s)]
*  Secretary Kennedy was advocating passionately for EPA [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=253.44s)]
*  to be considering new science [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=258.36s)]
*  as it relates to fluoride and drinking water. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=260.36s)]
*  I sat and met with him. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  I heard his argument. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=264.08s)]
*  It was very compelling. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=266.04s)]
*  So that's what we're gonna do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=267.2s)]
*  The last time the EPA looked at the science [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=268.2s)]
*  was July of 2024, but after that, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=271.4s)]
*  the National Toxicology Program released a report in August. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  And there's other studies to look at too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=277.76s)]
*  This is Secretary Kennedy fulfilling [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=279.92s)]
*  what in many respects was President Trump's campaign promise [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=283.48s)]
*  to bring these agencies together. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  We also see with the National Energy Dominance Council. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=288.04s)]
*  I'm often sitting down at meetings inside the Oval Office [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  and it's not just me. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll be there with Secretary Duffy and Lutnick [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=295.16s)]
*  and Burgum and Wright and others talking to the president [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=298.88s)]
*  about where we all are working together [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=303.32s)]
*  to make sure that we're not siloed off. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=305.92s)]
*  We are getting his agenda over the finish line fast. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=308.8s)]
*  I love it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=312.44s)]
*  I love it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=313.28s)]
*  Mr. President Zeldin, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=314.12s)]
*  As a conservationist, I appreciate this point of view. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=314.96s)]
*  I hope that you're working [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=317.96s)]
*  with some of those organizations. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  We do wanna protect the world God created for us. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqokqccVlP4&t=320.2s)]
