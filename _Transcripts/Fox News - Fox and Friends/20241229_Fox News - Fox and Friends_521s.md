# Shannon Bream warns Mike Johnson is in 'real' trouble: He can 'only lose' this vote
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA)
*  But let's begin this hour on Capitol Hill, as Democrats are reportedly united against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=0.0s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson ahead of new next month's speaker vote. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=4.72s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is in Washington with the details. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=9.28s)]
*  Madeline. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=11.4s)]
*  Hi, good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=12.4s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson survived an ouster bid in May. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=13.4s)]
*  He made it with the help of Democrats who voted to save him. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=15.92s)]
*  This time Democrats say they won't be doing that again. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=19.0s)]
*  I came and made that very clear. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=21.8s)]
*  And you saw that as we voted on the budget at the end of the year, we stayed united. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=25.6s)]
*  There were a lot of things in there that bothered us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=31.12s)]
*  We stayed together. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=34.0s)]
*  And trust me, we will do the same thing on the House floor when the vote for speaker [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=35.32s)]
*  comes up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Democrats are going to be united. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  We are not going to bail him out this time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  That puts Johnson in a tight spot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=45.08s)]
*  The next Congress will begin with 219 House Republicans and 215 House Democrats. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=46.92s)]
*  Johnson needs 218 votes to keep his job. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=52.919999999999995s)]
*  One Congressman, Republican Thomas Massey, has said he won't be supporting Johnson. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=55.8s)]
*  That means another defection could sink Johnson's prospects. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Other Congressmen Andy Harris, Scott Perry, Troy Nels, and Tim Burchett, for instance, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=63.28s)]
*  are also on the fence. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=67.24s)]
*  But Johnson's allies are warning against a fight over the gavel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=69.12s)]
*  They say a speaker's battle is a distraction and will delay them from enacting President-elect [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=72.4s)]
*  Trump's agenda. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=77.24s)]
*  I fully support Mike Johnson. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=78.24s)]
*  I think he's done as good a job as anyone could have done with the cars that he's been [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=80.48s)]
*  dealt. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  And then who else is going to do it? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  We have been given a mandate by the American people. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  President Trump has been given a mandate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=90.64s)]
*  The first 100 days are going to be extremely important. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=92.12s)]
*  We do not need a protracted speaker's race. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  We're still waiting for President-elect Trump to weigh in on the speaker's vote. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=99.48s)]
*  Republicans say he will have the ultimate word on Ruther Johnson's stays or goes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  Will Rachel and Charlie? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=108.16s)]
*  Well, thank you, Madeline, for that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=110.28s)]
*  Let's continue to analyze this with Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream, who joins us [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=112.08s)]
*  now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=115.96s)]
*  Hey, Shannon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=116.96s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=117.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=118.96s)]
*  You know, we were just sitting here during Madeline's report talking about this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=119.96s)]
*  I think it's no surprise that Democrats are united against Mike Johnson. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=122.36s)]
*  The question is about Republicans. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=126.64s)]
*  And is everything governing going forward? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=128.12s)]
*  It's going to be a question of Republicans and unity from Trump's nominees to his cabinet. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=129.72s)]
*  If he has enough Republican support, then they'll be his nominees. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=136.58s)]
*  And now with Mike Johnson, how much Republican support can he get? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=139.94000000000003s)]
*  And I turn that over to you, Shannon. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=143.78s)]
*  Well, so you guys know, as Madeline was reporting, that Thomas Massey is saying he is a no vote. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=145.5s)]
*  He's going to vote for someone other than Johnson. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  Unless he changes his mind, that's the deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=152.38000000000002s)]
*  And that's the only vote that Johnson can really lose based on the current numbers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=155.08s)]
*  Our Chad program, you know, who is the best of the best on Capitol Hill, he does the math [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=158.74s)]
*  for us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  And he says basically that's it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  Every other Republican has to stick together for Johnson or he is in real trouble. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=164.7s)]
*  But as you've also heard there, too, where do you go next? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=168.78s)]
*  Who is the other Republican that takes up this mantle and can get 218 votes? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  I do think it's going to be really important to hear from President Trump. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=177.1s)]
*  He's been supportive of the speaker. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  You heard Elon Musk also come out after that vote to get the continuing resolution done [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=181.16s)]
*  and saying he did the best with what he had to work with. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=185.33999999999997s)]
*  So absent that, it sounds like he's the guy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  But you can't lose anyone past Thomas Massey and hold on to the gavel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  And remember, they literally can't do anything in the House, including certify the election [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=194.42s)]
*  on January 6th if they don't have a speaker. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=198.66s)]
*  Well, we were just talking on the couch, I think I don't want to speak for everyone. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=200.89999999999998s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for Thomas Massey. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we all like Thomas Massey. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=206.38s)]
*  By the way, I like Speaker Johnson as well. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=208.26s)]
*  I do, too. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=210.66s)]
*  I think he's a very affable, great guy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=211.66s)]
*  But my question is, is Thomas Massey, has he put something on the table like I want [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=212.92s)]
*  you to do this and then you get my vote? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=217.5s)]
*  Or is he just a no, no matter what? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=219.82s)]
*  Well, what he said is that the legislative branch is behaving very weakly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=222.1s)]
*  He thinks that they need to stand up, be independent from the executive and judicial branches and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  do their job. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=229.74s)]
*  So based on that, I don't know what the speaker could tell him or give him that would assure [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=231.46s)]
*  him that is going to change enough to convince him by January 3rd. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=236.62s)]
*  But maybe they're having those backchannel conversations about what it will take to win [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  that vote back because it's so precarious. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=244.94s)]
*  But he hasn't publicly said something like a list of demands, you do these things, I [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  can't change my vote. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=251.06s)]
*  We haven't seen that publicly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=252.06s)]
*  Can I just say, Charlie, to you as much as Shannon, he also hasn't said what his alternative [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=253.06s)]
*  would be to Speaker Johnson. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=257.62s)]
*  Which is always the problem. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=259.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=260.5s)]
*  And the wonderful thing about Thomas Massey, but also the difficult thing about Thomas [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=261.5s)]
*  Massey, is that you're not going to buy him off by building a bridge in his district. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=264.82s)]
*  He really doesn't care about that kind of thing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=270.74s)]
*  He is a very highly principled guy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=273.02s)]
*  It does seem like the question that he's going to wind up getting stuck on is what is the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=276.42s)]
*  alternative and at a moment like this where you have, you know, Republicans have, you [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=281.18s)]
*  know, whatever it is, 70, 80 percent of what it is that they want, what they need to get [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  things done in Washington, do you want to derail that or get things on track with Trump [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=291.3s)]
*  in the White House and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=300.3s)]
*  It sounds like he's going to make his point when we're the other. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=304.9s)]
*  And again, if he's the only vote that Johnson loses, Johnson can still hold on to this thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=307.06s)]
*  The worst case scenario, way back in the 1860s I think it was, somebody went through 133 [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=312.82s)]
*  ballots to get to Speaker. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=319.26s)]
*  I do not think we're going to get anywhere near that this time, but there are real questions [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=321.14s)]
*  about how this thing gets done. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=324.98s)]
*  By the way, Congressman Massey is one of those who said, I don't buy the argument about pressuring [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=326.94s)]
*  me that we can't certify the election on January 6th. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  Like, that's not going to sway my vote. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=333.74s)]
*  I'm not worried about that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=335.74s)]
*  It's not an issue. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=336.74s)]
*  I have bigger concerns about how Congress is operating, but he hasn't given us an alternative [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=337.74s)]
*  name or somebody else he would vote for. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=342.14s)]
*  And that person, whoever it would be, is certainly not going to get to 218. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=344.5s)]
*  So how long he sticks with this and makes a point and whether other Republicans join him [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=347.86s)]
*  in some show of force or stick together and give Johnson the 218 he needs, we'll find out [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=353.22s)]
*  in a few days. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=358.1s)]
*  Well, Shannon, one of the things that is commendable about Democrats, and you look at it this way, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  they do stick together. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  They understand it's a team sport. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  And as you saw in that clip before with the Michigan Congresswoman, who she's saying, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=365.9s)]
*  we all vote together. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=371.26s)]
*  Now the Democrats are also facing what we've been talking about all morning, which is a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=372.94s)]
*  rebranding. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=378.78s)]
*  Here's Representative Dean Phillips from Minnesota. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=379.78s)]
*  And he says this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  He says, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=384.66s)]
*  And that means leadership right now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  We are totally devoid of leadership. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=394.62s)]
*  We're rudderless. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=396.86s)]
*  I don't know which Democratic Party member my colleagues would point to as the leader, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=397.86s)]
*  as the de facto leader. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=401.98s)]
*  And absent that, I don't see much, frankly, happening. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=403.22s)]
*  What's your thoughts on that? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=406.66s)]
*  And who do you think becomes that leader moving forward in this rudderless party, as [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=408.62s)]
*  Phillips describes it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=415.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=417.14s)]
*  And listen, as you guys know, I mean, he was a critic of President Biden running again from [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=418.14s)]
*  the beginning. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=421.14s)]
*  And he has been raising these concerns. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=422.14s)]
*  But many others have who are still a part of the party, including Congressman Ro Khanna, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  who's with us this morning on Fox News Sunday. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=428.46s)]
*  He's talked about the fact that we didn't listen to people. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=430.74s)]
*  We're going to the wrong positions on these culture war issues, that we're not using common [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=432.82s)]
*  sense on issues of crime and people feeling safe. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=437.88s)]
*  So there's a lot of introspection publicly and privately happening with the party. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=440.48s)]
*  One of the first big things they'll do is elect the new DNC chair. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=444.36s)]
*  And so a lot of people are looking to that to see, Ari, does that person become the leader [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=448.2s)]
*  of the party? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=452.08s)]
*  All the big guns were out for the last election, Presidents Clinton and Obama and others who [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=453.52s)]
*  are super popular. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=458.52s)]
*  And they didn't have a win with Vice President Harris. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=459.6s)]
*  So you know, that takes away a little bit of the luster from their leadership in the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=461.88s)]
*  party. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=465.8s)]
*  I think Democrats are still trying to figure that out themselves. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=467.72s)]
*  Shannon, what do you have coming up on Fox News Sunday? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=470.24s)]
*  But also, let me ask you this question as you tell us that as well, because we debated [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=473.04s)]
*  this this morning. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=476.32s)]
*  Do you think John Fetterman has a political ceiling higher than Senator from Pennsylvania? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=477.32s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=481.44s)]
*  I mean, his name keeps being floated out there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=483.48s)]
*  But listen, as much as Democrats have had their frustrations with him because he's really [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  tough on issues where he's not moving on Israel and its ability to defend itself at all costs, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=491.06s)]
*  the border he's called out his own party. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=497.26s)]
*  So he's made friends across the aisle. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=499.26s)]
*  But I don't know that he has enough of a strength within the Democrat Party to go beyond where [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=501.74s)]
*  he is now only because they may not want him to based on some of the things that he's saying. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=505.66s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=510.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRLpfRlbsIA&t=511.34000000000003s)]
