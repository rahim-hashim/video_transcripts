# 'DEATH WISH': Trump sends message to Newsom
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo)
*  All right, let's talk California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump will make his first presidential trip [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=1.8s)]
*  this week, visiting North Carolina first, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=3.84s)]
*  then over to California, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  as he criticizes state leaders there [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=8.64s)]
*  for mishandling the wildfires. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=11.0s)]
*  So, you know, everything was dry, and it was an inferno. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=13.5s)]
*  They created an inferno. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=17.1s)]
*  So we're demanding that they turn the valve [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=18.96s)]
*  back toward Los Angeles. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=21.26s)]
*  Why aren't they doing it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=22.5s)]
*  They either have a death wish, they're stupid, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=24.0s)]
*  or there's something else going on that we don't understand. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=27.1s)]
*  But we want the water that they're throwing away [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=30.26s)]
*  to be used for California. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=33.9s)]
*  This is Democrat Gavin Newsom spends his time [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=39.0s)]
*  Trump-proofing his state, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  slamming the president over climate executive actions, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=43.5s)]
*  saying, quote, if you don't believe in science, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=46.7s)]
*  believe your own damn eyes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=49.14s)]
*  Fox News contributor Steve Hilton joins us now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=51.1s)]
*  By the way, $50 million for lawyers to get ready [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  to sue back to make sure illegal aliens' rights are kept. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=57.06s)]
*  Your thoughts, Steve, about climate change, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=61.06s)]
*  Gavin Newsom's focus in these times of crisis. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=64.5s)]
*  Instead of focusing on attacking President Trump, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=66.7s)]
*  he should be asking for his help, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  and not in the way that a lot of people [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=71.12s)]
*  are thinking, all the money. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=72.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's important. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=74.62s)]
*  But more important is the expertise [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=75.76s)]
*  in two specific ways. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=78.0s)]
*  We've got to rebuild Los Angeles. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=79.72s)]
*  We've got huge events coming. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=81.76s)]
*  We've got the soccer world cup, the Super Bowl, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  the Olympics. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=86.92s)]
*  We have a builder as president. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=88.18s)]
*  Ask for his help. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=91.26s)]
*  He knows how to do this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=92.28s)]
*  We were just talking about drill baby, drill. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=93.52s)]
*  We need to build baby, build in California. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=97.22s)]
*  Not just rebuilding Los Angeles. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=99.72s)]
*  We need to build infrastructure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=102.16s)]
*  We need to build housing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=103.72s)]
*  He knows how to do that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=104.98s)]
*  The second thing is what's holding up things [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=106.18s)]
*  getting built in California? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=108.78s)]
*  Regulations, insane environmental regulations, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=110.18s)]
*  labor regulations. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump knows how to get rid of regulations. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=114.62s)]
*  We need to do that in California. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=117.02s)]
*  Well, he says, I'm cutting red tape, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=118.62s)]
*  meaning I'm going to cut some of those environmental [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  regulations, which is driving environmentalists crazy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  When Gavin Newsom and President Trump meet, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=125.12s)]
*  we think on Friday, should President Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  say exactly what he's been saying to us, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=129.26s)]
*  to Gavin Newsom's face? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=131.56s)]
*  Yes, because he's right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=132.86s)]
*  He's right about pretty much every single aspect of this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=134.32s)]
*  He's right that it was environmental regulations that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=138.02s)]
*  stopped the clearing of the brush that made the wildfires [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=141.12s)]
*  into a total inferno. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=144.58s)]
*  And he's right about the water. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=146.12s)]
*  Here's a simple way of thinking about it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=147.82s)]
*  The way it works in California, most of the people [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=149.68s)]
*  live in Southern California. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=151.88s)]
*  The water is in Northern California, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=153.68s)]
*  in the Sierra Mountains, Sierra Nevada, in the snowpack. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  So we have reservoirs and a whole system of canals. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  There are basically two canals bringing the water [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  from the north to the south. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=164.84s)]
*  One is owned by the state. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=166.24s)]
*  One is owned by the federal government, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=167.84s)]
*  built and owned by the federal government. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=169.44s)]
*  Trump, when he was last president, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  said, let's bring more water down by increasing the supply [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=173.44s)]
*  from down the federal canal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=178.34s)]
*  What Gavin Newsom did to stop the water being taken out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=180.68s)]
*  of the delta, where it comes from, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=184.48s)]
*  was to reduce the supply in the state pipeline, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=186.68s)]
*  to counteract it, which is insane. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=191.24s)]
*  Where's that where to go then? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=193.2s)]
*  It stays in the delta. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=194.32s)]
*  And that's the point that they're trying. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=195.8s)]
*  And Trump was saying, yes, they quite rightly, they're crazy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=197.48s)]
*  Why are they doing this? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=200.2s)]
*  They really are doing it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=201.56s)]
*  They call it environmental reasons. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=203.28s)]
*  It is to protect the fish that are in the delta. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=205.16s)]
*  Here's what's different now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=207.6s)]
*  You don't have to get some Democrats' attention [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=208.83999999999997s)]
*  or a Republican confirmed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Everybody was affected. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=212.72s)]
*  They said, when the firefighters went to the hydrants, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=214.1s)]
*  there was no water. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=218.92s)]
*  That's not a gray area. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  Why wasn't there water? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=221.56s)]
*  Let's pursue this as a Democrat and Republican. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=223.16s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=225.6s)]
*  And it leads this direction. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=226.2s)]
*  You have everyone's attention now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  Would this actually push you more to run for governor? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=229.72s)]
*  Well, as you know, Brian, we've talked about it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=233.56s)]
*  I am strongly considering it, because it's obvious now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=235.48s)]
*  We need massive change in California. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  Every single thing has been mismanaged. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=241.04s)]
*  The incompetence is off the charts, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  and people are seeing it now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=245.2s)]
*  And it's driven by this ideology, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  this far-left ideology. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  That's why there's not enough water. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=250.14s)]
*  That's why you've got all these regulations. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=252.04s)]
*  They don't want to build anything. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to have the kind of energy supply. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=255.08s)]
*  We talk about energy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  We have oil and gas reserves in California [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=258.76s)]
*  that we could be using. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=261.6s)]
*  Instead, we're importing it from countries [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=262.64s)]
*  like Saudi Arabia and Iraq. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=264.88s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=266.8s)]
*  By 2035, the only electric vehicles [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=267.6s)]
*  will be driven there, and we'll see if anyone's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  going to be still living there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po55RB0-_Eo&t=271.44s)]
