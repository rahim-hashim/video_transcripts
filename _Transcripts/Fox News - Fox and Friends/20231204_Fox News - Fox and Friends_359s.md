# Ronny Jackson: 'This is crazy and we're doing nothing'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU)
*  Let's bring in retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral and Republican Congressman from the great [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=0.0s)]
*  state of Texas, Ronnie Jackson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=4.12s)]
*  Sits on the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=6.04s)]
*  Joins us right now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=8.8s)]
*  I hope he's down in Texas somewhere. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=9.8s)]
*  Good morning to you, Admiral. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  How you guys doing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  We're doing okay, but we're scratching our heads, you know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  So now we're up to like 75 times. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=18.64s)]
*  These hooty rebels who once upon a time during the Trump administration used to be terrorists, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  they hit us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  And what do we do? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Rather than addressing the root cause, explain what the root cause is, Ronnie. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  Well the root cause is Iran and the root cause is our inability to respond to this kind of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=33.8s)]
*  stuff. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=37.68s)]
*  It's weakness coming from the White House that's been going on since the very early [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=38.68s)]
*  days with the Biden administration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=42.08s)]
*  And as you mentioned, Steve, the hooties were removed from the designated terrorist list. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  You know, President Trump had put them on the terror list and as soon as Biden got in, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=48.72s)]
*  he removed them from that list and we started giving them money and aid. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=52.8s)]
*  And now, you know, we're dealing with this and until we get aggressive with this, until [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=56.0s)]
*  we strike in a really meaningful way, this is not going to stop. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=60.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, us going after a few terrorists here and there in Iraq and Syria after these [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=65.68s)]
*  drone attacks, that's not going to do it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=71.36s)]
*  We need to go after the source and with regards to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=72.92s)]
*  strait there, which has become an increasingly dangerous place to operate for commercial [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=77.8s)]
*  shipping and obviously for our troops that are there on ships as well, we need to go [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=81.12s)]
*  after the hooties. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=87.36s)]
*  We need to strike where these missiles are coming from. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=88.64s)]
*  They're shooting missiles at ships, missiles and attack drones. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  We should be we should be neutralizing that stuff immediately. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  We should be sending Tomahawk missiles over there and taking these sites out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  Instead, we're doing nothing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=102.28s)]
*  And it's being perceived as complete weakness on our part. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=103.64s)]
*  It's only going to get worse until we get strong and do something about what's happening. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=107.24s)]
*  Yeah, Admiral, they're giving out TBI's like they're cookies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=111.84s)]
*  You've had the honor of serving three presidents, both parties, Democrat and Republican. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=115.32s)]
*  Leon Panetta was very critical in his statement over the weekend at the Ronald Reagan Library. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=121.52s)]
*  I guess my question to you is, what is different when it comes to this administration and the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=128.44s)]
*  way it responds to acts of aggression versus the three presidents that you serve? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=134.16s)]
*  Well, I think the three presidents I served would have been very decisive in what they did [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=142.4s)]
*  and what and what the response was. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=146.68s)]
*  I mean, they would have sent a an undeniable message that if you just like Leon Panetta [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=148.44s)]
*  had said this weekend, if you do this, you will die. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=153.48s)]
*  Right. And that's what we need to do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  We need to kill some of these people and take out some of these sites, the people that are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=157.92s)]
*  launching this stuff, not just responding in the local area, not killing these proxy terrorists. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=161.72s)]
*  Iran doesn't care about these proxy terrorists. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  If four or five of them die in a U.S. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=168.6s)]
*  airstrike, they don't care. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  That's not going to deter them at all. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=172.28s)]
*  We need to strike. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=174.0s)]
*  We need to cut the head off the snake, essentially. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=175.88s)]
*  And that's what I've seen done in the past. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=178.12s)]
*  I've seen decisive action taken and a message sent that if you continue to do this, the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  response will be overwhelming. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=184.8s)]
*  It will be more than what you're than what they're doing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=186.24s)]
*  So if they do something, as we should do something that's above and beyond what's been done to us [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=189.0s)]
*  and send that message to them that there will be a price to pay, it will be painful and you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=194.96s)]
*  will not be able to continue to operate in the way you've been operating. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=198.88s)]
*  And the Biden administration refuses to do that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=201.88s)]
*  And they're being driven by the progressive base right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=204.16s)]
*  That's, you know, that drags them in the wrong direction every time something like this happens. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  And they need to stop listening to them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=211.24s)]
*  They need to start doing what's in America's best interest and what's in our national security [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  interest. And they need to put a stop to this because it's going to it's going to it's going to escalate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=216.44s)]
*  into something really bad in the near future here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=221.24s)]
*  I mean, they're shooting they're shooting missiles and ships. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=223.4s)]
*  I don't know. You know, something bad is going to happen in the near future. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  You're not only a congressman, you were your retired U.S. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=230.36s)]
*  Navy rear admiral and you also are a physician. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=234.4s)]
*  So we wanted to talk to you about this next topic because there are five GOP senators. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=236.8s)]
*  It's Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance, Rick Scott, Tommy Turberville and Mike Braun, who have penned a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=241.24s)]
*  letter to Joe Biden asking him to ban travel from China to prevent this mystery respiratory [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=245.88s)]
*  illness from coming here to the United States. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=251.48s)]
*  Part of that letter says the Chinese Communist Party has a long history of lying about [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=253.84s)]
*  public health crises. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=258.44s)]
*  A ban on travel now could save our country from death, lockdowns, mandates and further [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=259.92s)]
*  outbreaks later. In your opinion, how serious is this illness? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=264.96s)]
*  What exactly is this illness? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=268.4s)]
*  And will Joe Biden listen to them? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=269.8s)]
*  Well, we don't know what this illness is. That's a big part of the problem. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=272.52s)]
*  We don't know if it's a viral illness. We don't know if it's an atypical bacteria like [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=275.12s)]
*  mycoplasma or something like that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=278.24s)]
*  We don't we don't know if it's a novel, a new novel virus, something that's natural, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=279.68s)]
*  something that's maybe been manipulated in a lab like like COVID was. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  What we do know is that we can't trust the Chinese. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  We cannot trust any information we get from the Chinese or from the World Health [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=291.0s)]
*  Organization. And sadly, we can't trust a lot of the information that we're getting from [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=294.72s)]
*  our own CDC and our own government. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=298.56s)]
*  That's that's what COVID taught us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=300.44000000000005s)]
*  It's very unfortunate, but COVID has taught us to be very mistrustful of all of this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=302.04s)]
*  information. And I think until we know what's going on, it's not a bad idea to exactly [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  what the senators were suggesting to shut the travel from China down right now until [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=310.0s)]
*  we figure out what's going on over there, because we don't know if this is going to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=315.04s)]
*  be the next the next big pandemic or not. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=318.68s)]
*  It doesn't look like it's going to be. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  But you know what? COVID didn't look that way to start with either. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=323.16s)]
*  And we were lied to about that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=325.8s)]
*  So we need to know what's happening. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=327.0s)]
*  And and we need to we need to be aggressive in our in our prevention in the interim. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, we don't know what we don't know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=335.44s)]
*  Ronnie, Dr. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=337.68s)]
*  Admiral, Congressman, has got the longest business card of any guest today. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocqS7uWqLDU&t=339.56s)]
