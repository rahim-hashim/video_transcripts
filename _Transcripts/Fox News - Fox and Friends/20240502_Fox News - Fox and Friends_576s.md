# Former FBI agent warns against 'lone-wolf' attack amid UCLA standoff
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w)
*  Now let's bring in retired Illinois Sergeant Betsy Brantner Smith and Rob D'Amico, former FBI agent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=0.0s)]
*  And Betsy, I'll begin with you. About two minutes ago during William Lajones' live shot, we saw [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  what appeared to be LAPD entering one of the buildings. Take us inside the mindset of law [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=12.0s)]
*  enforcement right now, specifically this notion of quote-unquote retreat. That seems like a passive [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=17.68s)]
*  word. It's not a positive word, but again, far be it for me to comment on police tactics not being [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=24.72s)]
*  in law enforcement. What do you think is happening with the LAPD, with the CHP right now? Well, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  remember the leadership is in the chancellor, the mayor, the governor. So those boots on the ground [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=37.76s)]
*  cops that we are seeing right now, they are following orders, but it seems to be very [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=45.76s)]
*  confusing as to what those orders are. You look at these cops and they have been standing around [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=52.4s)]
*  now for several hours. You've seen some of them look at their watches. They're ready to go with [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=58.0s)]
*  their gas masks, their flex cuffs. They want to go do something. But here's the thing. I know that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=62.56s)]
*  every one of those cops on that campus right now is thinking, am I going to get indicted for doing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=70.32s)]
*  my job this morning? What is going to happen when I finally do take action? You've got various [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=77.36s)]
*  skirmish lines like Bill talked about. You've got arrest teams. You've got perimeter teams. This is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=83.52s)]
*  a huge operation. It's a very dangerous operation. Everything everyone is seeing on the screen right [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=88.96s)]
*  now is a weapon. They have those posts, the hammers, the wood, all of that, all of those things [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=95.44s)]
*  they should not have been allowed to have. This is a situation that was allowed to get out of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=102.88s)]
*  control and now law enforcement, who the protesters want to abolish, has to come in and clean it up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  This is a really a leadership fail beyond law enforcement. And I think you make such an important [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  point, Betsy. Everybody's got a camera these days. They're just waiting to create that next [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=120.64s)]
*  viral video of what they label, not my words, what inevitably they're going to call police brutality. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  It is not police brutality. They are following their orders and they are trying to protect [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=130.72s)]
*  these people from themselves. Rob, former FBI agent, as you are, what is the Bureau doing right [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=134.72s)]
*  now, if anything, in response to these protests? Because we mentioned LAPD, that's local, CHP, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=141.68s)]
*  California Highway Patrol, that's state. What, if anything, are the feds being led by the FBI doing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=147.84s)]
*  right now? I think right now, they're providing support, but I think on the other side of it, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=152.72s)]
*  they're probably looking at some online communications. They talk about these [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=161.04s)]
*  agitators coming in and the people that aren't students agitating the ones that are there and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=164.72s)]
*  planning stuff. So I'm sure we're probably looking at some communications going on between those [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=170.4s)]
*  groups to see if it is an organizer across the country or if it's coming in from outside the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=175.36s)]
*  country in order to see if they're planning something more violent through those people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=180.56s)]
*  Betsy, I'm always curious when it comes to tactics. And I know this scene fairly well. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=186.4s)]
*  And our reporters, Bill Mollugin, William Lajoness, have also described this very well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=191.76s)]
*  The area where these protesters are is basically a football field. And it's a football field [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=196.96s)]
*  surrounded by buildings. Not an actual football field, but it's a college green area, if you will. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=203.84s)]
*  But it's surrounded by very tall buildings. So bring us inside the mindset, the tactician element [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=209.36s)]
*  of all this. What will law enforcement do with that as the physical setup? A green area, size of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=215.6s)]
*  a football field, surrounded by buildings with a very long set of very steep steps off to your left? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=222.4s)]
*  We've got to stay close together, keep an eye on each other. We want protester safety, but we also [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=229.92s)]
*  have to consider officer safety. And like you said earlier, this isn't just college students now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  We have outside agitators. There's a real good chance what happens in these situations very often [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=243.12s)]
*  is very nefarious characters start to move in. Gang bangers, things like that. People who want [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  to deal drugs, people who want to hurt cops, people who want to sexually assault young women. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=253.76s)]
*  So we have no idea what's in that crowd. It's not just a bunch of cheering, hooting college students. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  So again, we have got to keep an eye on each other. We've got to be able to communicate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=265.68s)]
*  And this is difficult because you've got three, four, five, six different law enforcement agencies. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=270.08s)]
*  We also have to make sure we are sticking to our task. If I'm a perimeter officer, I'm going to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  stay on the perimeter. If I'm on the team that moves into the building, then I'm going to be on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=282.4s)]
*  that team. But this is such an adrenaline dump for these cops. They've all been trained to do this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  But when you're walking into the unknown, you're walking into chaos, and again, I can't emphasize [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=295.76s)]
*  enough, they do not have the kind of leadership support by their leadership. You know, governor, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=301.68s)]
*  chancellor, everybody else, the mayor. And so they've also got to think, I have got to act so [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=310.48s)]
*  flawlessly here because it is going to be on tape. And no matter what I do, it's going to be used to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=316.4s)]
*  further incite the situation. Rob, you just heard Betsy mention these unseemly characters [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=323.12s)]
*  that could be infiltrating. You in your first answer alluded to the online work, let's say, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=328.56s)]
*  that the FBI is doing right now to pinpoint potential ties to terror and the like. How [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=333.2s)]
*  worried are you when you watch a scene like this unfolding where, and rightly so, law enforcement [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  is focused on all the things that Betsy just mentioned? How worried are you that a scene like [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=345.44s)]
*  this and a scene like Columbia and a scene like we're seeing all over our great land [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=350.24s)]
*  is ripe for a terror attack from a lone wolf or an organized group that is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=354.56s)]
*  just jumping into the chaos to sow even more chaos? I think that's their main goal. I mean, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=359.04s)]
*  they've been doing this across the nation for the information war. So I think more and more [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=366.32s)]
*  violence that they can stir up between the two that they're going to get the end results that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  they want. So when you see these now starting to happen and they're starting to happen at certain [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=377.44s)]
*  periods of time across the country, that's the goal to get on the news like they are now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=382.24s)]
*  But now when they can start stirring up a piece of violence in it, then they can say, again, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=387.84s)]
*  the police overreacted or whatever they're going to do. And they don't have to be true. They just, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=392.24s)]
*  they're going to take one thing, doesn't have to be true, and then they're going to run with it [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=397.84s)]
*  just as we saw back in like out of Gaza, the information war that was coming out from Hamas. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=401.52s)]
*  But beyond that, are you worried that we could see these scenes being used as an opportunity for [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=407.28s)]
*  a terror attack? You know, I'm not saying it's going to happen in the next 45 minutes while we're [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=414.4s)]
*  on air, but let's say this another day of this tomorrow because the powers that be have let this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  thing foam in. Could you see a lone wolf or an organized group or something seizing on this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=424.64s)]
*  moment to create a terror attack or if not that, just to use this as a dry run for one in the future? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. I think when you see these crowds and everything that's going on and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  based on what was happening in New York, they probably have made some plans altering what [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=443.2s)]
*  they're looking at doing. So you always have that and then you always have the lone wolf, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=447.76s)]
*  the lone wolf actor that may take the opportunity that just gets into this and then it is his or [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  her opportunity to do something that they want to personally get that response from. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=459.76s)]
*  Betsy, final question to you. It's 5 16 on the East Coast. Sun's about to come up here, but [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=464.56s)]
*  it's 2 16 on the West Coast. We have many more hours for the sun. How does that play into the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=469.44s)]
*  calculus from a law enforcement perspective? Do you want it light out? Do you want it dark out? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=474.8s)]
*  Are there benefits and detriments to both? What are your thoughts on that? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=480.64s)]
*  In this type of situation, I think operating in the light would be so much easier for these [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=485.12s)]
*  law enforcement professionals. Those strobe lights are very dangerous. They're very difficult [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=490.4s)]
*  on your eyesight. Were I the police leader in charge of this, I might button up that perimeter [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=495.44s)]
*  with all that personnel I have and then maybe look at you want to cut off the Wi-Fi, maybe cut off [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  the water, cut off the power, stop allowing them to enter and exit and then just wait them out and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=509.52s)]
*  ultimately starve them out. That might be a better tactic to wait until the light of day, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=517.2s)]
*  but let's not forget every one of these police departments that are there right now, they are [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=524.48s)]
*  short staffed already thanks to the defund the police movement and they are taking police [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=529.5200000000001s)]
*  resources away from the rest of the city and the rest of the county to deal with this nonsense [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=536.4000000000001s)]
*  that was self-created by the university. And that's taxpayer dollars paying for that. Another, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=543.44s)]
*  let's call it what it is, misuse of taxpayer dollars. Not that you don't need these cops on [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=549.2800000000001s)]
*  campus, you do, but just think you could have avoided this if there was some real leadership [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=553.84s)]
*  somewhere, somewhere in the state of California. Betsy and Rob, thank you for your time. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLl9EqW53w&t=558.96s)]
