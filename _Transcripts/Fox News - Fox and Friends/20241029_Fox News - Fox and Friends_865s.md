*  And as we saw Sunday, evening Sunday through the day, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=41.46s)]
*  was an amazing day and a lot of support out there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=46.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=49.86s)]
*  You've been through the campaign cycle now three times, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=50.7s)]
*  2016, 2020, 2024. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  How is this different? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=56.78s)]
*  Or how is it better? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  How is it different? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=59.2s)]
*  How does it compare? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  I feel it's kind of the same like 2016. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=63.96s)]
*  The support out there, it's incredible. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=68.2s)]
*  And it's just, you know, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  people see what's going on in the country [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=75.6s)]
*  and what kind of leadership they want. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=77.92s)]
*  You know, they want prosperity. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=81.12s)]
*  They want American dream coming back. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=82.76s)]
*  So that's what we will decide on November 5th. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=86.84s)]
*  It's got that feeling. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=90.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  You know, Mrs. Trump, you've made it very clear [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=92.72s)]
*  when your husband decided to run for president, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=94.64s)]
*  you were gonna be a mother, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=96.44s)]
*  you were gonna take care of Baron, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=97.4s)]
*  and you were gonna work on the projects in the White House, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  but that mattered to you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  But you took the stage on Sunday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  You surprised the former president, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=105.0s)]
*  you surprised the entire audience. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  Why now are we seeing you more on the campaign trail [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  in the final stretch? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=112.04s)]
*  Well, it was an incredible place. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  I love New York City, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  and I think that people to hear from me on that day, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  the arena, Madison Square Garden, the support that we have, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=123.8s)]
*  and I want to support my husband as well. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=128.04s)]
*  So I was there for him and everybody else. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=130.56s)]
*  Are you... [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=134.04s)]
*  I... [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=134.88s)]
*  I know you're like the former president, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=135.72s)]
*  doesn't want to count anything before it's done. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=142.08s)]
*  But if the polls are correct [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=144.54s)]
*  and you continue the momentum and you win, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=146.04s)]
*  are you anxious to be first lady again? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you want to be first lady again? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=150.2s)]
*  I'm not anxious because this time is different. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=152.68s)]
*  I have much more experience, much more knowledge. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=155.88s)]
*  I was in the White House before. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  So when you go in, you know exactly what to expect. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  You know what kind of people you need to get. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=167.04s)]
*  You need to have people that they are on your team, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  that they have the same vision as me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=172.88s)]
*  To serve me because they serve the country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=175.96s)]
*  The thing is, Melania, in your book, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=178.52s)]
*  you talk about people that really stabbed you in the back, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  and let you down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=183.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=184.56s)]
*  How did that feel to put that in print [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=185.4s)]
*  and finally get your voice to this story? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's important that people hear my story [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  because it's a lot of misinformation [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  and a lot of mistruths out there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=195.72000000000003s)]
*  So that's why I wrote the book. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=198.8s)]
*  And I always, I wish the best all these people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  that they go on the back and they need to heal, actually. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=206.04s)]
*  They need to heal. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=211.04s)]
*  I wish them all the best. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=211.88s)]
*  They should be there for the right reasons [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=213.56s)]
*  and not why they were there for. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  That's big of you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  A lot of people would be angry. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's betrayal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=220.04s)]
*  It's betrayal, but they show the world who they are. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=221.92s)]
*  They need to go to sleep every night [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=224.76s)]
*  and they know what they did. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=226.92s)]
*  To tape First Lady of the United States on the phone calls [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=228.28s)]
*  and release them to the public and edit those phone calls. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=233.28s)]
*  It's disgrace and should never happen to anybody. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  That has to be the hardest part because you trust. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=241.4s)]
*  Never happen in the history to somebody that would do that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=243.44s)]
*  You know, Mrs. Trump, do you feel [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=247.72s)]
*  that there's unfinished business at the White House? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=249.64s)]
*  Even for you, I know the former president [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=252.12s)]
*  talks about his agenda. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=254.48s)]
*  He wants to bring inflation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=255.56s)]
*  and wants to secure the border, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=256.72s)]
*  but you had projects as well. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=258.08s)]
*  Do you feel like you got to accomplish everything you wanted [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=260.08s)]
*  in the White House? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=262.92s)]
*  We did a lot, but it's still, it never ends. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=264.64000000000004s)]
*  It's so much to do and to take care of the staff [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=268.72s)]
*  and also the country and our next generation, our children. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=272.8s)]
*  I accomplished a lot with Be Best [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=277.48s)]
*  and brought Be Best internationally as well, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=279.36s)]
*  but so much to do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=283.6s)]
*  And so many new issues will come in 2025. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=285.72s)]
*  We never know what will come. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=291.12s)]
*  And children are suffering. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  We need to help them and educate them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=294.84s)]
*  Mrs. Trump, you said that this campaign cycle [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=298.08s)]
*  feels like 2016 in excitement and enthusiasm [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=300.8s)]
*  and things like that, I would imagine, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=306.56s)]
*  but something is different. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  And that is two different people tried to kill your husband [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=309.2s)]
*  and you saw it live on television. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=313.08s)]
*  This is all different. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=316.76s)]
*  It is different. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=318.52s)]
*  It's much more dangerous and I am very vigilant [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=319.36s)]
*  and very selective where I go, what do I do? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=323.56s)]
*  Because you never know. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=327.68s)]
*  It's one person and it's dangerous out there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  What do you think about the rhetoric [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  that's out there today? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  They're still calling your husband a second Hitler. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=336.36s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  Because you know him better than anyone. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  Correct, it's terrible. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=341.92s)]
*  He's not Hitler and all of his supporters, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=343.36s)]
*  they're standing behind him [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=346.32s)]
*  because they won't see country successful. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=347.64s)]
*  And we see what kind of support he has. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=351.32s)]
*  Why do you think he does this? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  He doesn't have to do it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=357.32s)]
*  We hear Eric Trump all the time say, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=358.64s)]
*  my dad could be on a beach, my dad could retire. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  He has these buildings and businesses. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=362.28s)]
*  Why do you all do this? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=365.08s)]
*  Why did you choose to do it again? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=366.24s)]
*  He loves his country and he wants to make it successful [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=367.88s)]
*  and for all of the people. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=373.0s)]
*  He loves people and he wants to make this country [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  great again. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=381.4s)]
*  Was the hardest part the court cases? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  Was that one of the hardest things, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  seeing the indictments and the court cases, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=386.11999999999995s)]
*  especially here in New York City? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=388.28s)]
*  Look, it's part of it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=389.84s)]
*  It's part of the politics. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=391.23999999999995s)]
*  When we came to the White House the first time [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=393.64s)]
*  when he was elected, I knew it would not be easy [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  and I knew they would go after him and they did. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=401.44s)]
*  So I always said, what is next? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=405.16s)]
*  Great. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=407.48s)]
*  Given the fact that there have been two assassination [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=408.32s)]
*  attempts, when he is at the door, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  he's about to go to work, do you say something different [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=415.8s)]
*  to him as you send him out the door? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=418.8s)]
*  I always said to him, be good luck and be safe. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=421.88s)]
*  You never know what kind of phone call you will receive [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=427.68s)]
*  and what can happen in life. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=430.36s)]
*  Life is fragile and we need to enjoy it every day. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=433.44s)]
*  Do you feel like God has a purpose now for him? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=436.8s)]
*  Because this has been two attempts and he's been spared. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=438.84s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=442.0s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=442.84s)]
*  Mrs. Shreve, are you okay with audience questions? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=443.68s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=445.6s)]

*  Where are you gonna spend election night with your family? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=451.24s)]
*  Hopefully a celebration. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=454.72s)]
*  Wait, is this an invitation to your house? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=455.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=457.92s)]
*  We will be in Palm Beach and in the morning, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=458.76s)]
*  we will go to vote. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=463.96s)]
*  Me and my husband will go to vote and then it will be, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, a waiting time, a period of waiting [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=470.88s)]
*  and we will see and then I hope it's a success [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=474.48s)]
*  and a party in the evening. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=478.52s)]
*  Do you think that we'll know on Tuesday night? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=480.4s)]
*  Well, I hope so. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=483.44s)]
*  I hope that we know. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=484.76s)]
*  I hope that election will be fair [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=485.88s)]
*  and everything will be, you know, selected, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=489.32s)]
*  as we say, on Tuesday night. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=493.04s)]
*  All right, Joanne, where are you? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=496.12s)]
*  Joanne, where do we find you? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=497.56s)]
*  There you go. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=498.68s)]
*  Mrs. Trump, it's a real honor to have you here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=499.68s)]
*  I wanna tell you thank you. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=502.8s)]
*  I appreciated your beautiful words and descriptions [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=504.32s)]
*  of New York City during the rally [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=507.44s)]
*  and my question to you is, how did you present [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=510.4s)]
*  or drop your little pro-choice bombshell on the president [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  in the middle of his career fight for his career? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=520.36s)]
*  How did you present it to him [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=525.0799999999999s)]
*  and what was his response to you? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, my husband knew my position, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=530.0s)]
*  my belief since the day we met. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  So it was not a big surprise for him, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=536.8s)]
*  I guess other people, the world didn't know [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=540.92s)]
*  where my stands are, but he was not surprised at all. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=543.64s)]
*  He knew about it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=548.56s)]
*  All right, Barbara. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=549.76s)]
*  She writes about it in detail in her book, if you wanna. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=553.76s)]
*  I do, I do. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=555.24s)]
*  In the book, it's like a whole chapter about it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=556.08s)]
*  So I really explain what I really believe, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=559.72s)]
*  what really means my body, my choice. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not one way only, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=565.76s)]
*  So if somebody's interested, they should read it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=568.24s)]
*  All right, Barbara's got a question right over there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=572.6s)]
*  Hey, Barbara. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  Yes, thank you so much for taking our questions. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=575.52s)]

*  And as a grandmother of seven little ones, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=583.32s)]
*  I'm wondering, do you have any advice or words of wisdom [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=586.0s)]
*  for our young mothers who are working so hard [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=590.4s)]

*  It's a busy time. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  I would say that lead with love [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=601.48s)]
*  and take a child as individual. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=604.6s)]
*  We are all different. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=609.44s)]
*  And also make sure that you, as a mother, you are healed [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=611.24s)]
*  so you don't put the issues and trauma [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=618.2s)]
*  and everything to your child. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=621.16s)]
*  Be cautious and be very, very loving. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY18-Plb398&t=623.32s)]
