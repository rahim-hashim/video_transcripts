# Steve Moore: This is the ‘most conservative bill’ I’ve seen in my lifetime #foxnews #news #shorts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U)
*  But you know, there's so much in this bill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm so tired of Democrats saying, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=2.6s)]
*  oh, this is just a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=3.88s)]
*  No, every single family in America that pays taxes, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=6.04s)]
*  on average, gets about a $2,000 reduction in their taxes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=9.68s)]
*  And then every small business man and woman, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=12.96s)]
*  who, as you know, small businesses [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=15.44s)]
*  are the backbone of our economy, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=17.44s)]
*  they're major employers, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=18.96s)]
*  they see about a 20% reduction in their taxes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=20.2s)]
*  If you like a school choice for parents, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=23.96s)]
*  there's an expansion of school choice. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=27.44s)]
*  If you like health savings accounts, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=29.36s)]
*  so people can have more control of their health care money, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=30.76s)]
*  that's in this bill. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=33.08s)]
*  If you hate Joe Biden's, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=34.2s)]
*  remember the student loan forgiveness scam, that's gone. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=37.68s)]
*  I mean, I could go, oh, what about drill, baby, drill? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=41.6s)]
*  We're gonna do more drilling in this bill. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=43.88s)]
*  It allows for more mining, allows for more timber sales. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I could go on and on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  This is a great bill, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=50.68s)]
*  maybe the most conservative bill I've seen in my lifetime. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQAp7ro64U&t=51.96s)]
