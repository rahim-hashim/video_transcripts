*  This is just the first one we're hit, we're hitting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=13.46s)]
*  We've got other places that we are going to hit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=17.96s)]
*  We are onto you and we're coming for you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=20.28s)]
*  We know where you are and we're coming for you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=23.1s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=26.66s)]
*  A hotel in El Paso forced to shut down due to migrant crime. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=27.66s)]
*  All this happening on Vice President Harris' watch. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=31.42s)]
*  Somebody who's watching all of it is the co-host of The Five, Judge Jeanine Pirro joins us [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=36.1s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=39.96s)]
*  Judge, good morning to you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=40.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=41.96s)]
*  You know, San Antonio firefighters are being warned, hey, when you go to fight a fire, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=42.96s)]
*  look out for some of these gang members. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=47.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=49.42s)]
*  Aren't their jobs tough enough already? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=50.42s)]
*  Well, they are tough enough already, but what we have and what has happened in this country [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=51.82s)]
*  The gang, specifically Trende Aragua, has already identified police as those people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  that they want to basically destroy and beat up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=63.94s)]
*  So firefighters and first responders are being misinterpreted as being police officers. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=67.58s)]
*  So these gangs go after them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=73.9s)]
*  And that's why the police chief was just saying, we're coming for you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=75.7s)]
*  They're not only engaged in drug trafficking, human trafficking, robberies, they're using [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=78.86s)]
*  apartment buildings as the base of criminal operations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=84.14s)]
*  And in this sting that they did where they took down so many of them, they found out [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=87.86s)]
*  several of them had warrants already. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=92.5s)]
*  They were illegal in this country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=94.54s)]
*  And several of them had been deported but came back to the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=96.44s)]
*  And there's a story that has terrified much of north central Texas around Dallas because [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=99.78s)]
*  apparently four members of a gang followed some lady into her garage in Dallas and then [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=106.38s)]
*  beat her up for a while, threatened to cut off her fingers unless they give her the money. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=113.42s)]
*  They went up with $75,000 worth of stuff. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=118.14s)]
*  Apparently they've arrested them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=121.26s)]
*  But still, that poor woman, you know, she's never going to forget that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=122.5s)]
*  Well, you know, they wanted her jewelry. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  Apparently they identified her based upon the jewelry she was wearing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=128.22s)]
*  They followed her into the garage. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=131.38s)]
*  And in the end, the question is, number one, do these people get caught in sanctuary cities [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=133.9s)]
*  where they're not going to be held accountable or if they're deported, are they coming back? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=139.38s)]
*  This is a real problem. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=144.74s)]
*  This is a criminal gang from Venezuela whose job it is to commit crime and eliminate the police. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=145.92s)]
*  Speaking of sanctuary cities, you've got a brand new special available now on Fox Nation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=151.94s)]
*  We've got a sound bite. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=158.06s)]
*  Go ahead and set it up. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=159.26s)]
*  And what we're about to hear. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=160.78s)]
*  Well, you know, what we're about to hear is from the mother of a young girl who went out [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=161.78s)]
*  to start her life, got two jobs and was a little uncomfortable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=167.54s)]
*  She was living next to a guy who was illegal but decided to say nothing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=171.62s)]
*  He ends up killing her. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=175.62s)]
*  And this whole Fox Nation special is about why do we have sanctuary cities in America? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=176.82s)]
*  What are we going to do about them? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=182.42s)]
*  Why are illegals being protected? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=184.06s)]
*  Why are illegals signing allegiance to violent gangs in their own country instead of respecting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=185.94s)]
*  America that's giving them everything? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  This special delves into what we're going to do about this problem. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=195.02s)]
*  All right, let's watch that sound bite that the judge just set up. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  Many states that refuse to provide information regarding illegals who are committing crimes [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=205.22s)]
*  once they've illegally crossed the border, the thinking is they don't want to discriminate [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  against them because they are illegal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=218.58s)]
*  Very angry. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=220.5s)]
*  Like, why are we protecting them? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=221.5s)]
*  We need to be protected. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=224.18s)]
*  Everyone that's living here legally in the United States needs to be protected. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=226.22s)]
*  That looks great, Judge. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=231.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's Tammy Noble. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=232.82s)]
*  She is the mother of a young girl who was murdered by a by illegal alien. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=234.18s)]
*  And in the end, he was caught. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=240.78s)]
*  He was just convicted. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=243.18s)]
*  But now she and so many others who've lost their loved ones have made a decision that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=244.86s)]
*  what they're going to do is they're going to get America organized, get us on notice [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=249.22s)]
*  as to what's happening, where it's happening and what we can do about it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=254.34s)]
*  And that's why this Fox Nation special is compelling. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=258.1s)]
*  Go to Fox Nation right now and it's right there on the home page. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=261.34s)]
*  All right, Judge, thank you very much. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=264.38s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=266.38s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3onLH1d3DI&t=267.38s)]
