**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs)
*  All right, let's get going. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox News alert, President-elect Trump will leave Mar-a-Lago any moment and head to Washington [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=2.6s)]
*  at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=7.62s)]
*  Hell of a stop before that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=9.16s)]
*  First, he is going to meet with President Biden, the first time they've met since Trump's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=10.52s)]
*  historic election victory. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=15.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=17.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's incoming cabinet is taking shape by the hour as he appoints some very [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=18.04s)]
*  familiar faces in key roles for his second administration. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=22.88s)]
*  Right on Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans will hold a vote on the upper chamber's new [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=27.4s)]
*  leadership. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=31.799999999999997s)]

*  Hey, Mark. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=47.12s)]
*  Ainsley, Steve, Brian and Lawrence, good morning, friends. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=48.12s)]
*  As the president-elect gets ready to head to Washington for a series of high-profile [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=51.56s)]
*  meetings, we are learning new details about who he hopes to serve with him in a second [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=55.24s)]
*  Trump term. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=58.96s)]
*  And as you guys mentioned, some of these names are familiar and even friends of ours on this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=59.96s)]
*  morning's show. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Overnight Trump announcing that Pete Hegseth, the bestselling author, the combat veteran [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=65.04s)]
*  and co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend, will lead the Department of Defense. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=69.4s)]
*  Trump writing, nobody fights harder for the troops and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  champion of our peace through strength policy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=78.28s)]
*  Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe is heading back to the government. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=81.48s)]
*  He's Trump's pick for CIA director. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=84.84s)]
*  He's spoken out frequently about the threat China and Iran pose. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  He's also accused some in the intelligence community of political misinformation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=90.56s)]
*  Trump writing Ratcliffe has been a warrior for truth and honesty with the American public. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=95.04s)]
*  When 51 intelligence officials were lying about Hunter Biden's laptop, there was one, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=99.28s)]
*  Ratcliffe, telling the truth to the American people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=103.56s)]
*  This morning, two of Trump's most high-profile supporters, billionaire businessman Elon Musk [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=106.36s)]
*  and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=111.96s)]
*  or DOGE. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=115.96s)]
*  Now, this is not something that currently exists, but Trump says it's going to be a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=116.96s)]
*  way to shrink the size of government. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump writing overnight, together these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=122.72s)]
*  my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies essential to the Save America movement. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=132.0s)]
*  Now what's a little different about this one is this is not a department that I said exists [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  right now, so we're waiting to see how Congress may adapt to it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=141.72s)]
*  Is this something that has to be funded or is this more going to be an informal role? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=144.68s)]
*  These are questions that will come out a little bit later on throughout the transition. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  We're also still waiting for a number of other key posts to be filled, including press secretary, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  and there's been some rumblings that Alina Habba, who was on Trump's legal defense team, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=156.0s)]
*  may be tapped for that role, but no official announcements at this point should be a very [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  busy day for the president-elect. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  Steve Ainsley, Brian and Lawrence Beck. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  All right, Mark, thank you for the report. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=167.56s)]
*  You can turn around and watch the sun come up down there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=169.4s)]
*  Hey, look at that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=171.8s)]
*  How beautiful is that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  It's really pretty. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  So yesterday, and I'm sure this happened in a lot of American homes yesterday, so I'm [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  looking at Twitter for a moment, or X, because I noticed that Peter Ducey was trending on [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  Twitter and it turns out because he's being suggested for press secretary. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=185.88s)]
*  And that's just so funny to me because it's like, oh, come on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  And then I saw this thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=195.56s)]
*  Pete Hegseth has been named the nominee for press secretary, or rather for secretary of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=197.24s)]
*  defense, and I thought, well, is that real? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=202.48s)]
*  And then it started to like a gusher. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=206.24s)]
*  All this news that essentially caught Washington totally off guard, Pete Hegseth, the guy on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=209.04s)]
*  the couch, is Donald Trump's selection to be the secretary of defense. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  And we are all, you know, friends with Pete. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=221.4s)]
*  We've known him for a long time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=223.16s)]
*  The military is his world. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=224.56s)]
*  I mean, that is his mission in life. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=226.12s)]
*  He was in the Army National Guard infantry. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=227.44s)]
*  He was an infantry officer. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  He served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  He was a guard at Gitmo. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  He had two Bronze Stars, combat infantry badge. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  He used to run Concerned Veterans for America as the CEO. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=239.84s)]
*  Of course, he was 10 years here at the Fox News Channel, has a degree from Princeton [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  and Harvard. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=248.08s)]
*  So when you look at the former, now the president-elect thinking, Pete just finished in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  his entire book, Taking on the Military, The Wokeness in the Military, and What's Been [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=254.4s)]
*  Going on in the Military, always been a friend of the former president. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=258.24s)]
*  And he wants someone to go in there that's going to clean it up and focus on the mission, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=262.72s)]
*  which is to keep Americans safe, not targeting the men and women from the inside, but the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=267.32s)]
*  people foreign. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=272.72s)]
*  And I think he's going to keep Elon Musk and the very close because they got to be cutting. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  They got to make doing, we're going to talk about that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=278.12s)]
*  They got to be cutting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=279.88s)]
*  They got to make government more efficient. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=280.88s)]
*  They got to try the best they can. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=281.88s)]
*  They're two of the best in the country at doing it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=283.08s)]
*  But I also think that I remember when Mattis took over and everyone's like, well, you know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=285.08s)]
*  he's used to fighting wars. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  How's he going to do it? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  What you do is you have a great chief of staff or assistant deputy secretary of defense that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  knows the ins and outs of it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  And what you have in Pete is you got to go into instead of just going to the military, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=296.88s)]
*  he goes into the infantry like Tom Cotton. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=300.56s)]
*  So he knows Iraq, he knows Afghanistan. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=303.08s)]
*  The other thing he knows is Israel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  And he's been there like seven, eight times, done multiple specials there as a real passion [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  for the region and understanding of the challenges in the West Bank and Gaza, not just on pro-Israel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=311.56s)]
*  I understand the region. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=317.2s)]
*  So I think it's a fascinating pick. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=319.24s)]
*  And you don't realize how qualified he is until you really look at the resume. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=321.28s)]
*  Look at the resume. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=326.12s)]
*  I teach, I the Ivy League thing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=327.12s)]
*  And then he says, I understand that school. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=328.96s)]
*  I understand what it's like there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  I know what it's like in the Midwest. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=332.24s)]
*  I grew up there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  I know what it's like to have a young family. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm dealing with a situation right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=336.35999999999996s)]
*  I know what it's like to work on a ranch now. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=339.28s)]
*  And then you come in with its military background. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=341.96s)]
*  I think it's going to be a fascinating pick. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  And you're not going to be able to outwork him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=346.4s)]
*  Yeah, if you doubt his intelligence on a matter, just anytime we have a foreign conflict, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=347.84s)]
*  look at him at a map. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=352.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=353.55999999999995s)]
*  He knows all the regions very well. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=354.55999999999995s)]
*  And he's confident and he doesn't care. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=357.08s)]
*  He's like Tom Homan. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  He doesn't care what anyone thinks. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  No, he doesn't. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  He does not. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  He's like a cousin to all of us, a great guy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  They are expecting it will be a fight, a confirmation fight. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  There were some veterans groups that lined up against him last time in 2016 when he was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=372.0s)]
*  suggested for VA secretary. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  But to your point, Lawrence, the number one book that's going to be sold today at the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=379.72s)]
*  Barnes and Noble over in Crystal City by the Pentagon is Pete's book War on Warriors, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  where he essentially describes what needs to be dismantled at the Pentagon because that's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  probably his blueprint. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=394.64s)]
*  He's also got the series on vaccination. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=396.48s)]
*  How about Elon and Vivek, I mean, two very successful businessmen. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=399.48s)]
*  Elon, you know, PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=404.68s)]
*  Richest man in the world. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=408.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=409.24s)]
*  Gave all those Starlinks to the people in North Carolina. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=410.24s)]
*  And so they're tasked with it's to run Doge, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=412.6s)]
*  Is that how you pronounce it? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=416.8s)]
*  Doge. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=417.8s)]
*  And he posted on X. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=418.8s)]
*  Like the crypto. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=419.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=420.8s)]
*  All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=421.8s)]
*  transparency, basically like where your tax dollars are going and the pork. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=425.08s)]
*  Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  just let us know. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=434.24s)]
*  We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=435.52s)]
*  This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=441.12s)]
*  So I would add to this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=445.4s)]
*  Everybody talks about, you know, we have thirty six trillion dollars in debt and we have we're [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=449.2s)]
*  over a trillion dollars on the budget that we draw up. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=453.88s)]
*  We're overdrawn by seven hundred billion to a trillion every year. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  They go grow away out of it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=460.44s)]
*  Well, it's going to be hard. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=461.44s)]
*  Well, it's cut programs. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=462.44s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of programs like the school lunch program and other programs that really [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=463.44s)]
*  people depend on. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  So you're going to cut Social Security, going to cut Medicare, Medicaid. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  Then they talk about efficiency. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  If we could just become leaner as an organization. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=473.8s)]
*  Well, how do you do that? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=476.16s)]
*  You take two people known for doing that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=477.82s)]
*  One ran on just making the government more efficient. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=480.22s)]
*  And the other one has done it with seven of the most important companies in the country [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=483.32s)]
*  from scratch. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=487.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=488.64s)]
*  He will come in. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=489.64s)]
*  He'll blow it up. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=490.64s)]
*  If you don't like him, he's only working for a dollar, probably. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=491.64s)]
*  So you could try to fire him. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=494.88s)]
*  But if you don't want to cut programs, you don't want to cut spending and you want to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=496.55999999999995s)]
*  have growth, what you got to do is make the government more efficient. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  This is what's got to happen. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=504.28s)]
*  So one of their goals right now, according to some of them, what I'm hearing from some [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=505.32s)]
*  of the sources is to put everything digitally. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=509.8s)]
*  So for example, you want to know what's happened in the Department of Energy. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=513.64s)]
*  You want to know the dollar amount down to the cent that you'll be able to figure out [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  where every single penny is going from the government. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=520.24s)]
*  Now, Ohio did the same thing under Josh Mandel when he was over the Treasury. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=523.28s)]
*  They're trying to do the same thing for the country as well. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=527.8s)]
*  So with more eyes on where the money is going, they're hoping it'll be easier to cut those [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=531.36s)]
*  programs. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=536.88s)]
*  And you know, the whole idea of efficiency is great to run on. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=537.96s)]
*  It's a little complicated to implement because so many have tried. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=541.12s)]
*  But you know, Elon Musk is such a brilliant guy, you know, with all of his things and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=544.84s)]
*  with them working with him. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=549.96s)]
*  The only worry that people have is the way that their appointment was announced. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=552.06s)]
*  And keep in mind, they're not they do not have to go through a confirmation hearing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=558.04s)]
*  is Trump said the new department will be advising from the outside of the government. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  So that suggests that they won't really have any power to make the cuts, but they will [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=568.92s)]
*  be able to advise the White House. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=577.04s)]
*  And this is why it's always so effective out on the campaign trail is, you know, taxes [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  are just a fact of life. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=583.56s)]
*  We have to pay taxes to the federal government. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=585.28s)]
*  And we hate it when Washington wastes the money. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=588.48s)]
*  And essentially what they're going to do, they're going to have a great big spotlight. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=591.58s)]
*  They're going to say, look at all the money we're wasting right there. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=594.0200000000001s)]
*  Can we do something about that? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=596.88s)]
*  And then people go, you know what, if we if we take money from there, then we can either [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=598.58s)]
*  save the money or spend the money on something else we need. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=603.1800000000001s)]
*  Vivek has been a staunch supporter of Donald Trump. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=605.7800000000001s)]
*  He also went to Harvard and Yale. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=608.48s)]
*  He's really good friends with J.D. Vance. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=610.1s)]
*  Mike Huckabee is going to be the ambassador to Israel and John Ratcliffe, who was the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=612.14s)]
*  former director of national intelligence. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=616.74s)]
*  He was a congressman from Texas from Texas, and he has been nominated as CIA head. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=618.74s)]
*  He was the one who exposed the Russia collusion. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=624.62s)]
*  He was the one who exposed the FBI's FISA court abuse and Hunter laptop. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  So go ahead, Brian. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=632.82s)]
*  I would just say this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=634.86s)]
*  Radcliffe, a lot of people thought A.G. he was going to have a valuable spot. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=635.86s)]
*  I think he's been playing a pretty good role with Lutnick, Howard Lutnick in order because [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=639.58s)]
*  he knows government and Lutnick knows people in his systems and doing evaluation. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=644.74s)]
*  They were talking about how Lutnick would say on the five people that he would give [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=649.34s)]
*  for every position minimum, you touch their you touch their their picture and there goes [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=653.38s)]
*  their resume and what he what he thought their interview was like. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=658.58s)]
*  So Radcliffe was going to pretty much have the key spot, and he could have done director [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=661.74s)]
*  of national intelligence. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=666.1s)]
*  But in the sense that, you know, I did that already. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=667.1s)]
*  So I've been working the phones this morning and last night trying to get because he was [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=670.0200000000001s)]
*  on the short list, as you noted, for attorney general. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=674.34s)]
*  And apparently one of the pitches that he made to the president is that the CIA is a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=678.58s)]
*  real mess right now when it comes to the leadership there. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=682.86s)]
*  And they need to clean it out and get back to what needs to be the central function of [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  the agency. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=690.6600000000001s)]
*  And he didn't want to go to national intelligence, which oversee the CIA. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  So he settled here. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=697.82s)]
*  The other name that I'm hearing this morning as well is the next batch of nomination is [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=699.0600000000001s)]
*  going to be attorney general and FBI director. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=703.22s)]
*  And I'm hearing cash Patel. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=706.74s)]
*  This has not been confirmed. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=709.0600000000001s)]
*  The president has not made a form, a final decision on that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=710.38s)]
*  But he wants to clean house there next. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=714.34s)]
*  So I also talked to somebody with the incoming administration. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=717.34s)]
*  I said, what's going on with Rubio? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=720.7s)]
*  Is there something wrong? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  I goes, he's still on track. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=723.1800000000001s)]
*  And they said, absolutely on track. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=724.98s)]
*  So it just hasn't been named yet. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=727.1600000000001s)]
*  And that there's a thought doing these waves. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=728.98s)]
*  Maybe there's some people within the Trump team that don't want him. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=731.18s)]
*  I think even Fetterman, Fetterman even said he would be a great pick. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=734.7399999999999s)]
*  Easily. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=738.26s)]
*  He couldn't be a better pick. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=739.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=740.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=741.26s)]
*  But it is curious. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=742.26s)]
*  He hasn't named him yet. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=743.26s)]
*  So the big thing then, if Rubio becomes secretary of state, Ron DeSantis would have to essentially [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=744.26s)]
*  appoint somebody to fill his seat. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=751.38s)]
*  I was talking to a really smart person down in Florida politics yesterday. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=753.78s)]
*  And you know, the conventional wisdom. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=758.02s)]
*  And we were talking about this yesterday on the couch, is that Ron DeSantis would appoint [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=759.54s)]
*  a Republican congress member from Florida. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=763.9s)]
*  Byron Donnells, Brian Mass, somebody like that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=767.0999999999999s)]
*  The problem is the House majority is so narrow, they really don't have any anywhere to go. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=770.38s)]
*  And so they got to look elsewhere. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=776.3s)]
*  There is a possibility, I am told by a really smart person down in Florida, that Ron DeSantis [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=778.14s)]
*  either appoints himself or his wife to the job. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=784.3s)]
*  And if he appoints himself, his wife could run for governor down there. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=789.0999999999999s)]

*  He has been a very effective governor, conservative governor. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=798.9s)]
*  They love him. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=801.76s)]
*  I mean, this is just speculation. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=802.76s)]
*  But it is one of those things he actually could do. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=804.06s)]
*  But the first boxcar that has got to move is Marco Rubio. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=805.92s)]
*  He has got to be named and confirmed for it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=809.0999999999999s)]
*  Has his wife expressed interest in politics? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tneI0hsOWhs&t=810.8199999999999s)]
