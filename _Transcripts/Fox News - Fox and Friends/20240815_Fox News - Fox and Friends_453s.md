# Lawrence Jones: This really shocked me
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY)
*  Well, former President Donald Trump is holding a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=5.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris still hasn't held a press conference or sit down [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=6.44s)]
*  to interview in 25 days. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=10.14s)]
*  She and President Biden are making their first joint trip together since Biden dropped out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=13.0s)]
*  of the race. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=16.78s)]
*  Griff Jenkins is live in Washington with the details. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=17.78s)]
*  Hey, Griff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=20.68s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=21.68s)]
*  Somebody queued peaches and herb reunited because they are back together again in Maryland. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=22.68s)]
*  President and Harris will be at a White House event, and they're going to be touting lower [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=28.2s)]
*  costs for Americans, where we expect the current president to continue to claim victory over [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=31.4s)]
*  the pain Americans have been feeling in their pocketbooks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=37.1s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=39.6s)]
*  I told you we're going to have a soft landing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=42.76s)]
*  We're going to have a soft landing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=46.44s)]
*  My policies are working. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=47.68s)]
*  Start writing that way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=49.08s)]
*  But we're learning, while Harris will be by Biden's side today, she is expected to put [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=51.08s)]
*  her and her boss tomorrow during an economic address in the Tar Heels state. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=56.62s)]
*  Now, Axios writes this quote, Harris won't say it this bluntly in public, but her advisors [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=60.78s)]
*  do so privately. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=66.1s)]
*  She wants to break with Biden on issues on which he's unpopular. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=67.25999999999999s)]
*  First up, rising prices. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=71.14s)]
*  This is part of a highly choreographed effort to define her redefine herself at the White [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=72.94s)]
*  House. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=77.9s)]
*  Our own Peter Doocy press, Corrine Jean-Pierre on it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=78.9s)]
*  Axios is now reporting that she is hoping to distance herself from President Biden's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=82.5s)]
*  unpopularity on the economy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=86.86s)]
*  Can you blame her? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=90.3s)]
*  Do you know this is the Biden-Harris administration? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=91.3s)]
*  Are you aware that this is the Biden-Harris administration? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=93.26s)]
*  She is indeed the vice president. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=95.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, will today be the day? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  It has been 25 days and counting since Harris did a one on one interview or held a press [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=100.42s)]
*  conference, something, as you mentioned, Trump will do later today in Bedminster. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=105.58s)]
*  Guys. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=111.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=112.06s)]
*  Thank you so much, Griff. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=113.06s)]
*  Yesterday, Donald Trump really stuck to the issues, and that's what many people have been [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  calling him to do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  Don't focus on this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  He had fire in his belly yesterday. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=121.7s)]
*  Really just focus on the issues. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=122.7s)]
*  And he said, do you feel richer under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=123.7s)]
*  And he went through the fact that price hikes have cost the average American household $28,000. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=127.42s)]
*  Credit card debt has exploded. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=133.78s)]
*  Mortgages have tripled. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=135.74s)]
*  In July alone, 350,000 people were added to the unemployment rolls. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=136.94s)]
*  And he said Kamala needs to explain this present suffering that she's caused along with Joe Biden. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=141.38s)]
*  She's caused along with Joe Biden, Ainsley, because from day one, they've touted this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=148.38s)]
*  as the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=152.5s)]
*  How she can now separate herself from Joe Biden and most specifically, binomics, the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  policies that have led to inflation will be a neat trick. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=161.26s)]
*  We know how she'll pull that rabbit out of a hat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=164.18s)]
*  She'll do it with the aid of the media, which hasn't required her not only just answer a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=166.7s)]
*  question or do a press conference or sit down for an interview, but explain, explain exactly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=170.54s)]
*  how it is. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=174.74s)]
*  You are new and fresh and you're going to fix the problems on a team to be part of creating [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=176.38s)]
*  the problems. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=182.38s)]
*  What are you going to do differently? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=183.38s)]
*  You've been you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=184.38s)]
*  It's interesting because this is like the third or fourth reboot of Kamala Harris. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=186.14s)]
*  They tried to reboot her when she was vice president. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=190.66s)]
*  They gave her all the pet projects to try to change her image. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=192.46s)]
*  This is after the staff complained about her not reading the briefing books, not being [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=195.5s)]
*  ready to get delivered to the talking points when she did interviews. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=199.86s)]
*  But Donald Trump really tackled this when it comes to the economy here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  He said, is she prepared to tackle this on day one when she already has been vice president [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=206.74s)]
*  three and a half years? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=212.9s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  Kamala has declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  Think of it for her. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=222.34s)]
*  But day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  Why hasn't she done it? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=228.06s)]
*  By repealing the Biden Harris regulatory onslaught, we can save an estimated twenty thousand dollars. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=229.46s)]
*  And you're talking about a tremendous amount, six, seven, eight thousand dollars a year, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=235.5s)]
*  just in savings. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  So to get to economic relief to workers and families, we will make additional tax cuts. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=244.34s)]
*  That's what gave us the great economy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=250.58s)]
*  We'll make tax cuts additionally. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=253.22s)]
*  We'll make them permanent. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  Real quickly, we were just talking of the backdrop of Donald Trump when it says no tax [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=257.86s)]
*  on tips, no tax on Social Security. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=263.14s)]
*  They've obviously lifted no tax on tips from Donald Trump without giving him credit for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=265.82s)]
*  it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=270.22s)]
*  But the no tax on Social Security is interesting because remember, one of the left's talking [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=271.22s)]
*  point is that he's going to end Social Security. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  So now he's come out and said that he's not going to tip on Social Security. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=277.74s)]
*  That puts them in a box. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  Are they going to match his policy? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  And I'm not sure they can really use the same old talking point that he wants to get rid [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=285.98s)]
*  of it when he's saying no taxes on it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and he brought up a good point. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=291.26s)]
*  He said, quote, this cruel double taxation of Social Security benefits. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=292.98s)]
*  It's true. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=297.42s)]
*  We are taxed in our paychecks. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=298.42s)]
*  Money is taken out to give to Social Security. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  Then we get our Social Security checks after a certain age. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=302.7s)]
*  And then you're taxed again. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=305.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's double taxation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=306.86s)]
*  And here's a bit of good news for Donald Trump. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, there's been some talk about the Kamala Momentum and she's in this honeymoon [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=311.58s)]
*  period. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=315.34s)]
*  But according to the new Fox News poll, we know the economy is the overwhelming number [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=316.34s)]
*  one issue for voters, followed by immigration and abortion. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  And when asked who they trust on those top three jobs, well, Donald Trump comes out on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  top on two out of the three. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  Border security up 19 points. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=332.14s)]
*  Immigration at large up 14 points. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=335.66s)]
*  And then if you go down to the economy, most important one to voters, 38 percent of voters [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=338.1s)]
*  put that at number one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=342.42s)]
*  Donald Trump up six points. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=343.62s)]
*  So if you look at that, Trump does better with border security, immigration, foreign [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=345.26000000000005s)]
*  policy, the economy, crime and guns, the top issues that everyone says they're most concerned [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=348.66s)]
*  with. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=353.90000000000003s)]
*  Then Kamala is trusted more with the Supreme Court uniting America, health care, abortion [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  and climate change. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure some of that polling when it comes to the Supreme Court is linked to what [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  happened with Roe v. Wade. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=365.06s)]
*  And a lot of the progressives are concerned about that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=366.5s)]
*  I'm wondering, because also when you look at the overall polling, it looks like Donald [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=370.46s)]
*  Trump is up by one point. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=375.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  But he's also up by, I think, five point eight points with the independent. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  That really shocked me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=383.62s)]
*  I've said from the very beginning, I'm not really buying the whole momentum. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  I think it's a tight race. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=389.7s)]
*  I'm not sure Kamala is in the lead as some people have projected it to be. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=391.74s)]
*  So when you go state by state and you look at the real clear averages, Donald Trump is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=396.65999999999997s)]
*  still leading with the state. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=401.82s)]
*  So let's see what happens, obviously. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=403.98s)]
*  But I'm not sure the no sit downs, the lack of interviews, the lack of press conferences, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  the same old canned speech at the rally is going to do the fix for voters. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=413.3s)]
*  Well, we have two more months left, a little more than two more months. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=418.74s)]
*  I think the real test is going to be after the debates. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=422.26s)]
*  We'll see what the polling looks like after they debate. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=425.14s)]
*  And and Tim Walz has said, I'll debate on October 1st against J.D. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=427.7s)]
*  Vance. J.D. said last night to Laura Ingraham, I've known about this for three hours. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=432.62s)]
*  I'm definitely going to debate. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=436.02s)]
*  We need to work out all the details. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=437.42s)]
*  I'm not sure if October 1st is going to work, but we'll figure it out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=439.3s)]
*  The hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RjES4vFIOY&t=448.62s)]
