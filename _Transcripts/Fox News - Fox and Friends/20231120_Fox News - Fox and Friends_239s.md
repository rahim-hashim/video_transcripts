**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0)
*  Turning now to the war in Israel, the IDF says it's taken out three Hamas company commanders [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=0.0s)]
*  in overnight strikes, air strikes, as it continues to strengthen its grip on Gaza City. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=6.0s)]
*  So Israeli troops finding a Hamas tunnel under the Shefa hospital as well. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=11.42s)]
*  Well that changes everything. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=18.16s)]
*  That's what IDF has said for a while. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=19.32s)]
*  Trey Yankst is live on the ground in southern Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=21.36s)]
*  And Trey, you know, a picture says a thousand words and the image of that military tunnel [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=24.4s)]
*  under the hospital says it all. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=30.36s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=34.4s)]
*  I do want to start with some good news for once amid this horrific story about Al-Shefa [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=37.2s)]
*  hospital. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=42.44s)]
*  Over the weekend we learned that 31 premature babies were evacuated from the facility to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=43.44s)]
*  a hospital in southern Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=48.7s)]
*  Well today those babies, some of them crossed into Egypt where they will receive more medical [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=50.68s)]
*  care. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=55.84s)]
*  This was done in coordination with the United Nations and the Palestinian Red Crescent and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=56.84s)]
*  is just one piece of good news. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=61.28s)]
*  As we continue to follow the developments on the ground, Israeli forces pushing deeper [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=63.62s)]
*  into Gaza City this weekend. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=67.66s)]
*  And yesterday they did release some new information about Shefa hospital and Hamas activities [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  We now know at least two foreign hostages were taken to the hospital on the morning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  of October 7th, according to CCTV video released by the IDF. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=79.84s)]
*  Those men, Thai and Nepalese workers that were flanked by Hamas gunmen, we are not showing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=84.64s)]
*  the video out of respect for the families, but the revelation raising new questions about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  what international organizations knew about the operations within the hospital. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=93.04s)]
*  Also overnight the Israeli military along with the Shin Bet Security Agency released [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  new video of the tunnel system they say is beneath the facility. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=102.18s)]
*  The initial tunnel shaft estimated to be around 30 feet deep with a staircase and it connects [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=105.84s)]
*  to a 160 foot tunnel that ends with a blast door. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis do expect to find more as they keep digging in this area. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=114.08s)]
*  As the IDF pushes deeper into and below Gaza, there are new regional concerns about Iran [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  and its proxies climbing into an unstable situation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=122.64s)]
*  On Sunday, Iran-backed Houthi rebels hijacked a cargo ship in the Red Sea. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  The British-owned ship, called the Galaxy Leader, had no Israeli citizens on board when [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=130.56s)]
*  it was traveling from Turkey to India and it was intercepted. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=134.92s)]
*  A lot of developments over the weekend and we do know the northern front remains active [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=142.32s)]
*  Over the weekend, dozens of rockets fired into northern Israel and we understand alarms [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  sounding once again this morning. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=148.44s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=150.16s)]
*  You know, Troy, a quick question. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=151.16s)]
*  I was flipping the channels on the other networks and we're talking about the Shefa Hospital [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=152.56s)]
*  the report, the reporter said there's still no evidence that there's terrorist activity [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  happening in the Shefa Hospital. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=165.6s)]
*  So as someone that's been on the ground, has looked at the evidence, are you seeing evidence [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=168.48s)]
*  of terrorist activity inside of the Shefa Hospital? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so last week, less than 24 hours after the Israelis raided the hospital, we joined [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=176.92s)]
*  them in the middle of the night to see the evidence they had to present and they showed [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  us weapons in an MRI room and also a number of maps and booklets they say are linked to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=186.84s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=192.12s)]
*  Now we have no way to independently verify when and where they found those weapons, but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=193.12s)]
*  they say they were inside the room when they entered and they've now uncovered this tunnel [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=197.68s)]
*  shaft which is a major indication and something the Israelis are touting as a victory on the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=201.76s)]
*  information war because over the past, and I can just see a Black Hawk helicopter flying [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  toward Gaza, these helicopters are often used to evacuate casualties. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=212.0s)]
*  But in terms of this hospital, the tunnel system is something the Israelis have said [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=216.4s)]
*  for weeks existed underneath the hospital and they are touting this as an information [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=220.44s)]
*  victory supporting the claims that they put forward that Hamas was using the hospital [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=224.9s)]
*  not just as an area to treat Palestinian patients, but also as an area to launch military activities [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  from. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=235.32s)]
*  Picture says a thousand words. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=236.32s)]
*  Alright, Trey, thank you very much. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwsAAKb9UE0&t=237.72s)]
