# This is what America has to look forward to if Kamala is president: GOP rep
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c)
*  Vice President Kamala Harrison [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=0.0s)]
*  veils her economic plan, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  packed with government handouts and regulations, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=3.04s)]
*  with an emphasis on price gouging. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=5.88s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=8.8s)]
*  A loaf of bread cost 50% more today [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=10.24s)]
*  than it did before the pandemic. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=13.64s)]
*  Ground beef is up almost 50%. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=16.32s)]
*  And I will work to pass the first ever federal ban [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=19.28s)]
*  on price gauging on food. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=23.68s)]
*  But Trump warns this looks a lot like communism. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=27.32s)]
*  It leads to food shortages, rationing hunger. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=31.32s)]
*  We call it the Maduro Plan, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=34.52s)]
*  like something straight out of Venezuela [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=35.8s)]
*  or the Soviet Union. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=38.24s)]
*  The Maduro Plan, I love it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=40.28s)]
*  Our next guest fled communist Cuba. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=41.92s)]
*  Trump surrogate and Florida Congressman Carlos Jimenez [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=44.28s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Congressman, you fled Cuba when you were seven years old. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=48.96s)]
*  Let our viewers know what Cuba was like [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  and what we might be looking forward to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=57.44s)]
*  if Kamala Harris is elected. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  Cuba before the communism was probably [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  the second most prosperous nation here [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=70.36s)]
*  Standard living was really, really high. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=72.24s)]
*  Now people are fleeing Cuba. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=74.16s)]
*  Millions of Cubans have left Cuba [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=76.36s)]
*  because they can't sustain themselves. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=77.84s)]
*  They have shortages of everything. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=80.84s)]
*  And it's all due to the central economy, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=83.72s)]
*  centralized economy of communism. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=85.92s)]
*  And so look, price controls, they don't work. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=88.84s)]
*  They have never worked. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=91.8s)]
*  They never will work. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=92.72s)]
*  But what Kamala Harris is proposing, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=94.16s)]
*  I guess she's running back home. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Her father is a Marxist economics professor at Stanford. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=99.2s)]
*  And so when she wants economic advice, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=104.36s)]
*  I guess she's gonna ask it from her father [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=106.84s)]
*  who happens to be a Marxist. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=108.56s)]
*  And so that's what America has to look forward to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=109.72s)]
*  if Kamala Harris becomes president of the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  I want you to look at some of the, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=115.76s)]
*  she mentioned the prices. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  These are the prices of how much things have gone up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=118.12s)]
*  She's blaming, she somehow brings up the pandemic [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  as if that had something, had everything to do with it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there was some supply chain problems, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=127.12s)]
*  but it was government spending, it's printing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=129.56s)]
*  That's why we have 50% up, 20% up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=132.52s)]
*  Why half of Americans say that they feel like they are broke [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=136.08s)]
*  and can't make the bill. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=140.24s)]
*  Congressman, that her coming out so early [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=142.04s)]
*  and so just saying, I'm gonna do price control, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=145.2s)]
*  something so obviously communist, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=150.36s)]
*  that's actually gonna be a good help for Donald Trump [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=152.36s)]
*  as he tries to present his ideas versus her ideas [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=156.68s)]
*  to Hispanics, which are such an important block [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=160.04s)]
*  in this upcoming election. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=163.84s)]
*  Absolutely, I agree. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=166.84s)]
*  I think we just got a glimpse [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=167.96s)]
*  of what the real Kamala Harris is all about. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=169.08s)]
*  So we got a peek into who she really is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  And so yeah, look, what she's trying to do [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  is she's trying to blame greedy corporations [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  for the high prices when in fact, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  it was the Harris Biden administration's economic policy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=184.52s)]
*  that has given us this almost record inflation [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=188.56s)]
*  and also skyrocketing interest rates. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=192.44s)]
*  And so, which makes everything much more expensive [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=195.12s)]
*  for the average American family. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=198.28s)]
*  And so she's trying to deflect and say, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=199.96s)]
*  no, it's the corporation's fault [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=201.68s)]
*  and now I'm gonna bring them in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=203.12s)]
*  and so we can have lower prices. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=204.24s)]
*  It never works, it never will work. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=205.88s)]
*  And so again, I'm not sure she's gonna allow us [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  another glimpse into what she really is all about. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna have to let the American people know [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=215.0s)]
*  that yeah, her father is a Marxist economics professor [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=217.08s)]
*  at Stanford. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=223.4s)]
*  She has had radical left wing views all her entire life. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  This whole thing that she's somehow now, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=230.16s)]
*  oh wait, I don't believe that anymore, don't believe it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=232.04s)]
*  It's true and if she becomes president, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=235.28s)]
*  this is the most radical left wing ticket [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=238.04s)]
*  ever put in front of the American people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=241.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was a political mistake for her [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  to put this out so early. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=247.0s)]
*  I think it's a gift to Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  and it's certainly a gift in winning over Hispanics [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  who have seen this many, many times before [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=253.4s)]
*  and it never ends well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=256.08s)]
*  Congressman Jimenez, thank you for sharing your story [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=257.68s)]
*  and for joining us this morning. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=260.0s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=262.4s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI0cEUDyy0c&t=263.28000000000003s)]
