# Trump sides with Elon Musk on H-1B visas following criticism: 'A great program'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM)
*  Well, yesterday you guys know we had quite a few discussions on the debate that's raging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=0.0s)]
*  online right now about H-1B visas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=5.16s)]
*  And Elon Musk, Vivek Rameswamy, coming out saying, hey, we need this, our country needs [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=8.88s)]
*  this, our companies need this, we need this to have this technological advantage over [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=13.6s)]
*  China and other countries. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=17.52s)]
*  And other people saying, I'm not so sure. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=19.92s)]
*  A lot of those H-1B visas are for coding and they're sort of the grunt work of the tech [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=22.56s)]
*  industry. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=31.52s)]
*  And there's a lot of Americans who would like those jobs and we should be working on training [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  them instead of replacing them with foreign workers who presumably will do it for cheaper. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=36.84s)]
*  So that's the debate that's raging. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=43.18s)]
*  And in the midst of that, someone has found a quote from Donald Trump where he says he [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  backs H-1B visas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=51.32s)]
*  Now that would be contradictory to what he has said in the past. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=53.08s)]
*  We'll have to get to the bottom of that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=57.2s)]
*  But here's what he said on this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=58.4s)]
*  He said, the New York Post reported on Saturday, he said, I've always liked the visas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=60.92s)]
*  I've always been in favor of the visas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=65.52s)]
*  That's why we have them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=67.56s)]
*  I have many H-1B visas on my properties. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=68.92s)]
*  I've been a believer in H-1B. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=71.56s)]
*  I've used it many times. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=73.92s)]
*  It's a great program. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=75.56s)]
*  This is, I think, as we talked about yesterday, such an important debate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=78.76s)]
*  It's happening entirely among Republicans and within Trump world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  And obviously, what he is talking about here is the fact that he's obviously defending [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  the program. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=93.68s)]
*  But what I also think is sort of interesting is that he put into place in his first term [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=95.2s)]
*  a lot of restrictions that protected the program, that reformed the program. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=101.88s)]
*  And of course, one of the first things Joe Biden did, including opening the border wide [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  open to let lots and lots of unskilled labor into the country that we have no control over, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=112.84s)]
*  also removed a lot of those reforms to the H-1B visa program so that it was open to widespread [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=118.64s)]
*  abuse. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=128.24s)]
*  And in fact, that's what Stephen Miller tweeted back in 2023 talking about the first Trump [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  term in his position on H-1B visas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=133.0s)]
*  He said, Biden axed Trump admin H-1B reforms, which eliminated its use for cheap labor, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=135.52s)]
*  raised wages to stop displacement, outlawed substitution, and replaced H-1B lotteries [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=141.28s)]
*  with high paying offers, which precluded substitutions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=146.68s)]
*  Regs were scrapped and now Big Tech is replacing Americans. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=151.88s)]
*  So Trump weighs in yesterday suggesting he supports H-1B visas. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=155.96s)]
*  Now in the past, he has looked for reforms to H-1B visas. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=159.72s)]
*  On the surface, this issue I don't think has as deep a divide on the right as one might [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=164.12s)]
*  initially perceive. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=170.64s)]
*  Meaning, I think a lot of people on the right, including obviously Donald Trump and then [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=171.64s)]
*  Elon Musk, support the idea of bringing in whatever percentage it may be, .01%, whatever [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=176.76s)]
*  the number is, of highly, highly skilled people from across the world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=182.0s)]
*  The idea of bring your best. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=185.88s)]
*  But the program can't be abused to box American workers out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=188.04s)]
*  That's been the perspective in the past of Donald Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=191.6s)]
*  And I suspect it will be the position of Donald Trump in the future. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=194.0s)]
*  But the debate got deeper and it got more contentious on the cultural level. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=198.2s)]
*  And for example, that's where I took some exception to what I thought the vague grandma [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=202.28s)]
*  Swami made a too sweeping indictment of American culture. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=205.48s)]
*  Elon, by the way, weighed in immediately after Trump. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=208.96s)]
*  Pretty soundly, by the way. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=212.0s)]
*  Pretty soundly. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=214.4s)]
*  Well, Elon, this is a quote from Tropic Thunder. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=215.4s)]
*  He's memeing, remember Tropic Thunder with Robert Downey Jr. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Can we actually read the entire quote? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if we can do it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=225.32s)]
*  Let's try. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=226.32s)]
*  Let's try. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=227.32s)]
*  Okay, where is it? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=228.32s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=229.32s)]
*  This is what Elon put on us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=230.32s)]
*  He said, the reason I'm in America, along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=231.32s)]
*  companies that made America strong is because of H1B. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=236.0s)]
*  Go ahead, Charlie. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=238.56s)]
*  You can quote Tropic Thunder. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=239.56s)]
*  You can take a big step back and have fun with yourself in the face. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=240.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=245.16s)]
*  So that's what he said. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=246.16s)]
*  He obviously feels very strongly about it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=247.16s)]
*  Listen, I want to get into the cultural stuff. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=248.96s)]
*  Before that, remember the context about a lot of people were upset about the H1B visas [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=251.24s)]
*  were that famous story of Disney. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=255.72s)]
*  Do you guys remember that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=258.2s)]
*  Where Disney was going to lay off these workers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=259.8s)]
*  These were some sort of software workers. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=262.26s)]
*  And then they said, listen, we're going to lay you off and you will not get your severance [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  unless you train the people that come in. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=271.18s)]
*  These were foreign workers on this type of visa. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=273.98s)]
*  And so that really upset a lot of Americans. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=278.02s)]
*  And I believe that was the context around the conversation about abuses. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=282.7s)]
*  And lots of people are weighing in on both sides of this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=288.14s)]
*  And I think that's why Charlie, Vivek and Elon very strongly on the side of getting [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=293.1s)]
*  more H1B visas saying that we won't be competitive. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=297.1s)]
*  The cultural side, I think is fascinating, Will and Charlie. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=300.66s)]
*  I guess Vivek saying he thinks that we need to, our culture has a problem with not prizing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=306.1s)]
*  enough, those who are valedictorians and academically succeeding versus those who are the prized [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=315.58s)]
*  from Queens and the quarterbacks, I guess. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  What I think they kind of wandered into and neither Vivek nor Elon Musk, I think, appreciate [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=325.97999999999996s)]
*  sort of the nuances and just how what a sore spot this is for a lot of Americans. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=332.58s)]
*  Because of course, it wasn't just Disney. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=337.5s)]
*  You could go through in every industry going back 30 years and find examples of where American [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=339.14s)]
*  workers were forced to train their replacements as they unbolt their machinery and send it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=347.7s)]
*  to China. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=353.62s)]
*  And one thing I have to say, though, that I think is interesting, I've known Steve Miller [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=355.78s)]
*  since back when he was on Capitol Hill working for Jeff Sessions. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=360.3s)]
*  And he's always been one of the smartest people and most devoted to reforming immigration. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=367.82s)]
*  And there are few people that I know who know more about this and care more about it, which [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=376.62s)]
*  of course is why Trump values him so much. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=381.3s)]
*  And if there's a guy that understands where that line is between valuing the best of the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=385.22s)]
*  best, the cream of the crop from other places and finding a way to use them in America versus [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=390.42s)]
*  just looking for cheap labor, because all of it is kind of geared towards looking for [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  cheaper labor. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=404.12s)]
*  And, you know, Charlie, nobody's against another importing another Elon Musk. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=405.12s)]
*  You know, we'll take more of those. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=410.16s)]
*  However, if there are Americans who can do the job, let's have that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8g73N5YhM&t=412.56s)]
