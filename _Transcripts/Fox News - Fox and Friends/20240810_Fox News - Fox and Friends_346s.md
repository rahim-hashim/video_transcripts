# Democrats went at other Democrats: Brian Kilmeade
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw)
*  When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=0.0s)]
*  I can't even say how old I am. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=5.76s)]
*  It's hard for me to get out of my mouth. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=7.34s)]
*  Although it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=9.44s)]
*  to do what I, the most important thing we can do, and that is we must, we must, we must [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=14.5s)]
*  defeat Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=19.84s)]
*  President Biden finally opening up about his decision, hmm, wasn't his decision, to drop [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  out of the 2024 race. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=27.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, a former adviser with his administration is blaming top Democrats and the media and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=29.68s)]
*  donors for turning their backs on her old boss. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=36.2s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=39.8s)]
*  If you go back and you look at the polls, what you will see is you didn't see much movement [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=40.8s)]
*  whatsoever coming out of the debate because it was a fairly, the structure of this campaign [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=45.04s)]
*  had been fairly static for a long time and the debate didn't change that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=51.32s)]
*  What did change it was 24 days of unremitting, negative, horrible attacks on Joe Biden. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=54.8s)]
*  Joining us now with more is Fox and Friends co-host and host of One Nation, Brian Kilmeade. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=62.4s)]
*  So great to have you on the show, Brian. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=67.08s)]
*  So what happened after the debate that was fascinating to me is that George Clooney, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  who's really tight with Barack Obama, wrote an op-ed saying, hey, maybe Joe Biden should [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=74.0s)]
*  step down. And I think that was a signal to the media that they now could be unleashed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=80.28s)]
*  they had permission to go after Joe Biden for the final takedown in a coordinated in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=84.96s)]
*  a coordinated takedown. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=91.48s)]
*  You know, Rachel, things have happened so quickly and everyone's focusing on the new [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=94.56s)]
*  opponent for President Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=97.84s)]
*  We have not looked back yet. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=99.28s)]
*  And I think it's fascinating to watch Democrats coming and Democrats, not Republicans and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=100.68s)]
*  Democrats going at each other. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=105.08s)]
*  And Anita Dunn, whose idea it was to go get that debate done in June because they were [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=106.6s)]
*  more concerned than they were letting on about how they were trailing Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=112.32s)]
*  They wanted to get back in control. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=116.16s)]
*  They realized, in my view, that those court cases were not doing nothing but making him [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  more popular, more sympathetic. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=122.36s)]
*  So they said, let's get this thing done in June. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=124.72s)]
*  She was asked, do you regret doing that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  Was that part of a conspiracy to expose Joe so he gets out quickly? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  And she basically said, there's no way. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=133.0s)]
*  Joe Biden has a history of stepping up in big moments. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=135.32s)]
*  And they said, like the State of the Union, the comeback was, yeah, that was on the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=138.64s)]
*  prompter, he says, but his ad libs were even stronger. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=142.0s)]
*  And then once this is so I thought this was so telling in the political interview, when [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=144.68s)]
*  asked, everyone says Joe Biden is still very angry at Pelosi, Obama and Schumer and Schumer [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=149.6s)]
*  to a lesser extent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=155.8s)]
*  You know what her answer is? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=157.0s)]
*  But he's a thousand percent all in for Kamala Harris, which means he is furious. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=158.52s)]
*  And what does that say about your character? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=164.04s)]
*  When you're down, I'm going to kick you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=165.68s)]
*  I'm going to stab you in the back, flip you over, stab you in the front. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=168.36s)]
*  And then I'm going to humiliate you, tell the donors to stay out and give you 24 hours [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=171.56s)]
*  to decide to quit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=176.04s)]
*  But you really had no choice. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=177.16s)]
*  And they say that Harris was not maneuvering behind the scenes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  I have not heard that she was. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=181.8s)]
*  But it amazes me personally that she could get this campaign going. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=183.4s)]
*  These stops organized everything done so quickly. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=187.4s)]
*  I think at some level, a story is going to be told about he she was getting all her [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=191.32s)]
*  ducks in a row to be able to launch like this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=195.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of intrigue and it's seeping out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=197.72s)]
*  It's been very interesting to watch. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=203.52s)]
*  Hexess, home state of Minnesota, as her running mate. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=209.36s)]
*  And they're trying to present him as, you know, the shop, you know, teacher at your [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=212.68s)]
*  local high school as the coach. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  But there's a lot more to this guy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  It just doesn't ring true. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=222.16s)]
*  So you have a new special on Fox Nation called Who is Tim Walz? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=224.0s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=228.56s)]
*  Well, I just wherever you go, Rachel, people, I'm amazed how well read and how much [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=229.68s)]
*  the average person who does other things for a living knows about what's going on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=234.56s)]
*  So quickly, I think this special really goes out of its way to give you a competency on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=238.88s)]
*  who he is, what he became from a so-called so-called moderate in the house to a real [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=243.56s)]
*  left wing governor. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=250.56s)]
*  I don't know if he's been fully vetted. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=252.44s)]
*  I'm not saying he's a bad guy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=254.84s)]
*  I'm saying he's a left wing guy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=256.36s)]
*  And what Peggy Noonan said yesterday, I thought was written so yesterday was so true. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=258.04s)]
*  What Kamala Harris is saying by picking Tim Walz is that I am going to win with the left [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=261.64s)]
*  alone. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=267.8s)]
*  I'm going to get the young people to vote for the first time, the left wingers who were [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=268.84s)]
*  sitting out the last time to vote this time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=272.32s)]
*  And if you're an anti-Trump, if you're an anti-Trump, you could come aboard. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=275.52s)]
*  I don't really care. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=279.44s)]
*  If you're a moderate, you can come aboard. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=280.68s)]
*  But the left wing, it would be all in for the left wing or nothing, which is scary because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=282.04s)]
*  if they win, how they will govern will really affect this country forever. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=286.88s)]
*  And I'll talk about that a little bit. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=292.8s)]
*  I'm going to talk about that a little bit tonight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=295.32s)]
*  I got Kayleigh McEnany on One Nation tonight at 9 o'clock. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=296.88s)]
*  I got Jon Taffer on The Real Economy tonight, Tulsi Gabbard, how she's on the dope fly [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=299.8s)]
*  list. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=304.84s)]
*  I wonder if that has anything to do with who she took down in the debate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=305.84s)]
*  Tyrus looks at bad media moments. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=308.68s)]
*  And the secret weapon of Donald Trump is Michaela Montgomery. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=311.2s)]
*  We've got to talk to her tonight. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=316.04s)]
*  So hopefully everyone will watch. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  What a great lineup. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning, Brian. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=320.84000000000003s)]

*  Actually, he's probably heading to the beach because he could have come in studio and he [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=326.6s)]
*  decided not to. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLf3uPoEQw&t=331.32000000000005s)]
