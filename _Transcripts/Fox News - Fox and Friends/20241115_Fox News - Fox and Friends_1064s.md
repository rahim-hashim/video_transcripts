# Hosts react to RFK Jr. nomination: ‘Cannot wait’ for his confirmation hearing
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw)
*  Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump revealing another cabinet member at an event last night [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=0.0s)]
*  that he hosted. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=4.84s)]
*  Had a chance to really see him reflect on the victory for the first time as Washington [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=5.84s)]
*  reacts to the official nomination, RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=9.6s)]
*  Bill Mollugin is live in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=15.16s)]
*  Hey Bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=17.92s)]
*  Hey Lawrence, good morning to you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=18.92s)]
*  I tell you what, these picks are coming in so fast, it's almost hard to keep up with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=21.64s)]
*  them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=25.6s)]
*  Seven of these announcements yesterday alone for his administration. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=26.6s)]
*  The latest one came last night right here in Florida when he made somewhat of an informal [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=30.44s)]
*  announcement about North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=37.92s)]
*  I won't tell you the name of his, the exact name, I think he's an incredible person. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=39.28s)]
*  Might be something like Burgum. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Burgum, he's from North Dakota. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=45.92s)]
*  He's going to be announced tomorrow for a very big position. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=47.84s)]
*  He's going to head the Department of Interior and he's going to be fantastic. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=50.28s)]
*  Burgum was not Trump's splashiest announcement of the day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=56.12s)]
*  That came earlier in the evening when he announced that he's going to nominate RFK Jr. to be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=59.16s)]
*  his Health and Human Services Secretary. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=63.8s)]
*  That's something he talked about last night at an event at Mar-a-Lago here in Palm Beach. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=66.24s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=70.94s)]
*  The news reports, people like you Bobby. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=71.94s)]
*  Don't get too popular Bobby. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=76.36s)]
*  We want you to come up with things and ideas and what you've been talking about for a long [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=78.08s)]
*  time and I think you're going to do some unbelievable things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=83.14s)]
*  Now Trump made a handful of other nominations yesterday as well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=88.78s)]
*  Some of those include former Congressman Doug Collins, who's been tapped to lead the Department [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=91.94s)]
*  of Veterans Affairs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=95.86s)]
*  He will head the VA. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=96.98s)]
*  He also announced he's nominating Todd Blanch to be his Deputy Attorney General. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=98.5s)]
*  We remember Blanch defended Trump during his New York hush money trial. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=103.38s)]
*  And incoming GOP Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he's going to look at every option [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=107.18s)]
*  to get Trump's nominations confirmed as fast as possible. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=110.96s)]
*  That includes potentially doing recess appointments if necessary. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  I think we have to have all the options on the table and these nominees deserve their [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  day in court. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  We are not going to allow the Democrats to thwart the will of the American people in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  giving President Trump the people that he wants in those positions to implement his [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=129.04s)]
*  agenda. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=133.24s)]
*  And guys, one thing about RFK Jr. at HHS. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=134.24s)]
*  HHS is not just a health agency that's going to handle vaccines and stuff like that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=139.88s)]
*  It is also related to the border. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=144.44s)]
*  HHS is the agency responsible for caring for unaccompanied migrant children who show up [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=146.76s)]
*  at the border. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=151.92s)]
*  Border Patrol transfers them to HHS. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=152.92s)]
*  They have to care for them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=154.76s)]
*  Then they have to find and vet adult sponsors for them across the country. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=156.12s)]
*  So if something goes wrong there with migrant children during the Trump administration, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=160.4s)]
*  that could be politically perilous. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=163.88s)]
*  We all know the media is going to be very hawkish trying to find anything they can [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=165.64s)]
*  do when it comes to those migrant children with the Trump administration. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  Hey Bill, did you ever get good answers from the current administration about the missing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  children? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=178.2s)]
*  I mean, do they try to rationalize that down? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=179.2s)]
*  They say that numbers inflated. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=181.76s)]
*  Have you ever gotten a good answer for that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=183.48s)]
*  The administration's position has been they haven't lost these children. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  They say they just haven't done the right paperwork on them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=191.54s)]
*  So there's different reporting that has come out. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=194.72s)]
*  But there was a pretty damning inspector general report from the DHS inspector general that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=196.56s)]
*  said they failed to file paperwork with tens of thousands of these children. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=200.88s)]
*  We all remember that New York Times report where they were finding these children working [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=205.24s)]
*  in slaughterhouses and construction sites all across the country in violation of labor [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=208.46s)]
*  laws and some of these kids were killed or seriously maimed working in these jobs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=212.7s)]
*  So it's been a big issue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=216.4s)]
*  Yeah, they should be in school and they maybe shouldn't be here at all. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=217.64s)]
*  Bill Mollujian, thanks so much. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you Bill. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=223.04s)]
*  I think that's an answer though when you lose children to say, oh no, it was just a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=224.04s)]
*  paperwork. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=227.16s)]
*  2024, we cannot find 110,672. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=228.16s)]
*  It's been over a hundred thousand every year. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=232.84s)]
*  And I'm sure there's some missing during the Trump years, but they get this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=235.72s)]
*  They got to make this a priority. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=239.04s)]
*  Well, remember the whistleblower down, I think it was in Texas and she was working at one [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=240.32s)]
*  of the one of the Catholic charities or something where they take in the children and individuals [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  around the country could could call these shelters and say, I need two boys or I need [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=249.22s)]
*  whatever. And she was the whistleblower that said this guy had a ranch or a farm and he [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  needed these two boys and they would pick them up. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=258.36s)]
*  Yeah. And then they went to find out where the boys were and they had been on like helping [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=260.88s)]
*  and lived in like a shed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=266.08s)]
*  Yeah, didn't work. Exactly. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=268.0s)]
*  So you talk about a disruptor. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  Here we go. R.F.K. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=272.88s)]
*  Jr. cave CNN, something to talk about. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=274.2s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone's watching, but he was named HHS secretary. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=277.08s)]
*  They've been talking about different positions, maybe a czar position. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=280.8s)]
*  But he has spent a lot of his time in environmental causes, maybe the last 10 years, focusing [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=283.8s)]
*  on what's in our food, what's in our vaccines, what is what is in our medicine. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  He talks a lot about it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=293.8s)]
*  Kaylee and Callie Means wrote a book about it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=295.12s)]
*  Dr. McCarrie followed up with it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  They're all on the same page on the Frankenstein foods were all digesting and how it relates. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  But now R.F.K. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Jr. will have a chance to put together his programs and start dismantling some of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  corruption. He says it exists in that look at a hemoth organization. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=310.44s)]
*  Look at his resume. Very impressive. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=313.56s)]
*  He founded the Waterkeeper Alliance, which is the world's largest clean water advocacy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=315.16s)]
*  group. He founded Children's Health Defense to address childhood chronic disease. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  Don't they say he says six in 10 people have chronic disease here in America now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=323.84s)]
*  Name Time magazine's hero for the planet. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=328.52s)]
*  That was when he was probably a Democrat or didn't support Trump when they liked him. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=331.12s)]
*  He attended Harvard, London School of Economics, the University of Virginia Law School, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=335.52s)]
*  Pace University School of Law as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=339.16s)]
*  And then in 2008, Obama considered him as the head of the EPA. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=341.48s)]
*  And there was a glowing article about it in Politico. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=346.32s)]
*  Obama considers stars for cabinet, strongly considering R.F.K. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=348.6s)]
*  Jr. to head the EPA. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=352.52000000000004s)]
*  So this guy really has an agenda and it's been endorsed by the president elect. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  He says he wants to combat the chronic disease epidemic, eliminate toxins from foods, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=358.12s)]
*  water and air, air support, sustain your sustainable. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=363.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, farming and reducing chemical use, preserve and restore natural ecosystems [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=369.32s)]
*  and ensure regulatory agencies act. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=376.08s)]
*  Who's not for that? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  The big thing, Ainsley, I think is the food. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=380.52s)]
*  I agree. It's like I don't know why this has become. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=383.0s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe because R.F.K. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=387.2s)]
*  now has become a partisan issue. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  But getting our kids quality food and us as well. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=390.96s)]
*  And why do other countries have quality food and we don't? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  I think is a major issue. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=397.64s)]
*  They talk about how, OK, he has ideas, but can he run an agency? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  He has, you know, he's smart. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=403.24s)]
*  But has he ever done anything like this before? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=405.0s)]
*  Does he really know what he's getting into? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  He's overseeing 13 agencies. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  He's going to be overseeing the FDA, CDC, Medicare, Medicaid and Affordable Care Act, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=409.56s)]
*  which is on a respirator, are responsible for caring for unaccompanied migrant borders. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=414.76s)]
*  He's got a huge budget. But here's the thing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=420.0s)]
*  When I cannot wait for his nomination hearing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=422.0s)]
*  because they're going to press him to back up his beliefs. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=424.64s)]
*  And he's going to welcome this conversation. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=428.28s)]
*  He likes having these debates. He spent his entire career. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=430.32s)]
*  We used to do it like this. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=433.04s)]
*  We used to debate things rather than dig in and try to vilify the other side. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=434.16s)]
*  I also thought it was interesting that Jared Polis, I thought this was being trolled. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=437.52s)]
*  The governor of Colorado says, said this about his nomination. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=441.08s)]
*  If as a country we follow the science, we would be also be far more concerned [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=446.12s)]
*  about the impact of pesticides and public health and A.G. policy, as well as nutrition. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=449.48s)]
*  Oh, lack of access. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=454.6s)]
*  And he goes on to say that he's very encouraged about RFK getting this nomination. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=456.2s)]
*  So obviously he's not going to have a vote. It's going to be in the Senate. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=460.8s)]
*  But the governor of Colorado shows an openness. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=463.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't you show an openness? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=465.84s)]
*  And I just think if there wasn't a pandemic where all of us were forced to take a vaccine [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=467.4s)]
*  or be fired or in some cases or you got it and you have these [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=471.76s)]
*  these ramifications and you see that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=475.8s)]
*  Anthony Fauci could not defend a lot of his actions. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=479.6s)]
*  And people started looking to the agencies. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=482.24s)]
*  RFK doesn't become the rock star he became. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=484.16s)]
*  And he doesn't have an opportunity to do this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=486.68s)]
*  I don't think the American people would have been open to it without the pandemic. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=488.72s)]
*  Yeah. When he was on the curvy couch with us, we were asking him about [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  what's in our foods that that's so bad. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=495.24s)]
*  And he said, let's take McDonald's, for instance. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  He said in other countries, they use three ingredients [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=499.56s)]
*  and to make your McDonald's french fries here, we use the wrong ingredients. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=502.56s)]
*  We used to use a certain type of oil when we cooked. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=507.24s)]
*  He said, but didn't he say we're going to go back to something else? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=510.56s)]
*  I think he said he's not for the seed oil, right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=513.72s)]
*  I can't remember. But he said, whatever we're doing now is so bad for our children. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=515.64s)]
*  He wants to go back to that. He said. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=519.48s)]
*  I also talked about Froot Loops. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=521.08s)]
*  He said all the dyes to make all of the Froot Loops different colors. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=522.36s)]
*  It's so bad for you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=526.6s)]
*  And other countries don't even allow it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  So he says that they use fruit dyes for in other countries. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=529.48s)]
*  So it's more natural. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  And we use different dyes with all different types of ingredients as well. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  He talked to Rachel a little while ago. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=539.36s)]
*  And this is what he had to say. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=541.88s)]
*  In Europe, the same companies are producing the same products, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=544.72s)]
*  but they're using natural coloring. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=549.76s)]
*  But here they can get away with it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  We have about almost a thousand chemicals that are in our food [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=554.52s)]
*  that are either outright banned in Europe or actively discouraged. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=560.08s)]
*  So you wouldn't be able to buy this kind of stuff in Europe. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=563.52s)]
*  You ask about why it's so cheap. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=566.12s)]
*  Why it's so ubiquitous? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=568.28s)]
*  It's because we subsidize the worst foods. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=572.56s)]
*  We subsidize it with about 70 percent of our food stamp program [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=575.28s)]
*  is to process foods, which are all poisoned. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=579.2399999999999s)]
*  So, you know, it's just so how we got in politics. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=582.1199999999999s)]
*  He was talking about the food stamps and that people were outraged. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  They say, you know, we shouldn't be using food stamps for Coke and Pepsi [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=588.1199999999999s)]
*  because it's terrible for you and it's not good for you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=590.4799999999999s)]
*  And they said, how dare you? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=592.8s)]
*  We should make our own choices when it comes to food stamps, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=593.9599999999999s)]
*  just because we're on tough economic times and means I can't have soda. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  What he's just trying to say is if we're giving you food stamps [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=600.2800000000001s)]
*  to buy stuff that's bad for you, we're not helping you. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=603.1600000000001s)]
*  And how many people do we see in economically depressed areas [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=606.24s)]
*  who are clearly overweight? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=609.5200000000001s)]
*  And you wonder, you know, it's not because of excess. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=611.08s)]
*  Maybe it's because the food they're eating is cheaper, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=613.32s)]
*  but it also terrible for you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=616.1600000000001s)]
*  So this is going to ripple right down to the farms. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  And then what we're paying them to do and what we're subsidizing not to do. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  So this is going to be so disruptive. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=624.5200000000001s)]
*  And the question is, can he push back against big pharma? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  Can he push back against the food industry, the FDA and get his point across? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=631.24s)]
*  We have enough allies in the bureaucracy to get this done, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  or is he going to be frustrated in eight months and say, I got to back out? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=639.52s)]
*  Yeah, because a lot of these farmers want these chemicals [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=642.52s)]
*  because it preserves their food, it makes it last longer. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=644.76s)]
*  So it sits on the shelf. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  They're able to sell it for longer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's he's saying it's very harmful, all these chemicals for our bodies. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  You do wonder why we're seeing so many people in their 20s with stage four cancer [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=655.48s)]
*  or why the obesity problem is such a big problem in our country. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=660.2s)]
*  Is it because we're eating too much or is it because what's in our food is making us bigger? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=664.36s)]
*  It's become a huge epidemic. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  We go to we go to Italy and you can eat pizza and pasta and you don't get any weight. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=670.48s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=675.44s)]
*  Three quarters of the country is obese or overweight right now. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=676.2s)]
*  So and by the way, it's tallow fat. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=679.0s)]
*  Tallow fat is what they used to cook the French fries. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=680.6s)]
*  Thank you. Our wonderful producers in the back. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=682.6s)]
*  So the president late made another appointment. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=684.28s)]
*  He was supposed to announce it today. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=686.28s)]
*  He said it's going to be more formal. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  But he also named someone that was on the shortlist to be Vice President [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=689.36s)]
*  Doug Burgum to be head of the Interior Department. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=694.4s)]
*  Listen, I know he's lower profile than the others, but he will make a huge impact. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=697.48s)]
*  You do not know how smart he is. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=701.44s)]
*  This is like a NFL player going help you helping youth sports and saying, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=703.76s)]
*  I'm going to teach you how to play football because this guy knows everything about finance, tech. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=708.52s)]
*  The the the open tundra, he grew up on a ranch. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=713.52s)]
*  He will be fantastic at working in conjunction with oil and gas responsibly. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=716.76s)]
*  And he's got international connections. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=721.04s)]
*  You're going to see this guy make a huge impact. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=723.0799999999999s)]
*  But I loved last night because I watched the whole repeat. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=725.48s)]
*  It's the first time I think the president reflected publicly on his victory. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=728.4s)]
*  I've never seen him so content, so happy in front of an adoring crowd [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=733.24s)]
*  and a certain celebrity. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=737.9599999999999s)]
*  It was the America First Policy Institute Gala. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=739.3199999999999s)]
*  It was at Mar-a-Lago and Sylvester Stallone [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=742.48s)]
*  spoke about the president and compared him to his rocky character. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=746.88s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=751.6s)]
*  We are in the presence of a really mythical character. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=753.88s)]
*  I love mythology and this individual does not exist on this planet. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=757.88s)]
*  Nobody in the world could have pulled off what he pulled off. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=763.16s)]
*  So I'm in awe. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=765.88s)]
*  And I'll just say this and I mean it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=768.24s)]
*  When George Washington defended his country, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=771.96s)]
*  he had no idea that he was going to change the world. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=775.6s)]
*  Because without him, you can imagine what the world would look like. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=779.88s)]
*  Guess what? We got the second George Washington. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=783.52s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=786.16s)]
*  Please welcome the president of the United States, Donald Trump. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=789.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=795.16s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=796.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=797.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. Wow. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you, Sly. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=805.88s)]
*  You know, Sly does not do that. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=807.12s)]
*  He doesn't do that stuff. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  And he did a beautiful job. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to turn our country around. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=812.48s)]
*  We're going to make it so great, so strong, so powerful. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=814.04s)]
*  We're going to bring it all back. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=818.36s)]
*  I want to thank some people that have been so instrumental [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=820.76s)]
*  in doing such a great job. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=824.4s)]
*  We have a man who has a seriously high IQ. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=826.28s)]
*  You know, I'm a person that believes in high IQs, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=829.6s)]
*  and his is about as high as they get. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=831.92s)]
*  He launched a rocket three weeks ago, and then he went to Pennsylvania [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=834.56s)]
*  to campaign because he considered this more important than launching rockets [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=838.72s)]
*  that cost billions of dollars. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=842.24s)]
*  Elon Musk, another one who's another great mind and a great guy and so popular. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=843.72s)]
*  And I think he's right. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=848.76s)]
*  He wants to make people healthy. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=850.52s)]
*  It's driven him pretty wild over the last number of years. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=851.92s)]
*  Today, I nominated him for, I guess, if you like health [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=855.92s)]
*  and if you like people that live a long time, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=859.68s)]
*  it's the most important position, RFK Jr., Bobby. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=861.5999999999999s)]
*  And a woman who was a Democrat and was independent, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=866.36s)]
*  she went independent, and last week she said, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=871.52s)]
*  I want to be a Republican because this is what I stand for. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=874.0s)]
*  And I've always admired her, and I've admired her [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=877.24s)]
*  because she was loaded up with common sense. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=879.96s)]
*  And it's all about common sense. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=882.84s)]
*  I mean, we're conservative in this room, but we can understand the other side. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=884.96s)]
*  But what we really are is people with common sense. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=889.24s)]
*  And I think that's why we won with the numbers that we won by. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=892.84s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=896.64s)]
*  He's having a lot of fun. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=898.4000000000001s)]
*  Loaded up with common sense. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=900.12s)]
*  I will say the president looks rested as well. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=901.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  He looks like he is in the zone right now picking his cabinet members. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=905.4000000000001s)]
*  It's good seeing him like this right now. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=909.52s)]
*  Yeah, I saw Congressman Torres in New York say, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=911.0799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has begun to crack the ultimate blue wall. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=915.16s)]
*  He lost New Jersey by seven. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=918.88s)]
*  He lost New York by 10. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=920.88s)]
*  And if we don't wake up, it's going to be just only the beginning. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=922.52s)]
*  And that's what you're seeing. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=926.12s)]
*  Remember, the thing that struck me about Hulk Hogan, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=927.64s)]
*  he came out and said, you know, I've always been a supporter, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=929.52s)]
*  but I never spoke up. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=931.04s)]
*  Now he spoke up. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=931.88s)]
*  And then you see Stallone. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=932.92s)]
*  I always knew he was a supporter, but now he speaks up. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=933.88s)]
*  And then I see MSG. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=936.36s)]
*  I'm watching New York City, people walking around. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=937.48s)]
*  You mentioned with their red hats. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=939.36s)]
*  So we always knew the president had fervent supporters, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=941.28s)]
*  but not in all across the country. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=944.4s)]
*  In fact, they were so-called a trigger. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  There's something becoming very mainstream, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  or either his enemies are giving him an honest look for the first time [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=951.36s)]
*  that is happening before our eyes. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=956.16s)]
*  There used to be the silent Trump voter. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=958.16s)]
*  They are out now. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=961.04s)]
*  They're out. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=962.24s)]
*  And I don't mean out there just yapping away, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=963.12s)]
*  but just putting on their t-shirt. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=966.28s)]
*  That didn't happen before. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=968.96s)]
*  I actually saw someone in New York City. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=969.8000000000001s)]
*  That's so rare to see someone in New York City with a MAGA hat on. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=971.36s)]
*  I think they're definitely doing that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=975.2s)]
*  They're definitely doing that in South Carolina. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=976.9200000000001s)]
*  There was a concert at Clemson, and everyone, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=980.12s)]
*  Lee Bryce was playing at Clemson, and a friend went and said, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  everyone in the crowd was wearing those. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  All the students were wearing them. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=988.2s)]
*  They were all chanting. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=989.88s)]
*  I think it was right after he had won. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=991.0s)]
*  And so you are seeing that a lot. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=993.2s)]
*  But here, you don't necessarily, I think [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=995.52s)]
*  the factors are different in New York. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=997.84s)]
*  The reason that I think he lost only by 10 points in New York [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=999.16s)]
*  is because there was that silent Jewish vote. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  Here, I have a group that I talked to that are Jewish, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1006.12s)]
*  have never voted for a Republican, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1009.96s)]
*  and they decided to this election. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1011.76s)]
*  And they love Donald Trump because of what he does for Israel. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1013.32s)]
*  I think also here, the crime issue, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1016.08s)]
*  the illegal immigration issue was a big deal here. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  So I don't know if they're voting necessarily for the Republican Party. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1021.32s)]
*  And if that will continue, maybe it will. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1024.04s)]
*  If the Democratic Party doesn't get their act together, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1026.12s)]
*  they continue to go more and more progressive. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1028.9199999999998s)]
*  But I think they voted for Trump because, A, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1031.04s)]
*  they know four years ago he was in office. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1033.3999999999999s)]
*  They saw what he did. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1035.84s)]
*  And they know that what the liberal media was trying to say was a lie. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1037.1599999999999s)]
*  He wasn't going to ban, people knew he wasn't going to ban abortion. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1041.48s)]
*  They try to say that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1045.6399999999999s)]
*  He says it's going back to the states. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1046.96s)]
*  They knew a lot of other things that he was going to do, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1048.8s)]
*  and it was going to be positive for them. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1051.12s)]
*  And the economy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1052.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1053.96s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIXzFy5dWw&t=1054.84s)]
