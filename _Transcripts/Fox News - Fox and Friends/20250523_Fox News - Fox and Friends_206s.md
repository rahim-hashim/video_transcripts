# BREAKING: Trump announces major Russia-Ukraine prisoner swap
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY)
*  Now, I want to get you on this as well, another major news story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to talk about what's going on in Ukraine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=3.0s)]
*  This from President Trump on Truth Social. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=6.12s)]
*  He says this, a major prisoner swap was just completed between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=7.92s)]
*  It will go into effect shortly. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=12.96s)]
*  Congratulations to both sides on this negotiation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=14.48s)]
*  This could lead to something big. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=18.04s)]
*  So my question is to you, what could this lead to and how does this war end? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=20.36s)]
*  Well, first of all, we've been doing prison swaps for two years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=27.12s)]
*  And this is a step, a positive step certainly when negotiations go on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=31.12s)]
*  Let's hope it does lead to something. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Right now, the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, is waiting for Russia to return a term sheet as a result of the last negotiations that took place. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  And we will see if they're willing to make any concessions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  To date, they have not. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And that's where we are. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=55.12s)]
*  What is really going on here? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=57.12s)]
*  What Putin is attempting to do and he has never changed his aspirations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=59.12s)]
*  He wants to topple the government in Ukraine, take control of Ukraine, and then also move into Eastern Europe and return these countries to the Russian Empire. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=64.12s)]
*  Some people in our country roll their eyes at that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=74.12s)]
*  The facts speak for themselves. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=77.12s)]
*  We have public intelligence reports that validate what I just said. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=80.12s)]
*  That is his intent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=86.12s)]
*  The strategy in negotiations is to delay as much as possible. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=88.12s)]
*  He talks to the president about he's interested in peace just like the president. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=92.12s)]
*  He wants to normalize relations just like the president. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=96.12s)]
*  So there's economic benefit for both. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=99.12s)]
*  But what actually happens? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=101.12s)]
*  No concessions whatsoever. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=103.12s)]
*  No movement towards a ceasefire, a temporary ceasefire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=106.12s)]
*  Why doesn't he go to the ceasefire? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=111.12s)]
*  Because I think he believes he loses all the leverage. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=113.12s)]
*  The killing stops. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=116.12s)]
*  And he knows full well the president wants to stop the killing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=117.12s)]
*  If you have the ceasefire, no killing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=121.12s)]
*  He loses leverage. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=124.12s)]
*  He wants maximum concessions. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=125.12s)]
*  And if he doesn't get the maximum concessions, he wants to drag this out so that the president gets so frustrated that he leaves in the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=127.12s)]
*  And that's what we're talking about in negotiations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=136.12s)]
*  And what Putin wants is the president no longer to support Ukraine with intelligence and with weapons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=139.12s)]
*  Think of where the Russians are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=145.12s)]
*  They've tried to topple this country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=147.12s)]
*  They're 39 months into this war, Lisa. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=149.12s)]
*  And they still haven't moved the lines all that much from where they began in 22. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=152.12s)]
*  If you look at an Institute for the Study of War map, where we were in 22 and where we are now, 39 months later, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=156.12s)]
*  they've taken casualties now up to 50,000, close to 50,000 a month. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=164.12s)]
*  Last year, it was close to 40,000. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=169.12s)]
*  So the progress in the war is completely overstated by Russia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=171.12s)]
*  They are having major problems themselves with this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=176.12s)]
*  And they certainly want the United States to stop supporting them, supporting Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=180.12s)]
*  That's where he's coming from. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=185.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=186.12s)]
*  General Jack Kehan, it's always an honor to see you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=187.12s)]
*  We appreciate your time this morning. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=189.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=191.12s)]
*  Yeah, great talking to you, Lisa. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=192.12s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=193.12s)]
*  Great talking to you as well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NUd5ZJVobY&t=194.12s)]
