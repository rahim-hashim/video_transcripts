*  Sign up for Fox Nation for $1.99 a month. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=35.1s)]
*  Faith-based content growing more popular with more and more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=39.2s)]
*  adults saying they've become more spiritual even as they are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=42.9s)]
*  less religious. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=46.6s)]
*  Father Mike Schmitz is the young adult ministry director for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Duluth for the Duluth Minnesota Diocese and he joins us now [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=51.3s)]
*  Father. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=54.8s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=55.2s)]
*  This is absolutely you know what? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=56.6s)]
*  Rachel and I were hanging out earlier this week talking and I [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=59.1s)]
*  was saying, you know, Hollywood is so good at producing sequels [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  and superhero movies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=65.8s)]
*  The Bible in Christianity represents some of the oldest [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=68.8s)]
*  stories in humanity obviously successful as people keep [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=71.3s)]
*  returning to it, but it hasn't been mined for high production [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=73.8s)]
*  like we're seeing here with the Saints. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=77.1s)]
*  I would think of entrepreneur interested in making money even [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=78.9s)]
*  would look at this and go hey, maybe we should source this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=82.2s)]
*  material. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=84.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=85.5s)]
*  I mean, it's one of those situations where when people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=86.4s)]
*  start actually reading the Bible, they're like, oh my gosh, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=88.4s)]
*  there is more violence here than I thought there is more disaster [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=91.0s)]
*  than I thought there's more drama than I thought there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=95.8s)]
*  There's more things than I thought and I think that if [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  there was anyone again, even with an entrepreneurial mind, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=100.7s)]
*  you think this is an incredible you can't say original story, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  but it's an incredible story and that's a kind of one of those [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=106.9s)]
*  situations that like why not? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=109.7s)]
*  Why not tap into that? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and the Saints, I mean the lives of the Saints. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=113.0s)]
*  I mean you and I are both Catholic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=115.6s)]
*  It's such a big part of our religion and our tradition, but [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=117.3s)]
*  all Christians can take, you know, something from these [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=122.0s)]
*  stories because there's so much bravery and there's so there's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=125.6s)]
*  so much humanity in it and these stories. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=128.7s)]
*  I love the production value given to these stories. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=130.8s)]
*  What I'm fascinated with father is that we're seeing people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=134.3s)]
*  drawn to spirituality drawn to religious stories and we're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=138.4s)]
*  drawn to religious stories yet. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=142.2s)]
*  They say they're less religious. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  Can you help us break down what that means? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think one of the main issues there is is there's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  something in the human heart that longs for more there's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  something in all of us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=157.0s)]
*  We realize this isn't everything that there is that there's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=158.1s)]
*  there's more than just this that that were made for more and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=161.0s)]
*  yet at the same time, I think that there's also something in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=165.7s)]
*  us that rejects the high call. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=168.0s)]
*  I mean if we go back to Christianity go back to Catholicism [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=171.1s)]
*  here's Jesus who says if you want to be my disciple deny [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  yourself pick up your cross and follow after me and there's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  something about that that that that's inspiring and it's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=179.0s)]
*  attractive. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=182.1s)]
*  It's beautiful, but it's also intimidating and I think that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=183.0s)]
*  sometimes that notion of being spiritual that religious gives [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=186.1s)]
*  me the ability to like live out that that thing of me that I [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=189.1s)]
*  know I'm made for more but I'm also kind of maybe and I'm [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=192.4s)]
*  also kind of maybe avoiding the the challenging part the part [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=196.1s)]
*  that says that I have to do what I don't want to do sometimes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  well, we have just a little bit of time here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=202.7s)]
*  I've got a 15 year old son and he's he found his church joined [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=204.6s)]
*  his church. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  He's become a leader of Fellowship of Christian Athletes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  all on his own. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  I have not been going to church with him until he invited me [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=213.0s)]
*  and now he got me back into church is basically what I'm [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=216.1s)]
*  saying. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=218.5s)]
*  He's 15 years old, but that seems to be a trend statistically [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  Gen X and Millennials moved away but Gen Z and whatever the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=222.1s)]
*  Gen Alpha I guess are moving towards is it because of the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=226.7s)]
*  influence of social media you spend time with youth. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=230.1s)]
*  What do you think it is about this generation that's bringing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=232.2s)]
*  them back towards if not religion spirituality and faith? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think that there can be social media. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  I think that is can be a great tool, but I think another thing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  is social media in the sense that we're more divided in than [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  ever. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=248.7s)]
*  We're more hungry for relationships than ever and then all [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=249.0s)]
*  of a sudden you have this community that says anything not [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=252.1s)]
*  in a manipulative way, but in a way that says like actually [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=254.9s)]
*  you're worth paying attention to you're worth seeing you're [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=257.8s)]
*  worth knowing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=259.8s)]
*  I want to hear from you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=261.1s)]
*  We want to actually be in relationship and so that it's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=262.0s)]
*  not the end but at least is the start and I think one of the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=265.5s)]
*  reasons why we see this trend is because there's a lot of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=267.7s)]
*  loneliness out there and again, you can be the belly that or [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=271.6s)]
*  you can say like no actually there's a there's a name for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=274.5s)]
*  your loneliness and his name is Jesus. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=277.1s)]
*  Love Father Schmitz. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQG8X4k4Yk&t=279.5s)]
