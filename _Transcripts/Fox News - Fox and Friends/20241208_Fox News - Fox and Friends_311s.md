*  Jesus of Nazareth [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  in this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Slightly different telling of the story. We've gone for the political backdrop [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=60.68s)]
*  We've given it a bit more beef in the I want to say the other [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=65.28s)]
*  Characters to create this political backdrop to show you the world in which Jesus is up against and I have to say it's a very [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=69.66s)]
*  very digestible [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=77.88s)]
*  And [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=80.83999999999999s)]
*  entertaining piece of television that allows you to connect with this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=81.8s)]
*  Incredible story. We've all worked very very hard on it. I do believe it is one of the best incarnations [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=86.0s)]
*  of this type where we've merged drama and documentary together to help us understand some of the nuances of this story and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=93.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're very proud of it and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  We can't wait for you to see how it unfolds and how it really starts to take flight as we get into the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  4-5 episodes of the story. Well, Terrick it is the greatest story ever told. Well, that will never change [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm really impressed. We talk a lot about these Christian stories [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  And there are some that have really great production value and some that don't I'm looking at this. This looks like high production value [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=121.2s)]
*  I understand that you also filmed this in Morocco. Is that correct? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=128.0s)]
*  well, I [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=132.0s)]
*  Pleased to tell you that I'm actually here in Morocco now where we're shooting season 2 and 3 [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=134.04s)]
*  So the delights of crazy Marrakesh wonderful place that we've been privileged to shoot in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=140.24s)]
*  Yes, you're absolutely right Rachel. It's it's a high production value [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=146.0s)]
*  Utopia the production company working with Fox to create this piece. We've really [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=150.2s)]
*  really worked hard on the cinematography to find the creative ways to transport the viewer into this world and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=155.8s)]
*  You know some people are saying that it has these qualities of the likes of Game of Thrones House of Dragon [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=163.72s)]
*  you know, we the costumes the makeup the the cinematography is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=170.72s)]
*  is second to none and the most important thing is is the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=176.24s)]
*  Calibre of the script to enable us to tell it and of course we as actors we have the privilege of you know, trying to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Try to imagine this world [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=189.96s)]
*  Hmm, I can't wait to see it Tarek [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=192.28s)]
*  but it's also kind of interesting, you know to to remember that obviously Jesus was a real man and he was in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=194.52s)]
*  Very political times and especially when you see what has happened overnight in Syria [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=201.56s)]
*  It's a it's kind of a shocking reminder that that these events are still unfolding today [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=206.84s)]
*  You're absolutely right. It's it's so relevant to today and absolutely right [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=214.4s)]
*  What's happened overnight, it's really really quite worrying and one could argue that this is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  You know coming at a perfect time to sort of connect this story [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and just to touch on what you said there about the fact that Jesus [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=231.52s)]
*  You know this human element and I remember I have played Jesus before actually 20 years ago [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  I was a younger Jesus then and one of the challenges was trying to understand. How can you play as an actor? How can you? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=240.96s)]
*  Embody the divine and the human at the same time. It's almost I want to say I want to say impossible actually [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  But tapping into some of these human struggles that you can resonate with [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=257.76s)]
*  Allows you to bring the truth to it and I actually think that that draws [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  People in just as Jesus would have done in in that day. Well, we can't wait to pull it off [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=270.12s)]
*  We can't wait to watch you pull it off. Yeah [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=275.0s)]
*  No [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=276.96s)]
*  We're really looking forward to this and and it's again perfect timing to drop it off [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=277.28s)]
*  Not just the political angle that Charlie brought about but we're in the Christmas season [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=281.84s)]
*  So I can't I can't imagine a better time to catch it [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=284.76s)]
*  Thanks for bringing more about that to us and we look forward to watching it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzmgUWamjo&t=287.71999999999997s)]
