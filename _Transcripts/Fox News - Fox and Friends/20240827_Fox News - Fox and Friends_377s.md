# Peter Doocy: They STILL won't admit what we all know
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY)
*  Fox News where the White House responds to Mark Zuckerberg's letter in which the meta CEO says the platform censored COVID content [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=0.0s)]
*  after cave into pressure from the Biden Harris administration [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=7.44s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us live from the White House. Hey Peter [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=11.44s)]
*  Good morning [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And the reason that we know about this letter that Mark Zuckerberg sent to Jim Jordan is because Jim Jordan posted it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=16.04s)]
*  So about COVID censorship Mark Zuckerberg writes in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=22.16s)]
*  In 2021 senior officials of the Biden administration including those from the White House repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=26.1s)]
*  certain COVID-19 related content including humor and satire and expressed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=33.78s)]
*  Significant frustration when we did not meet their demands [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=38.72s)]
*  I believe the government pressure was wrong and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=42.02s)]
*  On that point a few minutes ago a White House official told us [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  When confronted with a deadly pandemic this administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=51.459999999999994s)]
*  Our position has been clear and consistent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  We believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=62.58s)]
*  While making independent choices about the information they present and that's not all Zuckerberg is also writing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=69.78s)]
*  About hunter biden censorship. He says when we saw a new york post story reporting on corruption allegations [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=77.78s)]
*  Including involving then democratic presidential nominee joe biden's family [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  We sent that story to fact checkers for review and temporarily [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=89.78s)]
*  Demoted it while we were waiting for a reply. It's since been made clear that the reporting was not [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=94.8s)]
*  Russian disinformation and in retrospect we should not have demoted the story [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=101.3s)]
*  I asked president biden about this at the time his team was apparently trying to censor this hunter content [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=107.38s)]
*  You still think that the stories from the fall about your son hunter were [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=115.46s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes god love you man, you're a one horse pony [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=124.66s)]
*  And we've still never heard anybody from the white house come out to admit what we all now know [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=130.18s)]
*  That it was not russian disinformation despite what president biden said there at the end of 2020 and what his team told us [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=136.9s)]
*  Once they took office in 2021 back to you. Hey. Hey, mr [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=145.46s)]
*  One horse pony, um just reminding us of those sound bites [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=149.54s)]
*  So so even I think over a year in office you asked jensaki [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=153.06s)]
*  About the same thing and they stuck to their guns. They said absolutely it was russian disinformation. So that was apparently just their line [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=158.34s)]
*  Yes, and they continued to treat that letter that was signed by a couple dozen former intel agents [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  Who were talking about their opinions of russian disinformation that remained the gospel? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=174.34s)]
*  here and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=182.26s)]
*  Again, we we know that this is not russian disinformation. Yeah, but we've never actually heard anybody [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=183.86s)]
*  Correct that the way that mark zuckerberg did with this letter [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=190.02s)]
*  Right, uh, thanks so much peter. Here's the other yeah, here's the other thing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=194.18s)]
*  It affected the debate [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=198.74s)]
*  Because he was going to go down and say what are you doing with this? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  Uh, the you're the biden family doing with these investments and he they stopped it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=203.38s)]
*  He goes well that laptop 51 intel agents and knowing that joe biden looked at the camera knew it was his son's laptop [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  That just fundamentally, you know [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=213.46s)]
*  That if someone's that comfortable lying to 50 million people would make you think he stopped when he got the job [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=215.3s)]
*  Affected the election too. Remember the poll that people were asking you knew about the laptop story [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=220.82s)]
*  Which was not being reported on any other network [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=225.38s)]
*  Would you have voted for biden and a lot of people said no you you would think that if anybody [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=228.1s)]
*  You know trump put the cei the fbi director there the cia director there [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=232.42s)]
*  He had his director of national intelligence say I don't know what they're talking about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=236.9s)]
*  This laptop is real and no one listened to radcliffe. I just wonder what what are we supposed to say to zuckerberg? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=240.98s)]
*  Like three and a half years later like thank you. I mean it just seems to me that every single story or major scandal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=246.9s)]
*  People we have to report on when people are late and we've been talking about this from the very beginning [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=254.5s)]
*  We have reporters on to source this stuff and we talked about the political pressure and the intel agencies [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=260.26s)]
*  Having some uh corruption in the higher echelon [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=266.26s)]
*  Not the rank-and-file people that are just trying to do the job and he comes around three years [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=268.98s)]
*  Three and a half years later saying look we got it all wrong, but the election is over now [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=273.06s)]
*  So what are they going to do different in this election? Are they are they hands off? Well, we [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=277.06s)]
*  The last thing he would say is thank you to him because he said in this letter and you can see it on foxnews.com [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=282.26s)]
*  He said look the administration pressured us, but ultimately ultimately it was our decision [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=287.86s)]
*  We own that decision. So, you know the fbi said look out for disinformation and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=294.18s)]
*  Facebook is the one that screwed this up completely and so why is he doing it now? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=300.26s)]
*  Because the house judiciary committee is looking into it and they're talking about regulating his company [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=304.9s)]
*  That is the last thing he wants [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=310.82s)]
*  He doesn't want the government breathing down his throat because he wants to be able to make the decisions that led to these [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=312.82s)]
*  Ill-fated choices that they made back in 2020 [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=319.22s)]
*  He wants to be able to continue to make him even though he should not have been able to do that. He should have said look [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  We're not it's a jump ball here. We're just going to throw that out. Well social media platforms [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  They should not be able to compromise their standards because they're being pressured by an administration whether or not that's republicans [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=333.05999999999995s)]
*  But they're protected by [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  520 well, um at the time of covet [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=342.58s)]
*  Facebook publicly had a stated goal and that was to push millions of people to get the covet 19 vaccine [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=345.84s)]
*  Why are they pushing that message? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=352.17999999999995s)]
*  Why don't they just allow Lawrence to comment on Facebook Steve to comment anyone out there [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=354.5s)]
*  It's a public forum to be able to comment as long as it's not putting anyone in danger and not threatening [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=359.06s)]
*  Then the then the people who are on Facebook and make up their own mind. I'm Steve. Juicy. I'm Brian [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVMsaCTgBY&t=363.7s)]
