# This is one of the Republicans' challenges, says Vivek Ramaswamy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk)
*  Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=0.0s)]
*  Vivek, we're going to get to a moment to your book and to Fox Nation special and something [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=4.0s)]
*  airing on Fox tonight that you're working on. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=7.44s)]
*  But first, kind of what do you make of Kamala Harris jumping at the opportunity to debate [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=9.6s)]
*  and Donald Trump saying, I'm good. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, the reality is they want to go back to CNN, which has already hosted a debate, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  do the same format without any people in the room and likely biased moderators. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=22.2s)]
*  I think there's a conversation to be had, Pete, about whether or not there's going to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=26.16s)]
*  be a different format with a town hall where you actually hear directly from voters, where [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=29.08s)]
*  moderators and networks can't really tilt the scales quite as easily. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=33.96s)]
*  Maybe with a different network, maybe even Fox hosting that debate. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=37.96s)]
*  I think that would provide a sense of balance and true diversity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=41.28s)]
*  But at this point, what are people going to get out of another staged charade? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=44.28s)]
*  I think Donald Trump has a great point. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=47.36s)]
*  And the reality is he is connecting directly with voters outside of that media filter. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=49.46s)]
*  That's working well. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=55.04s)]
*  And I think that's what the Harris campaign is worried about. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=56.04s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=57.84s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=58.84s)]
*  How about the vice presidential debate? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=59.84s)]
*  When you see Tim Walz and you see JD Vance, what do you anticipate in about a week? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, look, I think that if this is a debate decided on the merits, JD is a good friend [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=65.44s)]
*  of mine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=70.0s)]
*  He and I have had plenty of our own debates over the years in a friendly way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=71.0s)]
*  I can tell you, he's an intelligent guy who's thoughtful and will stand well on the merits [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  of policy and ideas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=78.5s)]
*  I think the question again comes down to what types of media filters are applied to this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=80.12s)]
*  Many people may not watch the vice presidential debate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  So the question is, how does the media spin it afterwards? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=87.32s)]
*  Because mark my words, many more people will see what the media says about the debate than [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=90.28s)]
*  seeing what actually happened at the debate, which again is one of the Republicans' challenges. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=95.56s)]
*  I'll say this, though. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=100.08s)]
*  I don't mean to sound like a Republican victim or something. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=101.08s)]
*  We're not victims. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  It's our objective to be victorious. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  It's not an even playing field. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=106.72s)]
*  It never has been. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  But our only choice is to step up and win by such a margin that we actually reunite [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=109.84s)]
*  this country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  And so that's the work we have cut out ahead of us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm not here to complain about it, just stating the facts as they are. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=117.04s)]
*  That's our objective, and that sets the bar for us in winning this election. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=120.72s)]
*  Well, one of the things you did when you were running for president was say, I'm going to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=123.36s)]
*  tell you the truth. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=126.64s)]
*  And you may not want to hear the truth. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=127.76s)]
*  It may not be popular, but I'm going to level with you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=129.04s)]
*  We've got a new book coming out called Truths. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=131.8s)]
*  You've got a Fox Nation special. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=134.24s)]
*  And also, it's going to air tonight on the Fox News Channel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=136.04s)]
*  So it's called Truths with Vivek Ramaswamy tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern Time on Fox. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=139.12s)]
*  Here's a quick preview of some of what you'll see. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=143.32s)]
*  What do you think is one of our main learnings as we think about this question of who are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=146.6s)]
*  we, national identity? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=150.44s)]
*  What does that say about where we are today? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  I think there are people who, after Donald Trump got elected, for them, suddenly the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=155.0s)]
*  issue of government interference and the speech landscape. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=159.6s)]
*  Once upon a time, we had confidence in the public and in audiences to make the right [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=163.92s)]
*  decisions if they were well informed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Now people believe that the voting public can't be left to their own devices, that they [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=170.32s)]
*  have to be manipulated and managed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Therefore we can tolerate a certain amount of censorship. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=177.48s)]
*  Vivek, a lot of interesting people around that table, not all of which would agree with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the reality is that's the whole point of the book and this point of the series as [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=189.12s)]
*  The thesis of the book is the way we find our path to truth is through free speech and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=190.12s)]
*  open debate, including with those who disagree with us. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=194.04s)]
*  So the point of the book is to arm people at home with arguments to talk to their left [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=197.56s)]
*  leaning friends, their left leaning family members at the dinner table. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=201.32s)]
*  What we did with the special is we then brought people who disagreed with one another to that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=205.0s)]
*  dinner table. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=208.84s)]
*  The one you just played, for example, which will air tonight at 10pm on Fox, brought together [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=209.96s)]
*  at the same table a Russian journalist who you just heard from who lived, an American [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=213.96s)]
*  journalist, excuse me, who lived in Russia for over 10 years, a Russian immigrant to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=217.8s)]
*  the United States, a Jewish rabbi from Yale's campus who's a great longtime friend of mine, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=221.6s)]
*  and a Muslim woman who worked in the Biden administration, also a friend of mine, at [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=226.44s)]
*  even talking about issues like Ukraine and Russia, Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=231.2s)]
*  You don't get those people together at the same table that much in America anymore. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  So that's one of the things we want to demonstrate through this special is the more people talk [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=239.92s)]
*  to each other openly without filters, that's how we get our country back and that's why [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=242.92s)]
*  I wrote the book and I'm hopeful the special is able to show a bit of that in action at [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=247.2s)]
*  the dinner table. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=250.92s)]
*  Really interesting. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=251.92s)]
*  So if you liked what Vivek Ramaswamy had to say on the campaign trail, talking truths, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=252.92s)]
*  you're going to like this special tonight at 10 p.m. along with the book called truths. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=256.76s)]
*  You get a chance to sort of understand how you think, how you make the arguments to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=261.08s)]
*  left so we can make those very same arguments. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=264.12s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, congratulations on the book, on the film, on everything on Fox Nation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=267.12s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RROAqCnskCk&t=271.56s)]
