# Trump extends olive branch to Gov. Hochul after bombshell remark
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0)
*  We want a strong and powerful military and ideally we don't have to use it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, we had no wars for years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=5.24s)]
*  We had no wars except we defeated ISIS. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=7.36s)]
*  We defeated ISIS in record time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=11.1s)]
*  But we had no wars. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=14.9s)]
*  They said, he will start a war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=15.9s)]
*  I'm not going to start a war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=17.72s)]
*  I'm going to stop wars. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=18.72s)]
*  President Trump taking immediate action, speaking with leaders across the globe in the 24 hours [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=20.92s)]
*  after he secured victory. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  So what will foreign policy look like under President Trump's leadership? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=27.88s)]
*  Former GOP congressman and New York gubernatorial candidate Lee Seldin joins us now with more. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=32.48s)]
*  Lee, thanks for being here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=37.16s)]
*  What does a in a second term here, what does a Trump foreign policy look like? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=39.84s)]
*  A continuation of a lot that worked when President Trump was in the office the first time and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=46.96s)]
*  President Trump's next term victories have actually already begun. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=51.72s)]
*  The election was this past Tuesday. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  We already have the European Union indicating that they'll purchase now possibly your United [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=56.68s)]
*  States natural gas to avoid Trump tariffs. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=62.12s)]
*  There was a caravan that was coming through Mexico that was pretty massive, already cut [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=65.56s)]
*  in half. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=69.44s)]
*  Qatar kicking Hamas out of its country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=70.44s)]
*  President Trump already speaking to President Zelensky about ending the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=74.32s)]
*  That bit that you just played from President Trump on election night is exactly a peace [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=78.72s)]
*  through strength model that worked of ending foreign wars instead of starting new ones [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  about having a military that was focused on being America's defenders instead of a woke [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  social experiment and understanding that we need to treat friends as friends and adversaries [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=92.24s)]
*  as adversaries as abroad and never sending our troops into harm's way where they're set [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=97.32s)]
*  up to fail. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=102.36s)]
*  President Trump has had four years of success from the Abraham Accords who are drawing from [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=104.16s)]
*  the Iran nuclear deal and more. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=108.08s)]
*  I think it's about picking up from where he left off and then some. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=109.96s)]
*  I think his next term is going to be even greater than the last one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=113.6s)]
*  Which which aspect of that do you think is most crucial? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  Because you just laid out a great a list of things that have been done and will be done [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  when you when you're looking at moves he'll make early on. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  What do you put at the top of the list? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=127.56s)]
*  Listen, the hottest commodity that President Trump's going to have his time and President [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=130.4s)]
*  Trump isn't going to have the luxury of just picking one to focus on on day one. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=135.76s)]
*  President Trump is going to have the ability with good personnel around him and good policies [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=140.84s)]
*  around him to look at all of the regions that are an issue and tackle all of them simultaneously [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=144.44s)]
*  out of the gate. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=151.12s)]
*  So we have to combat illegal immigration and what's coming up through Mexico and flying [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=152.3s)]
*  into our country from other countries at the same time as looking at an issue in Israel [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=156.62s)]
*  and their existential threats around them to Ukraine and especially China. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=163.0s)]
*  I think President Trump is going to have all of this at the top of the list and he's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=167.7s)]
*  going to be tackling all of it on day one. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=172.94s)]
*  That southern border and our vulnerability there is a national security issue that will [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=173.94s)]
*  certainly be part of the many things he'll be addressing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=177.78s)]
*  Help us out Lee. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=181.78s)]
*  You know New York politics very well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=182.78s)]
*  It's been an interesting week in New York. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=184.22s)]
*  So you have that Letitia James press conference, which was bizarre and super anti Trump and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=186.54s)]
*  presumed she presumed he's coming after everybody and she holds this press conference. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=191.42s)]
*  Yet Donald Trump had a very cordial call, according to Governor Hokel, a call with her [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=196.18s)]
*  about working in New York. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=200.02s)]
*  So who's right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=202.34s)]
*  What's the future of how Donald Trump interacts with New York state and New York City? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=203.66s)]
*  President Trump is showing that he truly wants to be the president for all Americans. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=209.9s)]
*  And it doesn't matter whether or not you're from a blue state, a red state, a purple state. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=214.34s)]
*  And inside of that state, you don't have to be a Republican or Democrat. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=218.46s)]
*  Now, Kathy Hokel in 22 called on Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin to leave New York. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=220.62s)]
*  Just a couple of weeks ago, she was saying that if you don't vote Democrat, if you vote [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=226.38s)]
*  for President Trump, that you're anti American. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=229.38s)]
*  That's not stopping President Trump from wanting to be a president for all Americans. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=232.38s)]
*  So this is about the people of New York. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=237.34s)]
*  This isn't about a clash of partisanship through parties. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=239.7s)]
*  President Trump is making it clear to blue state governors out there and blue city mayors [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=244.18s)]
*  out there that he wants to be able to work with everybody in order to deliver for all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=248.2s)]
*  Americans. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=252.46s)]
*  I absolutely love it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  And it's truly the leadership that we needed for unity that President Biden spoke about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  on his inauguration and gave up on the next day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=259.06s)]
*  Yeah, they speak about it all the time and then they never really follow through. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=261.66s)]
*  And what they've missed about Trump from the beginning is he actually is a businessman [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=265.3s)]
*  who wants to make things better and is willing to work with people, even if they dissed him [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=269.82s)]
*  and disagree with him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  As you point out, Kathy Hokel been no fan of Donald Trump or Lee Zeldin. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  But Lee, you gave it a heck of a run and we hope you do again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=279.08s)]
*  It's great to see you, Lee. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfK4ejFMy-0&t=281.26s)]
