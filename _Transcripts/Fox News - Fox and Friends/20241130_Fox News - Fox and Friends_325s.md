# Biden calls out Trump’s tariff plan, says it is ‘counterproductive’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0)
*  Welcome back. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited President-elect Trump with his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=0.0s)]
*  incoming White House team at Mar-a-Lago there to share concerns on a proposed 25 percent tariffs [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=5.68s)]
*  on Canadian and Mexico goods. This is just one day after President Biden had this to say about the issue. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=12.0s)]
*  I hope he rethinks it. I think it's a counterproductive thing to do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=24.8s)]
*  We have an unusual situation in America. We're surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=28.4s)]
*  and two allies, Mexico and Canada. The last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=34.08s)]
*  relationships. I think we've got them in a good place. Here to react, co-founder of the Committee [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  to Unleash Prosperity, Stephen Moore. Stephen, good morning. Thanks for joining us. When we watch that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=45.92s)]
*  clip, we see President Biden urging President-elect Trump not to do this. What is the political [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=50.72s)]
*  motivation of President Biden, not just weighing in on this, but weighing in in that direction? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=56.4s)]
*  Well, I don't know what Joe Biden's motivation is, but I know what Donald Trump's motivation is, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=62.16s)]
*  and I think it's really important for people to understand what's going on here. One of the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=66.8s)]
*  leading killers of young people in America today is fentanyl and illegal drugs coming into this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=71.84s)]
*  country, and it is tragic. It's almost like our enemies. By the way, don't forget that China is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=77.92s)]
*  part of this too, a major player here, and they are importing this poison into our country that is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=83.28s)]
*  lethal, that is heartbreaking what's happening to our young people. So, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=89.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is the first president who's actually taking action here, and he's simply saying to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=93.84s)]
*  China, to Canada, and Mexico, if you're a friend of the United States, if you're a friendly country, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  stop importing this lethal drug into our country. And I do believe, by the way, and by the way, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=105.44s)]
*  I'm a free trade guy. I don't like tariffs as a general matter, but I've seen it work in his [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=111.28s)]
*  first term, firsthand, where Trump uses the threat of tariffs to force countries to do things that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  are America's interests, and I think we all agree keeping fentanyl out of this country is in America's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=123.04s)]
*  national interest. Yeah, when you see Justin Trudeau go down to Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=127.76s)]
*  President Trump, and there's pictures of him smiling, if you look back, Trudeau has, he's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=132.8s)]
*  stymied immigration in his own country. We have had terrorist, terror watch lists caught at the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=138.08s)]
*  Canadian border, so it isn't like this is a non-issue. It isn't like Canada is exempt from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  the border problem. What do you think the outcome is here? Do you see anything [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  signaling that we're going to get something out of Canada in lieu of not imposing these tariffs? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=151.84s)]
*  Well, listen, I think the outcome is here is going to be positive for the United States and for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Canada and Mexico. I mean, we all should join together. The whole Reagan vision was that North [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=163.12s)]
*  America would be a large free trade zone. Well, part of free trade cannot be allowing these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=169.04s)]
*  chemicals and these drugs into our country. I mean, it's so obvious. So I think that what's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=175.04s)]
*  going to happen, because look, Canada and Mexico have to trade with the United States. We do have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=180.4s)]
*  leverage over them, and I think in the end of the day they will cooperate. We will reduce the amount [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=184.56s)]
*  of these illegal drugs in the country, and every one of us will be better off. So I'm positive about [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=190.08s)]
*  this. I think it's going to be very favorable to the United States, and we're going to reduce this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=195.36s)]
*  scourge of drug overdoses in our country. Yeah, I think we can't ignore the fact that the economy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=200.08s)]
*  was a top two issue in the election, if not the top issue for a lot of people. I want to read this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  New York Post headline to you. It says, Trump voters poised to spend big for the holidays, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=210.8s)]
*  but Harrisbackers are cutting back. I'll back this up with a graphic here that shows a 50.4% [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=215.76s)]
*  tick uptick in spending in red states, with an 11.2% drop in blue states. So is this just a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=222.72s)]
*  mood thing? Are Trump voters just, they're happier so they're in the Christmas spirit, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=230.16s)]
*  or is this really a result of people believing, hey, the economy is going to be better if they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=235.12s)]
*  voted for Trump? I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, you know, look, we are two countries right [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=239.92s)]
*  now, a red state and blue state, and you're there in New York, and New York's a pretty blue state, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=245.2s)]
*  and so you've got a lot of somber Democrats. But I got to tell you, look, everywhere I go, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  and I travel a lot, I just see a new bounce in the step of people. You're just walking down the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  street, people are in a better mood, they're confident. This isn't just impressionistic. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=258.48s)]
*  The statistics show very clearly, consumer confidence took its biggest jump in November, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=262.56s)]
*  practically ever in history. You see this with small business confidence. You see it with people [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  going to the malls. I mean, my God, have you been to the malls this weekend? They're completely [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=272.48s)]
*  packed with people. And one last point about this, even some of my Democratic friends who [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  didn't like Trump very much, they want to give him a chance here. They see him as maybe a guy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=281.36s)]
*  who can end the scourge of inflation, who can get this economy moving again, bring blue collar jobs [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=286.8s)]
*  to back to America. So it's not just Republicans even. By the way, Trump has the highest [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=291.92s)]
*  favorability rating today than he's ever had in history. It's amazing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=297.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think if you go back to 2016, there was a Trump effect before he took office where the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=302.32s)]
*  economy started to get better because the belief was there. This is the first indication of that, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=306.8s)]
*  I guess. Steve Moore, thanks for joining us. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORKCx1tvM0&t=312.08s)]
