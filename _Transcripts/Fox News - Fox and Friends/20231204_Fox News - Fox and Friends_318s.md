# Newt Gingrich: It's time for decent people to say ENOUGH
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE)
*  anti-Israel mob swarming a Jewish-owned falafel shop in Philadelphia hurling those anti-Semitic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=0.0s)]
*  chants as pro-Palestinian riots continue to erupt across our country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=23.2s)]
*  House Speaker Newt Gimler, author of the best seller's book, March to the Majority, is here to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=28.24s)]
*  react. Newt, they keep saying this has nothing to do with the Jewish people, that they're standing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=32.44s)]
*  up for free Palestine. So why target a local Jewish deli? Well, because the fact is their idea of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=39.56s)]
*  standing up for Palestine is to wipe out every Jew in Israel. Remember when Hamas talks, they're [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=50.28s)]
*  very clear about this. They say not a single Jew will remain. So let's not kid each other. The [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=56.52s)]
*  people who are out there rallying for Hamas are rallying for terrorism and for genocide. And [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  frankly, we should be much more aggressive in responding to it and much more aggressive in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=68.72s)]
*  deporting any student who's here on a student visa, who's involved in this kind of pro-terrorist, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=74.92s)]
*  pro-genocide position. And we should also be investigating our universities who have become [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=82.88s)]
*  basically hothouses for growing people who I think are crazy. I mean, their position would involve [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=88.24s)]
*  wiping out all the people in Israel. And I don't think they understand it. I think their professors [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=94.24s)]
*  have totally misled them. And I think that it's time for decent people to stand up and say enough. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=99.84s)]
*  You're absolutely right. Another topic, we were speaking of this earlier, climate czar John Kerry [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=105.68s)]
*  was over at the COP summit. And essentially what he said was, we've got to pull the plug on all [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  coal plants, all coal mines, all coal mining in the United States. You know, he said we can rely [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  on wind and solar and stuff like that. And he's right, we might be able to do that someday. We [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=126.92000000000002s)]
*  can't do it today because right now for affordable energy, you need coal. That's what America runs on. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=132.16s)]
*  Look, I think having billionaires or multimillionaires like John Kerry [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=142.64s)]
*  fly around the world. Remember, there's an entire climate change industry. There were 400,000 people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=147.2s)]
*  at Doha, 400,000. They're all gathered together to earn a living off the taxpayers of the world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=155.28s)]
*  Selling us stuff that doesn't work. The Europeans will tell you, relying on wind and relying on solar [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  means one, you'll go broke. And two, you're going to be very cold in the winter and very hot in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=168.0s)]
*  summer because the systems don't work enough to replace fossil fuels. What you have, and you're [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=173.04s)]
*  seeing this, by the way, with automobiles, where auto dealers have written Biden and said, we can't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  sell the cars. Government mandates don't work if the customers refuse to show up. So I mean, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=183.68s)]
*  Kerry basically represents the insanely extreme wing of the environmental movement. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=190.96s)]
*  I taught environmental studies. I think there are a lot of practical, common sense things you can do, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=196.32s)]
*  none of which would appeal to John Kerry. The House Speaker, Mike Johnson, was on Fox and Friends [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=201.04s)]
*  this weekend, and he says he believes that they do have the votes to make that impeachment inquiry [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=206.24s)]
*  into Joe Biden happen. Listen to this. We're being stonewalled by the White House because [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=210.24s)]
*  they're preventing at least two to three DOJ witnesses from coming forward. A formal impeachment [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=215.68s)]
*  inquiry vote on the floor will allow us to take it to the next necessary step. And I think it's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  something we have to do at this juncture. Do you have the votes to actually formally [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=225.12s)]
*  start an impeachment process? Yeah, I believe we will. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=229.36s)]
*  Nick, what's your reaction? Well, look, I think if you're a Democrat, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=232.24s)]
*  you have to ask yourself, do you want to vote against learning what happened with Chinese money, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=237.44s)]
*  Russian money, Kazakhstan money, Romanian money, Ukraine money? Do you really want to go home and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=242.24s)]
*  say, yes, I defended Joe Biden's right to be a crook? If you're a Republican, do you really [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=247.44s)]
*  want to guarantee a primary opponent by voting against it, looking at it? This doesn't impeach [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=251.84s)]
*  him. This simply gives Congress additional power to force the White House to reveal documents and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=257.68s)]
*  to force people to come and testify. And frankly, given the amount we've learned already about the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=264.72s)]
*  money that came in from all these dictatorships and the degree to which the Biden family is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  essentially corrupt, I think the American people deserve to know whether or not their commander in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=275.2s)]
*  chief is in fact in debt to the Chinese dictator, the Russian dictator, et cetera. It's really [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=280.32s)]
*  pretty shocking and probably the biggest presidential scandal in American history. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=287.12s)]
*  Yeah. You just got to wonder if the Republicans are going to ever be unified. They shouldn't have [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=292.08s)]
*  to depend on Democrats' votes for this measure. They should be able to vote for this alone, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=296.72s)]
*  but I guess they'll have to explain that to their voters. Newt, thanks so much for joining the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=301.36s)]
*  program. Thank you, sir. Thank you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALLsCExaPE&t=305.20000000000005s)]
