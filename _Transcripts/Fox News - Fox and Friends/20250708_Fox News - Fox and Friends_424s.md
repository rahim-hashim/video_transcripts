# Dems ramp up anti-ICE rhetoric: 'GET SHOT'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8)
*  Federal immigration agents are facing increased threats of violence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=0.0s)]
*  After multiple incidents in Texas this week, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=4.4s)]
*  saw gunmen ambush officers right outside their building. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=7.4s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us live with the details. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=11.8s)]
*  Good morning, Maddie. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=14.4s)]
*  Good morning. The Department of Homeland Security says [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=15.5s)]
*  the number of assaults against ICE agents has increased significantly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=18.1s)]
*  And there have been some high-profile incidents in just the last few days alone. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=22.5s)]
*  Yesterday, a gunman was shot and killed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  after police say he started shooting at a Border Patrol annex in McAllen, Texas. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  The suspect was identified as 27-year-old Ryan Lewis Musqueda. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  The attack in McAllen came days after another violent incident in Texas just outside of Dallas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=39.0s)]
*  Authorities say an officer from Alvarado was shot in the neck [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=45.4s)]
*  after several people opened fire on officers outside the Prairie Land Detention Center, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=48.9s)]
*  which is an ICE facility. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=54.0s)]
*  The Justice Department is calling this an organized ambush, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=55.8s)]
*  adding that some of the suspects were wearing body armor and had two-way radios. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=58.6s)]
*  Ten people were charged. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=63.4s)]
*  DHS tells Fox assaults against ICE agents are up nearly 700 percent over the same time last year. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=65.4s)]
*  Last year, there were 10 assaults from January to June. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=72.2s)]
*  This year, there have been 79 assaults within the same timeframe. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=75.6s)]
*  I've been warning about this for two months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=81.2s)]
*  The ramped-up rhetoric is going to cause a situation where someone loses their life. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=83.4s)]
*  We saw that today. I was hoping I'd be wrong, but I wasn't. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=87.4s)]
*  And I'll tell you something else. It's not the end. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=90.4s)]
*  Unless we stop the hateful rhetoric against ICE and Border Patrol comparing them to Nazis, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=93.0s)]
*  there's going to be more situations like that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  The attacks in Texas remain under investigation, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  and officials say anyone involved in attacking law enforcement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  will be prosecuted to the fullest extent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=108.0s)]
*  Griff, Emily and Charlie. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  As they should. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=112.4s)]
*  Matty Rivera. Thank you very much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=113.4s)]
*  You know, the thing to remember here is that these ICE agents, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=116.2s)]
*  they are doing exactly what elected legislators are ordering them to do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  They are enforcing the laws that have been duly enacted by the legislature. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=128.0s)]
*  And Democrats spent a lot of time talking about law and order. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=134.0s)]
*  And the idea that these people are paying the price for enforcing the laws [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=136.6s)]
*  that Democrats helped put on the books is unconscionable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=142.0s)]
*  And I think we're at a position right now where, you know, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=145.4s)]
*  Democrat lawmakers have allowed this problem to metastasize, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=149.0s)]
*  and they don't know how to control what they've created. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=153.4s)]
*  And so you have these scenes like the one we saw yesterday, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=156.6s)]
*  where you have Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=159.4s)]
*  you know, marching out into the streets trying to interfere with ICE operations. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=162.4s)]
*  And at some point, an adult in the Democrat Party is going to have to stand up [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=167.8s)]
*  and say, we do not stand for this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah. I mean, look, the threat environment against federal law enforcement [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=175.6s)]
*  has possibly never been higher than right now. Now, why is that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  It's because the rhetoric of the Democrats are not coming down. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=185.0s)]
*  Do you have a Hakeem Jeffries in Washington, the leader of the Democrats [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=188.2s)]
*  in the House of Representatives, likening ICE to Nazis? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  You've got Karen Bass in California. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=196.5s)]
*  You've also got in San Diego a city councilman a month ago, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  calling, you know, writing terrorists over ICE enforcement officers, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=201.6s)]
*  saying, you know, the community should fight back. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=205.4s)]
*  You've got a member of Congress getting arrested at Newark. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=207.6s)]
*  I mean, it's almost as if they're choosing that as a playbook to double down. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=210.6s)]
*  I thought it was interesting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=215.1s)]
*  Axios had a piece talking to unnamed sources who are Democrats, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=216.6s)]
*  saying that they want to pretty much just keep ramping it up and double down on that card. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=221.6s)]
*  Here's a little bit of what they found out about this anti-Trump, anti-ICE resistance. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  Axios Democrats telling people to get shot for this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=230.8s)]
*  Here's a quote. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=235.0s)]
*  The grassroots wants more. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=236.0s)]
*  Some of them have suggested what we really need to do is be willing to get shot [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  when visiting ICE facilities or federal agencies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=243.5s)]
*  A third House Democrat told Axios, unbelievable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  Here was White House First Secretary, Caroline Levitt, yesterday responding to that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=251.8s)]
*  It's hard to believe anyone with morals in this country or decency would say such a thing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=257.0s)]
*  Obviously, the White House condemns that rhetoric and we condemn violence of any kind. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=262.6s)]
*  This administration is simply trying to enforce our laws and we must be a nation of law and order. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=266.8s)]
*  You cannot simply waltz across our border and live here illegally and expect to stay. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=272.0s)]
*  We are going to enforce our nation's laws and the men and women who are doing that are doing so in a respectful way. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=277.0s)]
*  They are doing so within the confines of the law and they are just trying to do their jobs. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  And we condemn any violence or any calls for violence of any kind against any American. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, when the press secretary speaks, it is so clear and concise and in such stark contrast [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  to those Democratic legislators who are responsible for much of the legislation that is being enforced [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=298.0s)]
*  that with such mealy-mouthed and uptick rhetoric, advocate for violence. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=303.5s)]
*  And they use this hyperbolic speech that has zero place in our society right now, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=311.1s)]
*  likening ICE to fascism, likening the president to Hitler and worse. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=315.5s)]
*  And they also are, I mean, I'll say they aren't even subtle about it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=319.3s)]
*  I mean, they are calling actively to dox ICE agents. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=323.0s)]
*  They are cheering that app that will obstruct justice and render vulnerable ICE agents even more. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=326.0s)]
*  How far will they go? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=332.5s)]
*  I mean, you read it just then. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  They want to get shot because they are only about performative stunts for their elite Petri dish [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=335.3s)]
*  that is so insular and they have no idea what real Americans go through, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=340.4s)]
*  which is their loved ones are out there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=344.2s)]
*  Their loved ones are ICE agents. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=346.7s)]
*  ICE agents are part of the community. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=348.2s)]
*  They are part of the fabric of American existence. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  And we support and respect and cherish them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=352.7s)]
*  And this all-out assault on them, it has to stop before it gets worse. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=355.4s)]
*  And of course, the crimes that the ICE agents are trying to prevent by removing criminal aliens [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  from our midst are happening in the neighborhoods where those people live. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=365.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=371.2s)]
*  They are the ones that are paying the brunt of it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=371.6s)]
*  You put a really important point though on something, Emily, and that is the human aspect. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=373.7s)]
*  Can you imagine being the spouse of an ICE officer or a board of patrol agent or the daughter [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=378.5s)]
*  or the son knowing that this is what they're walking out in? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=384.3s)]
*  The attack in Alvarado, Texas, ten individuals have now been charged with attempted murder [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  of a federal officer because 20 to 30 rounds from an AK-47 or assault rifle of some sort [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=393.7s)]
*  was fired at officers unprovoked. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=399.5s)]
*  They had bulletproof vests and body armor. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, we are at a point now where there should be bipartisan calls to tone it down. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  Yet there isn't. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=412.5s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=414.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiVugjIrY8&t=415.0s)]
