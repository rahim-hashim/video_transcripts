# When should kids be allowed on social media? Clinical psychologist shares expert insights
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI)
*  Well, Australia is said to become the first country in the world to ban social media for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=0.0s)]
*  kids under 16 years of age. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=6.16s)]
*  Australia's prime minister saying, quote, this is a landmark reform. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=8.88s)]
*  We know some kids will find workarounds, but we're sending a message to social media companies [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=13.14s)]
*  to clean up their act. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Here with more on the impact this law could have for kids is clinical psychologist, Kevin [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=19.54s)]
*  Gilliland, and he joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=24.52s)]
*  Doctor, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=27.32s)]
*  This is such a fascinating topic. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=30.180000000000003s)]
*  What's your view? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=33.04s)]
*  Is Australia doing the right thing here? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=34.04s)]
*  Honestly, I think they are. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=35.84s)]
*  Good morning and happy holidays. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=38.08s)]
*  Always good to be with you guys. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=41.0s)]
*  They've planted a pretty strong flag, if you will. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=42.64s)]
*  Other countries are looking at it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=45.92s)]
*  And I think what they're saying more than anything is parents are saying something, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=47.6s)]
*  which is we don't have the time to wait for big tech to do the right thing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=52.2s)]
*  We need help. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  And we're asking for governments to think about doing that and step in. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  It's a reasonable request. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=63.24s)]
*  We typically require an age before we consume things or step into things that are powerful, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  whether it's driving, voting, alcohol, and make no mistake about it, social media is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  powerful. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  What's the age you recommend to begin allowing children to use? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=77.32s)]
*  We have this debate all the time, but I'm interested in your thoughts. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=82.52s)]
*  OK, so I tend to land in the spot of 15 or 16 years old. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=85.44s)]
*  The US has talked about 13, but have you been around a seventh grader? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=90.24s)]
*  And then have you been around a ninth grader, tenth grader? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=93.88s)]
*  There's a reason we separate them at that age. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=97.24s)]
*  Most schools have junior high and high school for a reason. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=100.08s)]
*  You want a little bit of cognitive development and a little bit of judgment to improve. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=103.36s)]
*  Allow some brain development. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=108.72s)]
*  And what you're really saying is we need to protect those brains and allow them to develop [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=110.68s)]
*  in a healthy way with healthy things. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=115.76s)]
*  So what are we protecting them from when we talk about social media and this? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=118.4s)]
*  I think of it, I have nine kids, doctor. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=123.28s)]
*  And so we always say the best part about nine kids is you get a lot of do-overs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=125.72s)]
*  So the older kids, I think we gave it to them too early. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=129.94s)]
*  We let them have them in junior high. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=133.38s)]
*  I'm with you 100 percent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=134.38s)]
*  And we keep moving it back. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=135.9s)]
*  My concern is mostly access to pornography. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=137.98s)]
*  That would be a top concern. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=144.02s)]
*  Loss of attention, you know, loss of attention because I think it destroys their ability [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=146.46s)]
*  to concentrate. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=151.26s)]
*  And just it's designed for addiction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=152.66s)]
*  It addicts adults. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=155.02s)]
*  Of course, it's going to addict children. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=156.02s)]
*  What are your concerns? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=158.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  So you point out two things that are really critical. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  And yeah, you should, if you can, have more than one kid to realize, hey, I'm sorry, I'm [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=162.74s)]
*  not that good at a parent. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=166.86s)]
*  And yeah, we're trusting y'all to develop some skills and abilities. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=168.58s)]
*  And if you start from a place of what are those qualities you're trying to instill in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=172.9s)]
*  your kids, start with that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=177.38s)]
*  Just the short list of who do you want them to become and then foster those activities [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=179.62s)]
*  that lead to that and protect against those that don't support that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=185.9s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=190.5s)]
*  Social media has this rather rapid stimulus response effect and it can condition our brains. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=191.5s)]
*  That's why I say allow some brain development. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=199.26s)]
*  There is nothing better for growing physical and psychological health than being part of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=201.9s)]
*  real things in the real world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=208.54s)]
*  And so that stimulus response and leading to this lethargic lifestyle that we're all [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=211.06s)]
*  vulnerable to when we spend too much time on social media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=216.82s)]
*  And so I think what we need is we need governments to step in and really press big tech. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=221.14s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=227.18s)]
*  We need something. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=230.62s)]
*  And I ran this past some parents that I worked with all over the country and I was shocked [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=232.46s)]
*  at all of them were like, yes, we need something. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=237.06s)]
*  And these are parents that are involved and active and trying to quote do the right thing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=240.26s)]
*  So we've got to step in. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  Big tech has been way too slow to help us out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=247.46s)]
*  It's too hard as a parent. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  It's like help us out here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=251.42s)]
*  I want the government to be the bad guy, not me. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=253.14s)]
*  Sometimes I think that's helpful. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=256.46s)]
*  And listen, looking at this issue, I know I'm a libertarian. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm not a libertarian. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=261.86s)]
*  I did not like what Australia did with COVID and their lockdowns. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=262.9s)]
*  They were draconian and tyrannical. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=267.7s)]
*  But on this issue, I look at this through the prism of what is good for children and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  families. And I think this band is a great idea. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=275.46s)]
*  And I'm for it. I don't care who criticizes me about it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=278.18s)]
*  I'm with you, doctor. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  We love having you on and we'll have you back. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=282.86s)]
*  I think that these are the kind of discussions all of our viewers, especially our parents, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=285.02s)]
*  are talking about around the kitchen table. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=289.06s)]
*  So thank you for joining us. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  I was going to be with you all and good decision on your part. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=291.82s)]
*  I agree. They got this one right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=294.86s)]
*  And I think we should follow suit. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=297.06s)]
*  Amen to that. All right. Thank you, doctor. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT2b9UKwnwI&t=299.14s)]
