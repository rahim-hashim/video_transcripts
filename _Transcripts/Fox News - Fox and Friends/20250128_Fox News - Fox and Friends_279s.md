# Judge Jeanine: The left won't be able to stop this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo)
*  Meanwhile, a Fox News alert right now at this hour. Multiple federal agencies, including the DEA, the ATF, and the DOJ, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=0.0s)]
*  are descending on New York City, helping Homeland Security carry out its first deportation raids as part of President Trump's crackdown on illegal migration here in New York. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=8.0s)]
*  This comes as local officials declare ICE cannot arrest illegal migrants in New York courts without a warrant. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=19.0s)]
*  And the number of states suing to stop President Trump's birthright citizenship order grows. So where is the legal battle headed? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=27.0s)]
*  We've called in the co-host of The Five, Judge Janine Pirro joins us early. Good morning to you, Judge. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=34.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=39.0s)]
*  Okay, so they're saying ICE can come in, but they cannot arrest them without a warrant. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=40.0s)]
*  Okay, let me explain something. The reason that the president is doing this, and right now you've got the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=47.0s)]
*  Department of Drug Enforcement, DEA, and you've got DHS. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=55.0s)]
*  And DOJ. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=61.0s)]
*  And DOJ is because President Trump was elected to remove these illegals. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=62.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=68.0s)]
*  Well, the left can do whatever they can to try to stop this, but the president has literally loosened all of the restrictions on arresting those [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=69.0s)]
*  deportable aliens who were in this country illegally to begin with and are subject to automatic arrest and deportation under the expedited removal process, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=78.0s)]
*  which requires that they can be removed immediately and not even brought before an immigration judge. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=88.0s)]
*  So understand something. You can get locals to say, you can't go into a church, you can't go into a school as if I'd rather have a pedophile in the school [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=94.0s)]
*  than arrested, or you can't come into a courthouse. But the truth is, there's a supremacy clause here. This is federal immigration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=102.0s)]
*  This is emergency removals. They are illegals. They can be removed. And the left can do whatever they can. They can sue whenever they want to. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=111.0s)]
*  But they're not going to stop this because this is allowed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=119.0s)]
*  And you know, it's interesting as we look at the video and that video right there is actually from the Homeland Security Secretary, Christy Noem. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=122.0s)]
*  She put that out. As you can see, this was one of the raids overnight. We don't know exactly where these things happen in the five boroughs. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=129.0s)]
*  We just know that these images, Judge, are now going to ricochet around the world. Look, ISIS come finally to New York City. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=136.0s)]
*  But we knew this was going to happen. Donald Trump ran on it. And now, you know, he's checking that he's checking that box. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=145.0s)]
*  Look, the majority of Americans, more than the majority of Americans, want this to happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=150.0s)]
*  The Biden administration allowed these people to come into the country illegally, unvetted, and are supporting them in sanctuary cities. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=156.0s)]
*  And now they want to give them support in courthouses. Give me a break. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=164.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, what you have here are people who don't belong here, who are victimizing American citizens. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=168.0s)]
*  We pay for their education, their medication, their housing, their food, their lawyers, their translators. Enough. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=174.0s)]
*  And we saw it with Colombia. You know, the president Trump said you take him back and this is what should be happening. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=180.0s)]
*  And that is happening right now. Speaking of what's happening over on Fox Nation, you've got a new special about Karen Reed. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=186.0s)]
*  Who is Karen Reed? Well, Karen Reed is this lovely woman who's been charged with murder and right now faces a manslaughter, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=193.0s)]
*  vehicular manslaughter trial. There was a trial, a nine week trial with five days of deliberation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=201.0s)]
*  She's charged with killing her boyfriend. She, of course, is claiming that her boyfriend, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=208.0s)]
*  friends in the police department are framing her as if the police department needs a framer when his DNA and his hair is on the back of her bumper. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=213.0s)]
*  And the vehicle data on her SUV shows that she backs his 60 feet at the location where his body was found with a skull fracture. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=222.0s)]
*  He died of hypothermia. So the evidence pretty much contradicts a lot of what she's saying. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=231.0s)]
*  But at the same time, you've got a woman who has been able to attract some attention for herself. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=236.0s)]
*  And in fact, that's why this is a great title. Karen Reed, killer or convenient outsider. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=241.0s)]
*  It's available on Fox Nation right now. Judge, it looks great. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=247.0s)]
*  It is. It's a great story. And there's a reason that she's being tried a second time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=252.0s)]
*  There's a lot of feeling on both sides of this, but I think the evidence is only on one side. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=257.0s)]
*  All right. Thank you very much for joining us early. Look for her today on The Five. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=262.0s)]
*  I'll be there. Yes, you will. Thank you. Right out of this room. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=266.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YzCxtRYwWo&t=277.0s)]
