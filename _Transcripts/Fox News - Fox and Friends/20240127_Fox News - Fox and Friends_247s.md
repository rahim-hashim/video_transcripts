# Nations halt funding for UN relief group over alleged Hamas involvement
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4)
*  The U. S. Is now pausing payments temporarily to the United Nations Relief [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=0.0s)]
*  and Works Agency, UNRA in Gaza after the U. N fired 12 staffers over their [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=6.3s)]
*  alleged involvement in the October 7th attacks. But is it too late? The U. S. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=12.08s)]
*  is the biggest donor to the agency, sending $296 million last year alone [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  and nearly $1 billion since Biden took office and resumed payments after [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=26.12s)]
*  Donald Trump had stopped them in 2018. Here to react is senior V P for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=31.32s)]
*  research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy's Jonathan Schanzer. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=38.0s)]
*  Jonathan, thanks for being here. So we should note that Donald Trump stopped [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  these payments for a reason. So we knew this agency was involved in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=46.24s)]
*  nefarious work. Now it's revealed potentially involved in the terrorist [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=49.68s)]
*  attack. Break it down for us. Sure. Well, it turns out the Israelis have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=54.12s)]
*  been collecting intelligence on this group since the 10 7 attack. It looks [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  like there are about a dozen people that were involved in the murders that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  took place on October 7th. The Israelis have been actually talking to some [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=66.6s)]
*  of the people that they arrested on that day and some of the fighters that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=71.52s)]
*  they pulled out of Gaza, where they've learned more and more about how this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=74.46s)]
*  organization was directly involved in Hamas attacks. This, of course, is not [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=78.28s)]
*  anything new for folks that have been watching this agency. Over the years, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=83.28s)]
*  we've seen that there have been Hamas fighters firing rockets from within the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=87.72s)]
*  compounds of the schools and hospitals that they run. There are tunnels that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=91.64s)]
*  snake below. There's weapons storage facilities that they have within these [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=96.3s)]
*  buildings as well. So the Israelis have been on top of this for a long time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=101.96s)]
*  Obviously, the Trump administration as well. There was a series of tweets [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=106.44s)]
*  that Mike Pompeo put out in the waning days of the Trump administration warning [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  of how corrupt and nefarious this organization was, and no one seemed to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=114.64s)]
*  care over the last two or three years. That bill has obviously come due. Yeah, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=119.0s)]
*  I mean, Jonathan, it must have been evident enough the intelligence there [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=123.36s)]
*  if the Trump administration stopped funding. We knew this that if if UNRWA [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=129.72s)]
*  is able to operate inside the Gaza Strip or elsewhere, they're doing so at [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=133.84s)]
*  the behest of Hamas. And what they must have seen is that they've become an [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=137.68s)]
*  extension of that so much of an extension of that that they're willing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=141.72s)]
*  to take part in terrorist attacks on October 7th. They say they're gonna [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=145.16s)]
*  pause funding. Do you believe that? And do you think there'll be a permanent [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=148.88s)]
*  stop? Are we gonna go back to funding the people that attack our friends? Look, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=152.82s)]
*  I think it all really depends on how much evidence the Israelis are willing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=157.12s)]
*  to make public right now. We haven't actually seen what they've seen. I think [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=160.82s)]
*  a huge amount of this is really gonna hinge on whether the Israelis are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=165.96s)]
*  willing to declassify that intelligence. And then on top of that, I think the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  Israelis are probably if if you know, if I'm reading the tea leaves right, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=173.88s)]
*  they're gonna release more information about what this organization has been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=178.12s)]
*  doing over the years, the way that they've taught the kids, you know, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  beginning at age 45 to hate the Israelis to talk about martyrdom and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=186.52s)]
*  jihad on the way that they cast the Israelis as enemies. So it's an [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=190.84s)]
*  education problem. It's a funding problem. It's a terrorism problem. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=195.36s)]
*  Hopefully this is all gonna be laid bare and there'll be other agencies [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  that can step into. It's not like unra has to be the only agency that does [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  this. There are plenty of other groups within the U. N. That could probably do [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=208.08s)]
*  it better without the violence, without the corruption, without the Hamas [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  connections. There's plenty of countries also, especially in the Muslim [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=215.74s)]
*  Middle East that could fund these things as well if they had so much [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  compassion for the people being affected. Yet it seems to be us who's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=222.72s)]
*  always footing the bill and then we're footing the bill for schools that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=226.0s)]
*  teach young kids to hate the West America in Israel. Jonathan Schanzer, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=228.4s)]
*  thank you for your time. Appreciate it. Thank you. You got it. I'm Steve [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnbylDclb4&t=233.52s)]
