# 'SAVE THEIR A--': Hegseth sets record straight on new group chat allegations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y)
*  Why do you have confidence? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Because he's doing a great job. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=2.98s)]
*  Ask the hoodies how he's doing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=4.68s)]
*  Everybody's happy with him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=8.48s)]
*  We have the highest recruitment numbers I think they've had in 28 years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=9.84s)]
*  No, he's doing a great job. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=14.56s)]
*  It's just fake news. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=16.92s)]
*  That was President Trump doubling down on his support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=18.92s)]
*  24 hours ago, denying a New York Times report about sharing sensitive information on another [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=22.72s)]
*  SignalJet called Team Huddle here to set the record straight himself. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=27.6s)]
*  The current Secretary of State Pete Hegseth, former host right here on Fox and Friends. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=32.96s)]
*  Pete, great to see you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=37.2s)]
*  So your thoughts on what's been reporting of Team Huddle and the SignalJet that the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=39.56s)]
*  New York Times says took place between you, your wife, and your brother and some others. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=45.2s)]
*  So Brian, if you remember when this all started, the first go around, because this is the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  second go around, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=53.52s)]
*  They peddle old stuff. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=54.6s)]
*  They kick it back up. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=55.96s)]
*  I said repeatedly, no one's texting war plans. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=57.4s)]
*  You know why I said that? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  Because I'm in the bowels of the Pentagon every single day. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=61.84s)]
*  Just 10 minutes ago, I was looking at actual war plans of things that were ongoing or pending [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=64.32s)]
*  things to happen because that's on a regular basis on classified systems. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=68.92s)]
*  That's my job for the war fighters, for the President of the United States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=73.44s)]
*  I look at war plans every single day. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=77.28s)]
*  What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=80.0s)]
*  unclassified, coordinations for media coordination and other things. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=85.92s)]
*  That's what I've said from the beginning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=89.68s)]
*  At the beginning, it was left-wing reporters from the Atlantic who got a hold of it and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=91.76s)]
*  then wanted to create a problem for the President. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=96.08s)]
*  This is what it's all about, trying to get at President Trump and his agenda. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=98.28s)]
*  Now here at the Defense Department, because Brian, I want this to be very clear. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  We take the classification of information very important. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  It's very significant to us that we safeguard it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=109.88s)]
*  And so when we had leaks, which we have had here, we did a serious leak investigation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=112.48s)]
*  And through that leak investigation, unfortunately, we found some folks that we believe were not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  holding to the protocols that we hold dear here at the Defense Department. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=123.48s)]
*  Through that investigation, they have been moved on and that investigation continues. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=127.76s)]
*  As a result of that, everything we do here is above board trying to make sure that we [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=132.76s)]
*  safeguard information. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=138.0s)]
*  In this point, those folks who were leaking, who have been pushed out of the building, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=139.38s)]
*  are now attempting to leak and sabotage the President's agenda and what we're doing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=143.74s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=147.9s)]
*  It's not what I do. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=148.9s)]
*  It's not how we operate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=149.9s)]
*  And so you've got another allegation being pushed again, not based on how we're operating [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  around here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=156.8s)]
*  We're for the war fighters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=157.8s)]
*  We're for the President. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=158.8s)]
*  And none of this is based in reality. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=159.8s)]
*  So Mr. Secretary, I guess I can conclude this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=161.88s)]
*  We know some bizarre situation with Michael Waltz happened with the first time the whole [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=164.12s)]
*  thing with the Signal app came out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=168.94s)]
*  You believe this came out, they said it was called Team Huddle, because one of the people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=170.72s)]
*  who worked for you, one of the three who no longer are there, leaked this out as a way [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=175.34s)]
*  to get back at you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=179.54s)]
*  That's right, Brian. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  When you dismiss people who you believe are leaking classified information, and again, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=183.7s)]
*  the investigation is ongoing and that will take time, and when the evidence produced, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=187.46s)]
*  it will go to DOJ, why would it surprise anybody, Brian, if those very same people keep leaking [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=191.26s)]
*  to the very same reporters, whatever information they think they can have to try to sabotage [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=197.34s)]
*  the agenda of the President or the Secretary. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=203.02s)]
*  So once a leaker, always a leaker, often a leaker. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  And so we looked for leakers because we take it very seriously. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=209.74s)]
*  And we will do the investigation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=212.98s)]
*  And if those people are exonerated, fantastic. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=213.98s)]
*  We don't think based on what we understand that it's going to be a good day for a number [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=217.62s)]
*  of those individuals because of what was found in the investigation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=221.18s)]
*  So if they want to keep leaking and pushing and peddling things to try to sabotage the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=224.62s)]
*  President's agenda, that's unfortunate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=228.74s)]
*  But that's how leaking works in this town. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=231.06s)]
*  We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI, on securing our southwest border, on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=233.54s)]
*  the President's agenda, and it's going very well at the Pentagon and I'm proud of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=238.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=242.18s)]
*  So the Signal app is what everyone uses. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=243.18s)]
*  We're all finding that out now because of the Chinese have infected and sabotaged, got [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=244.82s)]
*  every other communications apparatus over the last four years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=250.7s)]
*  So that's where you're communicating. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=255.22s)]
*  You say it took place, but there was no classified material in it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  Over the last few days, your senior advisor, Dan Caldwell, Darren Selnick, Colin Carroll, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=259.5s)]
*  who is Chief of Staff, Deputy Secretary of Defense, the other one, Darren is now former [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=264.86s)]
*  Deputy Chief of Staff, will let go. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=270.14s)]
*  Did you let them go? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=272.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=273.62s)]
*  It was a result of an investigation ongoing at the Pentagon where we identified there [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  was sufficient evidence, potentially, again, there's an investigation ongoing that will [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=279.62s)]
*  have to complete itself, sufficient evidence to believe that they or others near them were [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=284.14s)]
*  party to leaking. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=288.48s)]
*  And then I have a statutory responsibility, Brian, if I believe that's the case, to ultimately [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=289.74s)]
*  ensure they're no longer have access to that and that the investigation commences. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=295.38s)]
*  There are a lot of ways to communicate in this building. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=300.0s)]
*  I do it every day. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=302.06s)]
*  I was just doing it this morning. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=303.06s)]
*  There are real channels by which we communicate classified information. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=304.5s)]
*  If you want to do it and do it the right way, you should. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=307.42s)]
*  If we think you are leaking to the press, that's a very real problem. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=310.38s)]
*  We take that very seriously at the Pentagon. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=314.1s)]
*  I'm here to do one job. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=316.74s)]
*  One job for the president and the American people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=318.54s)]
*  Secure the country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=320.9s)]
*  America first. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=322.1s)]
*  Peace through strength. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=323.1s)]
*  I don't have time for leakers. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=324.1s)]
*  I don't have time for the hoax press that peddles old stories from disgruntled employees. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=325.1s)]
*  We should be talking about the decimation of the Houthis, how we're pushing back the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=330.74s)]
*  Chinese, how we have a new defense area at the southern border. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=333.86s)]
*  Instead, disgruntled former employees are peddling things to try to save their ass. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=337.18s)]
*  And ultimately, that's not going to work. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=342.38s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, did you find this out or did they come to you? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=345.14s)]
*  Because I know you know these guys. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=348.12s)]
*  These are the guys you picked, especially Caldwell. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=351.7s)]
*  And they worked for you for your previous job before you got over to Fox. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=355.1s)]
*  And they said that they have not been asked to have their phones. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=360.1s)]
*  They weren't asked about communications. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=362.34s)]
*  They didn't go through. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=363.9s)]
*  They didn't take a polygraph. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=366.02s)]
*  So why would they be let go and not be investigated? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=367.84s)]
*  Well, Brian, when there were a series of serious leaks at the Pentagon, which there were Panama [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=370.9s)]
*  Canal plans, Elon Musk's visit, you name it, any number of things, and there's four, five, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  six, seven things, we said enough is enough. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=383.73999999999995s)]
*  We're going to we're going to launch a leak investigation, which we did, which was then [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=386.58s)]
*  handed over to OSI, which is the Special Investigators here at DOD. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=390.82s)]
*  Through that investigation, information was surfaced, which created a responsibility to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=394.86s)]
*  take action. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=399.9s)]
*  That's how it works when you invest, when you actually investigate leaks, Brian. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=401.26s)]
*  So it's easy to say, oh, we asked everybody and everybody said they're good. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=405.14s)]
*  Or you can take it seriously and say, we don't think leaks are okay at this department. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=408.78s)]
*  So we're going to investigate. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=413.42s)]
*  And when we investigate, we'll take it anywhere it leads. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=414.86s)]
*  And unfortunately, Brian, to your point. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=417.86s)]
*  And again, if one or two of these guys is exonerated after an investigation, great. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=420.1s)]
*  That's what investigations are for. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=425.3s)]
*  But we took it seriously. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=427.18s)]
*  It led to some unfortunate places, people I have known for quite some time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=428.86s)]
*  But it's not my job to protect them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=432.74s)]
*  It's my job to protect national security, the president of the United States, and let [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=434.58s)]
*  the investigation go where it is. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=438.86s)]
*  So when that evidence is gathered sufficiently, and this has all happened very quickly, it [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=440.46s)]
*  will be handed over to DOJ and those people will be prosecuted if necessary. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=444.5s)]
*  The leakers know who they are. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=449.06s)]
*  And we know over time the truth will be told. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=450.97999999999996s)]
*  And we stand firm behind that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=453.74s)]
*  Leaking is not okay in national security policy. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=455.62s)]
*  And we will stand behind that every day of the week. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=458.74s)]
*  It looks like Carolyn Selnick intends to sue for wrongful termination. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  And again, they didn't ask to take a polygraph test. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=464.06s)]
*  Do you know Joe Casper? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=465.85999999999996s)]
*  Is he still your chief of staff? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=467.5s)]
*  Is he leaving? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=468.74s)]
*  Joe's a great guy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=469.74s)]
*  He's a great American. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=470.74s)]
*  He has done a fantastic job for us at the Defense Department, securing the southwest [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=472.18s)]
*  border, getting a beachhead here at the Pentagon. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=477.9s)]
*  He's staying with us, going to be in a slightly different role. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=480.14s)]
*  But he's not going anywhere. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=483.46s)]
*  He's certainly not fired. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=484.62s)]
*  You make changes over time. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=486.7s)]
*  And we're grateful for everything Joe's done. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=488.62s)]
*  So as you know, one of the people that left, he says he was not fired, he let go. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=490.78s)]
*  Other people said he was fired. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=495.38s)]
*  John Hewlett, a former Pentagon spokesperson, decided to put this in Politico and say, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=496.38s)]
*  here's a quote, it's been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon from leaks of sensitive [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=501.09999999999997s)]
*  operational plans to mass firings. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=504.78s)]
*  The dysfunctional now, a major distraction for the president, deserves better from his [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  senior leadership. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=511.17999999999995s)]
*  President Donald Trump has a strong record on holding his top officials to account. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=512.62s)]
*  Given that, it's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hicks that's remaining in his role for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=516.1s)]
*  much longer. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=520.3s)]
*  Do you know him? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=521.3s)]
*  I know he was let go. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=523.3399999999999s)]
*  He had a great idea to get rid of Jackie Robinson being sarcastic from the Pentagon. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=524.3399999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts about that statement? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=529.54s)]
*  Anybody that knows John knows why we let him go. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=532.62s)]
*  We did a lot of favors for John. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=536.34s)]
*  He did some good work up front. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=537.9s)]
*  Then he was moved along and asked to move along. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=539.86s)]
*  Now he's misrepresented a lot of things in the press. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=542.82s)]
*  It's unfortunate. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=545.22s)]
*  We did write by him. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=546.22s)]
*  We tried to help. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=547.42s)]
*  He's spinning it otherwise. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=548.82s)]
*  It's too bad. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=549.82s)]
*  It's politics, I guess. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=550.82s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, do you think you take this job, you come in with war experience and your [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=552.46s)]
*  great background. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=557.74s)]
*  Do you think there's a lot of people don't want you there and there's some type of steep [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=558.82s)]
*  deep state forces that want to make sure you don't stay there? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=563.62s)]
*  They've come after me from day one, just like they've come after President Trump. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=568.94s)]
*  I mean, I've gotten a fraction of what President Trump got in that first term. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=572.78s)]
*  What he's endured is superhuman. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=576.9s)]
*  It's not hard for me to do this job. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=578.9s)]
*  I know exactly why I'm here. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=580.86s)]
*  To bring war fighting and the war fighting ethos back to the Pentagon. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=583.22s)]
*  To rip out the insidious ideologies and not compromise and not back down. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=586.5s)]
*  To bring in new press voices into the Pentagon, which we've done. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=592.26s)]
*  To reestablish standards and accountability. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=595.7s)]
*  To not tolerate leakers. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=598.42s)]
*  To 100% operational control of our border. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=600.34s)]
*  To get rid of trans lunacy in the military. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=603.46s)]
*  We haven't backed down. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=606.7s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=607.7s)]
*  A lot of people come to Washington and they just play the game. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=608.7s)]
*  And it's you punch their ticket and get along to go along. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=612.5s)]
*  Start doing Meet the Press and going to the Council on Foreign Relations and spending [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=616.3s)]
*  time with all the new cocktail-sipping crowd. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=620.3s)]
*  That's not why I'm here. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=623.3s)]
*  I'm here because President Trump asked me to bring war fighting back to the Pentagon [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=624.3s)]
*  every single day. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=629.22s)]
*  That is our focus. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=631.04s)]
*  And if people don't like it, they can come after me. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=632.04s)]
*  No worries. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=635.14s)]
*  I'm standing right here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=636.14s)]
*  The war fighters are behind us. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=637.24s)]
*  Our enemies know they're on notice. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  Our allies know we're behind them. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=640.4399999999999s)]
*  And that, in this dangerous world, for the American people, is what it's all about. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=642.5400000000001s)]
*  I've been on two bases over the last two months. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=646.74s)]
*  They're overwhelmingly, anecdotally, support for you. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=649.4200000000001s)]
*  And they talked about recruiting going up. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=652.58s)]
*  So I asked for official numbers. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=654.02s)]
*  They are through the roof. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=655.98s)]
*  Take a look at these numbers with the Army, Air Force, and Marines. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=657.1800000000001s)]
*  You are up 108% in November, 119% in February. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=661.22s)]
*  108% after the election, 105% with the Navy. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=666.26s)]
*  With the Marines up 112% and 100%, they are through the roof. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=670.2s)]
*  The U.S. Air Force, 100% of its goal, same thing in February. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=675.84s)]
*  And Space Force is also booming, over 100%. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=681.36s)]
*  I think the war fighters are happy to have a war fighter up top. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=685.36s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, with all this controversy, everything's swirling around. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=689.0s)]
*  Have you ever doubted your decision to take this job? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=692.72s)]
*  Oh, not for a minute. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  I didn't hesitate when the president asked me, and I haven't hesitated for a moment, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=697.4s)]
*  because those numbers are a reflection of why we're here. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=701.24s)]
*  We call it the Trump bump internally. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  The reality is, when war fighting and lethality is brought back and it's serious, what we're [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=706.0s)]
*  doing here is serious about getting after soldiering and war fighting, American people [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  want to come back in. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=717.28s)]
*  They want to sign up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=718.36s)]
*  These recruiting numbers don't surprise me. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=719.64s)]
*  They don't surprise me one bit. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=721.12s)]
*  They're a reflection of a yearning from the American public of young people to be proud [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=722.88s)]
*  of their country, to be proud of their military, to make sure when they serve, they're given [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=728.4s)]
*  everything they need. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=732.12s)]
*  That's why I've fought for the budget that the Defense Department requires. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=733.12s)]
*  And the president said, we'll have our first trillion-dollar budget, because my kids, my [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=737.64s)]
*  14-year-old, if he joins, he's going to have a great military. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=742.08s)]
*  He's going to have peace through strength because of the historic investments of this [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=745.88s)]
*  president. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=749.84s)]
*  I haven't blinked, and I won't blink, because this job is too big and too important for [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=750.84s)]
*  the American people, and I'm grateful for every opportunity the president has given [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=756.44s)]
*  them. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=759.84s)]
*  And I was grateful to see the Hegseth Army on the Easter egg roll yesterday in the backdrop. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=760.84s)]
*  They are ready to go. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=766.08s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for your time today, and best of luck. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=767.08s)]
*  The world is not an easy place to control, and you're trying to do it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDVzWIj77Y&t=773.52s)]
