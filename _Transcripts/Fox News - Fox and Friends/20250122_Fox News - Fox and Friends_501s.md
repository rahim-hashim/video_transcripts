# Trump urges 'woke' bishop to apologize after viral tirade: 'Hard line Trump hater'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY)
*  Yesterday, the presidential party and members of Congress and whatnot, the Hoi Ploi of Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=0.0s)]
*  for the most part, went up to Washington's National Cathedral for the national prayer [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=6.44s)]
*  event. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=10.96s)]
*  And there at the lectern was Bishop Marianne Edgar Boode, and she gave a sermon that, you [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=12.1s)]
*  know, it's described as a sermon, but really it was a lecture where she told the new president, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=20.48s)]
*  go easy on migrants and refugees and members of the LBGTQ community. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=26.72s)]
*  If you missed it, it's gotten a lot of support in some quarters and a lot of criticism. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=35.32s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=43.2s)]
*  I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=44.2s)]
*  We're scared now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in democratic, republican and independent [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=54.66s)]
*  families, some who fear for their lives. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=62.459999999999994s)]
*  And the people, the people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, who labor [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=68.34s)]
*  in poultry farms and meatpacking plants, who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=74.74s)]
*  in hospitals, they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=81.46s)]
*  majority of immigrants are not criminals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=90.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=93.05999999999999s)]
*  It's always good to learn. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Was that John or was that Paul? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=96.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=98.41999999999999s)]
*  She didn't go through scripture. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=100.66s)]
*  She gave a political speech. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=101.66s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=103.13999999999999s)]
*  If someone that comes from generations of preachers, I would have walked out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=104.13999999999999s)]
*  I commend the president for being graceful, but I'm JD Vance. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=107.02s)]
*  I'm looking crazy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=110.42s)]
*  Like what is she talking about during a sermon? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=111.42s)]
*  I don't think it was appropriate time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  If you had something to say to the president that may be a little political, if you wanted [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  to talk about the president exercising mercy, then you could have asked for the president [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=120.58s)]
*  for a few minutes of his time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=125.42s)]
*  And said, Mr. President, this is the issue that I feel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=126.7s)]
*  But don't get up there and try to preach a sermon that you cite no scripture for. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=129.7s)]
*  Well she's not going to talk to him because during the George Floyd riots back in 2020, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=134.58s)]
*  she said she'd given up trying to speak to Trump and said that he needed to be replaced. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=139.86s)]
*  So you know. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=145.9s)]
*  Look at the children. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=146.9s)]
*  There's children there too that are hearing this message. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=147.9s)]
*  Well here's the thing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  You know, the president's team should have known that she could have said things that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=151.10000000000002s)]
*  were inappropriate for, or you know, stuff that they didn't need to hear or was not appropriate. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=155.86s)]
*  Just gulgur. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=161.5s)]
*  That's all they would have to do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  But instead they put him in that position where he's in the front row. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Why was she selected? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  Is she the director? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  Of that bishop. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=169.98s)]
*  Of that particular national cathedral. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=170.98s)]
*  Here she is last night on CNN explaining what she wanted to do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=173.66s)]
*  I was speaking to the president because I felt that he has this moment now where he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=177.5s)]
*  feels charged and empowered to do what he feels called to do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  And I wanted to say, you know, there is room for mercy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=189.06s)]
*  There's room for a broader compassion. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=194.42s)]
*  We don't need to portray with a broad cloth in the harshest of terms some of the most [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=197.3s)]
*  vulnerable people in our society. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=204.46s)]
*  So Trump wants an apology. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=207.18s)]
*  And he made that clear. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  He said the so-called bishop who spoke at the National Prayer Service on Tuesday morning [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  was a radical left hardline Trump hater. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=214.06s)]
*  She brought her church into the world of politics in a very ungracious way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  She was nasty in tone and not compelling or smart. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=220.74s)]
*  She failed to mention the large number of illegal immigrants. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  They came into our country and killed people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=226.5s)]
*  Many were deposited from jails and mental institutions. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=229.26s)]
*  It's a giant crime wave that is taking part in the USA. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=233.5s)]
*  Apart from her inappropriate statements, the service was very boring and uninspiring. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=236.22s)]
*  She is not very good at her job. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=241.02s)]
*  She and her church owe the public an apology. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=242.98s)]
*  You know, you've got this historic moment and she decides to give a lecture. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=245.06s)]
*  A self-important person who probably had AOC jot some notes down before. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=248.38s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=252.18s)]
*  I mean, she has every right to her opinion. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=253.18s)]
*  We all have an opinion on this issue. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=255.18s)]
*  But I don't like it when ministers bring politics into the pulpit and try to lecture you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=257.46s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=262.32s)]
*  Maybe pull them aside after the service and say, Mr. President, may I talk to you for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=263.54s)]
*  a little bit? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=267.22s)]
*  There's something in my community that bothers me and I or that I need to tell you about [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=268.22s)]
*  and just have an adult conversation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=273.58s)]
*  But do it privately because now everyone's talking about this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=275.52s)]
*  The issue that she's asking for mercy on when it comes to the border, did you go and speak [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=278.94s)]
*  to any of the families that were killed by illegals? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=283.1s)]
*  How about coming into New York and talking to the cops that had fire shot at them? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=285.5s)]
*  Did you ask for mercy for the cops? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=290.54s)]
*  I mean, that's why you don't get involved in this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=292.34s)]
*  She could have said, let's bring the country together. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=295.18s)]
*  Let's have the spirit of Christ. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=298.46s)]
*  But she went into some political radical leftist. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=300.46s)]
*  I don't know that church. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=303.78s)]
*  I don't know the structure. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=304.94s)]
*  But whoever is in command should have a look at this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=307.0s)]
*  This is not biblical doctrine that she's speaking from the pulpit. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  What denomination is this? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=313.7s)]
*  I think Episcopalian. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=315.5s)]
*  I think. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=317.5s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=318.5s)]
*  If she's going to be the bishop and she's going to lecture the president every time [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=320.82s)]
*  he goes to events like that, maybe it's time for the president and Washington in general [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=325.5s)]
*  to stop going to the National Cathedral. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=330.82s)]
*  I'm for that too. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  Not far from the White House is St. Matthew's, where we baptize my son Peter, or go to the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=334.58s)]
*  Basilica at Catholic University. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=341.86s)]
*  It's referred to as America's Catholic Church. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=343.9s)]
*  I doubt that they would ever make anything political. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=346.5s)]
*  And if you remember at the inaugural, who gave one of the opening prayers? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=349.38s)]
*  Cardinal Dolan. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=355.02s)]
*  Was he political? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=356.34s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=357.34s)]
*  He was looking to the future. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  So just don't go back. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=359.82s)]
*  Donald Trump said he's non-denominational now. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=362.66s)]
*  So go to a non-denominational church. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=365.38s)]
*  You're not going to get a lecture like that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=366.62s)]
*  Well, put it this way. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=367.94s)]
*  Why doesn't he just say, if you don't get rid of her or change your tone, if the president [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=368.94s)]
*  of the United States decides not to go to the National Cathedral, that would be Titanic [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=374.62s)]
*  news. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=378.18s)]
*  It would be. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=379.18s)]
*  And it would really put pressure on her to start doing the whole bishop thing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=380.18s)]
*  I don't know what form she filled out and how many interviews she went through, but [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=382.58s)]
*  do you realize for her to get that job and to do that mass, how many people had to sign [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=386.94s)]
*  off on it? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=392.70000000000005s)]
*  So it wasn't just like, it's not like she's like, oh, I was just a hole in a schedule. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=393.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm filling in for somebody. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=396.42s)]
*  She's had that job for a while. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=397.42s)]
*  To your point, Ainsley, she is absolutely protected by the First Amendment. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=399.62s)]
*  And she can say anything she wants, but just, you know, the Trump team probably should have [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=403.22s)]
*  looked a little into her background. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=407.3s)]
*  Is she going to go ahead and sandbag him? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=409.42s)]
*  But she was supposed to be representing the great book. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=412.26000000000005s)]
*  OK? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=414.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=415.74s)]
*  And nothing that she said there was representative of that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=416.74s)]
*  She's saying mercy, but there's nothing about obeying the laws of the land. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=420.22s)]
*  I think people who have her opinion are reading the whole border situation in the wrong way. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=424.58000000000004s)]
*  It's not that he doesn't have compassion. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=430.54s)]
*  Of course he has compassion on every single person. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=432.1s)]
*  Everyone's God's child. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=434.46000000000004s)]
*  It's not about that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=435.82000000000005s)]
*  It's about taxpayers paying so much for other people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=436.82000000000005s)]
*  We're pouring into the tax base and they're giving that money to people who are not here [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  legally and are not contributing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=444.98s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=446.82000000000005s)]
*  And the crime, the people that are murdering Lake and Riley. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=447.82s)]
*  Yes, you're right. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  She should have a conversation with their parents and have mercy on those families. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  Which just passed Lake and Riley, though. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=456.38s)]
*  Lake and Riley build and had over 40 votes in the House alone. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=458.5s)]
*  Right, goes back to the House today. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=461.94s)]
*  She wants to be famous. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=463.46s)]
*  That's why she opts on CNN. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=464.46s)]
*  That's why she sat there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  There's video of her in 2020 with her ridiculous mask on, outdoors, with the little vent on [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  the side, screaming about Donald Trump and what he should be, and the George Floyd riots. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=475.02s)]
*  That's not somebody that wants to be a leader for everybody. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=481.9s)]
*  No, she shouldn't be in clergy. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=484.06s)]
*  Okay, so that's something a lot of people on both sides are talking about today. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIVrleuajY&t=485.74s)]
