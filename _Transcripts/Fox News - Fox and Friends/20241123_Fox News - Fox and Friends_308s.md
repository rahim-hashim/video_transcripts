# Dems are ‘working overtime’ to push their agenda before Trump transition
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk)
*  President Biden and Senate Democrats are trying to push through judicial nominees before leaving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=0.0s)]
*  the White House, while the GOP faces criticism for several vote absences that could have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=4.9s)]
*  blocked those judicial picks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=10.86s)]
*  Senator Chuck Grassley slamming his fellow lawmakers telling Fox News, quote, Senate [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=14.34s)]
*  Republicans must do everything they can to stop this lame duck conveyor belt of radicals. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=18.46s)]
*  But Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn was present this week for those crucial votes, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  and she joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=29.28s)]
*  Thank you for joining us, Senator Blackburn. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=30.68s)]
*  What do you have to say to your fellow Republicans about missing these crucial votes? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=33.08s)]
*  You know, Charlie, one of the things we have to realize is that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=41.38s)]
*  have learned absolutely nothing in this election cycle, and they are going to be working overtime [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  to try to push forward their agenda because they've lost the House, the Senate and the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=53.96s)]
*  White House. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=59.28s)]
*  And so we're going to have to walk and chew gum at the same time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=60.42s)]
*  And we've had some wins in blocking some of these judges for the circuit courts. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=64.2s)]
*  And we're also going to have to make certain that on day one, Donald Trump is going to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=71.08s)]
*  have cabinet members approved and getting to work. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=78.64s)]
*  And we're going to have to give him a lot of clear runway to get his agenda through. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=83.64s)]
*  That first hundred days is going to be vitally important. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=89.56s)]
*  And we are so excited about turning our attention to 2025. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=94.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  And you're so right that Democrats are taking this opportunity. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=100.32s)]
*  It's kind of like a smash and grab operation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=104.02s)]
*  But all the more important and obviously some of those Republicans that have missed these [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=106.8s)]
*  things are J.D. Vance, who is busy being the vice president-elect, and Marco Rubio, who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=109.88s)]
*  is busy being secretary of state nominee for secretary of state. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=116.48s)]
*  But what can be done to make Republicans in the Senate realize what you understand, which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=122.48s)]
*  is this is still a very important time when Democrats have nothing left to lose and they're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=130.86s)]
*  going to do all they can to jam a bunch of radicals onto the courts for lifetime appointments. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=136.6s)]
*  And we had everybody show up finally. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course, everyone is going to work to block these bad nominees. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=148.56s)]
*  And we had a judiciary committee meeting this past Thursday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=154.94s)]
*  And Charlie, as you well know, what they're trying to do is push up their nominees. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=160.0s)]
*  And we are going to do everything we can to block them, to hold them, to make certain [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=166.4s)]
*  that we don't get those, that they aren't able to get some of those votes that they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=171.4s)]
*  are wanting to get. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=176.0s)]
*  We will go back the first week of December. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=177.76s)]
*  We will be there until December 20. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=180.88s)]
*  And in that period of time, they're going to have spending measures that are going to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=184.64s)]
*  be on the floor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=190.48s)]
*  And as I said, whether it is nominees they're trying to put in place or people that they're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=192.12s)]
*  trying to stuff into the administration or money that they're trying to obligate before [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=198.5s)]
*  Donald Trump takes office, our job is going to be to stop as much bad stuff because, as [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=205.12s)]
*  I said, they have learned nothing and give Donald Trump the clear runway he needs so [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=212.9s)]
*  that we have an amazing first hundred days in 2025 with the Donald Trump administration. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  So of course, you'll be extra busy because you've also been named vice chair of the NRSC [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=226.3s)]
*  for the 26th cycle. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=230.9s)]
*  How are you feeling about how that's shaping up? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=232.74s)]
*  I feel very good about that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=236.5s)]
*  Tim Scott and I have put a lot of effort into looking at how the NRSC would be shaped. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=238.34s)]
*  As you know, that's the committee that tends to our senators and their reelections. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to be working on incumbent retention for those 20 Republican senators that are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=249.94s)]
*  up. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=257.3s)]
*  And Charlie, we're already focused looking at what is happening with their communication [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=258.3s)]
*  plans, their campaign plans, their fundraising plans to make certain that for those 20, those [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=263.14s)]
*  incumbent Republicans, plus the open seats that we will have in Ohio and Florida, that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=271.14s)]
*  we are getting to work taking nothing for granted and making certain our incumbents [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=278.5s)]
*  win and that Donald Trump will have a strong Senate majority all four years of his administration. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=285.7s)]
*  Well, you'll be busy and we'll be watching. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=292.18s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Blackburn. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=295.14s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=297.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrY0llx0uk&t=298.41999999999996s)]
