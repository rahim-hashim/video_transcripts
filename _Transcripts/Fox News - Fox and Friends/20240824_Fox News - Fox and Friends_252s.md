# DEI is patently illegal: Charles Gasparino
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM)
*  The parent company of Jack Daniels is ending their corporate DEI initiatives, which they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=0.0s)]
*  say was due to the quote, changing business landscape. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=9.5s)]
*  There's more to it than that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=13.02s)]
*  Brown Foreman, they're the parent company, now joins several major companies who have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=15.36s)]
*  ditched woke ideology in DEI recently. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=19.54s)]
*  Our next guest wrote the book on the impact of DEI on corporate America. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=23.42s)]
*  Go woke, go broke. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=27.5s)]
*  The author of that book is Fox Business correspondent, Charles Gasparino. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=28.84s)]
*  Charles, great to see you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=33.12s)]
*  Does it surprise you that yet another great American brand is deciding to say this whole [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=34.88s)]
*  DEI thing driven by our HR department, which segregates people by their race, is not working [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=40.2s)]
*  for us? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=45.64s)]
*  What changed? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=46.64s)]
*  It's patently illegal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=48.84s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the problems that they have. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, let's be real clear here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=52.84s)]
*  The notion of forced diversity based on race in employment has always been suspect. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=55.84s)]
*  Now, there are civil rights laws that say you can't discriminate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=62.88s)]
*  There's Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which says you can't discriminate based on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=67.16s)]
*  race. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  But DEI takes it a lot further. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=72.04s)]
*  It basically sets these rigid standards, which essentially violates Title VII. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=74.4s)]
*  Now, once the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action and essentially DEI on college campuses, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  that it's illegal, I think they based that on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=85.96s)]
*  It's Title VI is basically written the same as Title VII, which covers employment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=90.6s)]
*  So these things are problematic. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  And what I show in the book is that companies, and this is the sort of last part of the book, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=97.0s)]
*  companies went sort of nuts on DEI following the George Floyd killing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=101.64s)]
*  It was very rigid. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=107.2s)]
*  It went from the very top, the board members, all the way down to suppliers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=108.7s)]
*  After that, there's been sort of a consumer and a public backlash against it because it's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=114.52s)]
*  patently unfair. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=119.6s)]
*  And the minute the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action is when you saw companies [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  starting to unwind this stuff, particularly as it applies to employment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=125.08s)]
*  It's not totally unwound. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=132.24s)]
*  I mean, one of the reasons why you had a trans woman in a bubble bath drinking Budweiser in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=133.24s)]
*  a commercial was because of DEI. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=139.28s)]
*  Now, they're not going there, meaning Budweiser and Anheuser-Busch, ABMVB anymore, not just [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=142.2s)]
*  because of legality. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=147.68s)]
*  People stop buying the beer, as I point out in the book. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=149.2s)]
*  So it's really a loser on every level. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=152.92s)]
*  So it's really bad for the bottom line. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=155.72s)]
*  But ultimately, these businesses are opening themselves up to litigation from their own [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=157.08s)]
*  employees who feel like they may be left behind or passed over because of some DEI initiative. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=161.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=167.0s)]
*  As I show in the book, they essentially right after that ruling, that affirmative action [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=168.0s)]
*  ruling, really smart companies started taking the initiative because they realized a couple [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=173.2s)]
*  things. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=177.84s)]
*  DEI departments were out of control. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=178.84s)]
*  They were answering to nobody. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=180.84s)]
*  Like most departments, we report to somebody who reports to somebody who reports to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=182.12s)]
*  general counsel and the CEO of Fox. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=187.96s)]
*  There was none of that oversight on these DEI departments as they found out. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=191.96s)]
*  And that's why they went off the rails. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=196.0s)]
*  And then they recognized it was possibly, probably, definitely, I should say, illegal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=198.68s)]
*  And that's when you saw the companies start to scrub from their websites. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=204.52s)]
*  Just the language started to change. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=208.96s)]
*  It wasn't just, we will do X, Y, and Z. We will open up to everybody, became more inclusive. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=210.76s)]
*  In any event, as the book points out, it's a loser from a consumer standpoint. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=216.24s)]
*  It's going to be, if you go there, a loser in courts because the Supreme Court has ruled [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=222.0s)]
*  you cannot discriminate blatantly. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=226.92s)]
*  And DEI is blatant discrimination. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=229.12s)]
*  Well, the book is Go Woke, Go Broke. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=232.48s)]
*  It lays out how this all happened. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=233.48s)]
*  By the way, Fox and Friends reached out to Brown Foreman and we have not heard back. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=235.64s)]
*  Charles, thanks so much for your time. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Have a great Saturday. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FGFi0jkVM&t=240.07999999999998s)]
