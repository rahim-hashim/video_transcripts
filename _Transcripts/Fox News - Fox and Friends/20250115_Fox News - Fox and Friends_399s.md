# Tech CEOs to show up in support of Trump on Inauguration Day
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM)
*  And we are just five days out from the inauguration and Silicon Valley is now showing its support for Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=0.0s)]
*  With a number of big tech leaders expected to be on hand up close for the swearing-in ceremony [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=5.88s)]
*  Back in the stands, but former first lady Michelle Obama will not be there Alexis McAdams joins us live from West Palm Beach [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=12.92s)]
*  With the latest. Hey Alexis [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=19.48s)]
*  Hey, good morning. Yeah, we haven't heard a reason why Michelle Obama is skipping Trump's inauguration [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=21.8s)]
*  We're waiting to find out why she's not coming to this big large event on top of it [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=26.52s)]
*  But hey, she won't be there [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=30.32s)]
*  but big tech tie and tech tech Titans rather will be there and they're gonna be front and center because they want everybody to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  See these new relationships Trump has as they all try to get into a circle or at least they think they're in it [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Take a look here. Okay. This is who's in so far. We know it's a Zuckerberg there Elon Musk [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=41.92s)]
*  Bezos and Sam Altman all be sitting together at the inauguration. That's the chief executives of Tesla [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=47.44s)]
*  Amazon open AI and Meta up on the platform and that's a big deal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  That's an important place to sit because that's where Trump's cabinet and elected officials all sit this year former first lady Michelle Obama [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  Skipping this but she has not given a reason yet [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  The Obama spokesperson says former president Barack Obama is confirmed Michelle Obama also just missed President Jimmy Carter's funeral [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=66.12s)]
*  Which a lot of people were talking about that too. This comes as president-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=73.84s)]
*  He's gonna create an external revenue office upon his return to the White House to collect all foreign source revenue such as tariffs [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  Okay, he says for far too long [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=86.92s)]
*  We've relied on taxing our great people using the IRS through soft and pathetically weak trade agreements [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=88.72s)]
*  The American economy has delivered growth and prosperity in the world while taxing ourselves [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=95.84s)]
*  So I think people at home are interested in hearing more about instead of ditching the IRS how they're gonna take tariffs from these other [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Nations back out here live the World Economic Forum [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=107.0s)]
*  Okay is gonna be going on in Davos, Switzerland around the same time that Trump is gonna be at the inauguration [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=109.2s)]
*  But it's important to point out that some of those big tech names and also finance guys are not gonna be over in Davos [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna either be here in Palm Beach like they've been trying to meet with Trump and then going to the inauguration [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=120.04s)]
*  So it kind of shows you a shift of world power there back to you. Thanks so much. Yeah. Thanks so much Alexis [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=124.28s)]
*  So it's gonna be fascinating because he won must Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Altman does not talk to Elon Musk had this huge fallout [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=133.72s)]
*  They're suing each other Bezos and Musk are in a death match for who's gonna get in the sky first [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=136.32s)]
*  Obviously Musk is winning big and Zuckerberg and Musk. We're gonna have that fight in the octagon [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=140.88s)]
*  So they're all gonna be sitting together [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=145.44s)]
*  They say at least ten of Trump's picks for key administration roles have professional ties either [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=147.0s)]
*  Andreessen Musk or teal and I think it's gonna be fascinating. My hope is these guys are so bright [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  We want to win the AI race [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  We also want Silicon Valley to work with the Pentagon to give us the most lethal weapons the most affordable weapons possible [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=159.18s)]
*  And for the longest time hey that Google knows we're keeping an arm's length in the Pentagon and ethical reasons [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=166.74s)]
*  You know the guys with the nose rings in the purple hair don't want to be a part of it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  That's changed and and there's a hope that the Pentagon is gonna interface [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=176.18s)]
*  With and I know that Senator wicker feels the same way [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=180.66s)]
*  With Silicon Valley and the AI guys and and these and these bros and they're gonna start moving us forward [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Rapidly and leaning out. My also hope is that these guys are doing it for patriotic reasons because they're so smart [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=190.2s)]
*  They're so bright and they they're got to be lethal to be successful. This has got to be patriotism [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=196.44s)]
*  What I want don't tell me you're gonna benefit personally by being in government because you know, you're not doing for the paycheck [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=202.0s)]
*  Well think about eight years ago [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=208.16s)]
*  Big tech did not want Donald Trump to win four years ago big tech did not want Donald Trump to win [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=210.16s)]
*  He won now they realize you know what? It's better to be at the table than being shot [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=217.52s)]
*  I think it goes back to the economy and one one executive said I don't know anyone who's gonna be at Davos this year [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=222.96s)]
*  Yeah, because they're all gonna be up there at the inauguration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=229.26s)]
*  I know that Laura Bush and George Bush are gonna be there Barack Obama will be there without Michelle and Hillary and Bill will be there [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=231.88s)]
*  She's not going she did she skipped Jimmy Carter's funeral because she had an extended trip in Hawaii scheduling problem [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  Exactly speaker Johnson said the flag, you know, the flag is flown at half-staff force [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  For President Carter for 30 days [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=251.28s)]
*  But he said for one day on inauguration day to show a sign of unity for our country doing the same thing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=253.68s)]
*  Our flag is back up for that day and there's some other states. I think Florida is following and soon [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=260.72s)]
*  I'm sure our state will to you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=265.72s)]
*  Honestly don't care about Michelle Obama the goinger [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=268.32000000000005s)]
*  Deciding to stay home. The only thing that annoys me a little bit [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  she was the one who preached about unity and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=275.16s)]
*  Norms and standards go when they go low you go high it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=278.8s)]
*  It only appears that she only does that when she wins and it's okay be this way [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=282.48s)]
*  But don't try to pretend like you're high and mighty [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  And that's not thinking it. I'm not pretending because you heard what I said about Donald Trump at the DNC [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=290.48s)]
*  Doesn't like him and protocol wise she would have been sitting right where Barack Obama was at the Carter funeral [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=296.26000000000005s)]
*  She would have been right next to Donald Trump and given the fact that she said Donald Trump was unfit [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  She's decided you know what? I'm just not gonna go she's disrespecting the the the transition of power [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=307.66s)]
*  The whole point was when she said on the campaign trail when all the presidents got [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  Together when Donald Trump then show up for the inauguration of Joe Biden that they were coming together the show [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=317.42s)]
*  Unity whether they disagree with the people or not and she's deciding not to do that. So [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=323.26s)]
*  Yeah, why and just to wrap up the tech thing? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=329.58s)]
*  One of the reasons too is Joe Biden's people were so oppressive and so dominating on AI [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=332.06s)]
*  They were putting up these barriers and these [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=337.26s)]
*  guideline guardrails [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  They were choking it and they said and then you heard Zuckerberg say they were getting [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=341.94s)]
*  Threatened with taking down and and you better take this down. You better shadow ban these people [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=346.41999999999996s)]
*  They don't want any part of it they have by by their oppressive thuggish behavior [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=350.92s)]
*  They have actually pushed the most successful people in this country towards a party [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=355.6s)]
*  They previously wanted nothing to do with can thank you Joe Biden [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=360.44s)]
*  Well and because they have been at such an arm's length away from Donald Trump and Donald Trump has railed against big tech for a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  Long time the irony is I read this morning that Elon Musk is actually going to have an office [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=370.44s)]
*  Given the fact that he's part of Doge at the White House [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=376.64s)]
*  It's gonna be in the Eisenhower building which is right next door, but Elon Musk will have an office at the White House [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45xHnYttcM&t=379.88s)]
