# Dozens STILL missing in Texas floods, Coast Guard issues new update #shorts #foxnews #breakingnews
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrG6C3MqU)
*  How is the Coast Guard responding to this flood in Texas right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrG6C3MqU&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. Yeah, so primarily we're using our helicopter assets. So the MH-65 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrG6C3MqU&t=3.68s)]
*  Echo is primarily a maritime search and rescue asset, so we're used to going offshore. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrG6C3MqU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  But right now we're using it for inland search and rescue. So operating using our hoist capability [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrG6C3MqU&t=17.68s)]
*  or just landing and picking people up and transiting them in the MH-65 Dolphin. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrG6C3MqU&t=26.0s)]
