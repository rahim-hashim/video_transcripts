# This would be a ‘very bad move’ for Kathy Hochul, NY attorney warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU)
*  The DOJ now moving to dismiss corruption charges brought against New York City Mayor Eric Adams [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=0.0s)]
*  The mayor telling Fox and Friends yesterday that all claims of any immigration quid pro quo were false [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Think about my attorney Alex Spira wanted to wanted to top [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=13.48s)]
*  Trial attorneys in the country [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=18.76s)]
*  Imagine him going inside saying that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=21.52s)]
*  The only way [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=24.919999999999998s)]
*  Madams is going to assist in immigration, which I was calling for for since 2022 is if you drop the charges [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=26.2s)]
*  That's quid pro quo. That's a crime that it took three [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=33.44s)]
*  She took it took up three weeks to report in front of her a criminal action. Come on. This is silly [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=35.76s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is Rebecca Rose Woodland a trial attorney based in New York. So great to see you Rebecca [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  So just to sort of bring everybody up to speed on this the the allegation the the theory is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=48.2s)]
*  that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=54.36s)]
*  DOJ agreed to drop charges against federal corruption charges against Eric Adams in exchange for him [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=55.96s)]
*  cooperating on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=64.48s)]
*  immigration enforcement [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=68.2s)]
*  So in exchange for Eric Adams doing his job [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=71.6s)]
*  Which is allowing the federal government and now President Trump who now runs this country coming in saying I don't want [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=75.08s)]
*  illegal immigrants in this country and I want to deport those who we choose who we find are criminals or [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  For whatever reason ICE decides should not be here. So [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=91.36s)]
*  You're telling me that President Donald Trump made a deal with Eric Adams [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  He's the mayor of a city the president of the United States had to beg him to do his job. It is ridiculous [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=102.04s)]
*  well [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=110.4s)]
*  But obviously there are a lot of cities run by a lot of mayors who are not doing their jobs [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=112.04s)]
*  And are are clearly working to to circumvent federal laws about immigration [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=117.76s)]
*  But let me ask you about this. So a bunch of federal prosecutors quit in response to all that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  What do you make about of their actions? Well, they quit were they the people who were bringing this sort of? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=128.2s)]
*  attempted what we call political [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Opposition mayor Adams claims he complained during Joe Biden's administration and then got hit with these indictments that he said were completely false [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=138.76s)]
*  Now was this the same warfare that was used against President Trump with? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=147.44s)]
*  Alvin Bragg Leticia James was this the same thing was the were these people? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=153.04s)]
*  Participating in a scheme like that and that's not where the Justice Department should be [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=159.16s)]
*  So one of the really crazy things about the story is that now governor Kathy Hockel has actually has the authority to remove [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=163.22s)]
*  Adams as mayor of New York City [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean what so what are the dynamics that go into her thinking right now on that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=173.58s)]
*  I mean, I don't I don't know her personally [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=178.74s)]
*  But I would think that that would be a very bad move for her. Eric Adams is doing his job [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=181.78s)]
*  He complained for years about the burdens this city was taking on with these illegal immigrants [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=188.22000000000003s)]
*  He complained to the administration before Donald Trump's administration and you're telling me now that she's going to remove him [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=195.3s)]
*  Why because Pam Bondi who happens to be a great friend of mine who I've known for years. She's an honest ethical [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=202.74s)]
*  DOJ that she's running a division in a department that is just doing their job if they reviewed the case and said there's nothing there [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, I could say this as a regular [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=218.02s)]
*  Taxpayer and American citizen that a deal to drop charges against Eric Adams in exchange for actually doing something about illegal immigration [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=221.3s)]
*  millions of illegals flooding in and not to mention tens of billions of dollars that we're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  That we're spending on this maybe not such a bad deal [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  Rebecca Rose Woodward Woodland. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=239.94000000000003s)]
*  You [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_IZ5LxbhU&t=247.86s)]
