# BREAKING: Arrests made after Tren de Aragua attack on NYC cops
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8)
*  Meanwhile police arrest in another teen who was allegedly part of a group that attacked two NYPD officers last week in Times Square [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=0.0s)]
*  and officials say that the suspects are members of Trended Agua, the gang. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=6.88s)]
*  Chanley Painter joins us now with all the details. Hey Chanley. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=11.28s)]
*  Hey Ansley, Lawrence and Brian. So police are still searching for more suspects after that assault of two NYPD officers in Times Square last week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=14.08s)]
*  Authorities say the suspects are members of a Times Square gang known as Diablo Stela 42 described as an offshoot of Trende Agua, the violent Venezuelan gang. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=22.32s)]
*  And the latest suspect arrested is only 16 years old. He faces 10 charges including attempted assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=32.32s)]
*  Police say the first five suspects arrested were all illegal migrants from Venezuela, all repeat offenders that were listed in the city's gang database. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=41.6s)]
*  Three others are still being sought. Police releasing these photos asking for the public's help in apprehending the suspects. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  And investigators say the migrant youth gang confronted their victims in the heart of Times Square last Friday then surrounded them in a quote wolf pack style robbery. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=59.36s)]
*  Police releasing this new body cam video of the attack showing the migrant crew throwing makeshift weapons at the officers who were attempting to break up the robbery. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  Thankfully none of them were seriously injured, the officers that is. And the alleged gang members though they range in age from 12 to 19 years old and are linked to dozens of robberies around New York City since 2022 guys according to police. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=78.96s)]
*  And Chandler, you're a lawyer. The problem is if they're under, if they're minors nothing changes. They're still going to get let out. So they have to take extraordinary action in order to keep them under lock and key. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  In South Carolina you'd go to Juve, you'd go to Juvenile. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=106.88s)]
*  Well they go out of their way to make sure, that's why TDA uses these guys, uses these kids to do a lot of this stuff as well as recruiting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=109.36s)]
*  I'm just curious to Brian's point because he's talking about the state of New York has these laws. Now that the president have declared TDA is a foreign terrorist organization, can the fed step in now and prosecute these folks since they're a part of a terrorist organization now? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=116.96s)]
*  Absolutely they should try that. It's a great point Lawrence and that's right that is why TDA is targeting Juvenile offenders because get this the police say that these minors have been involved in more than 200 crimes because they get arrested and then they're released and then they offend again and again and again. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=133.44000000000003s)]
*  Only one so far has been charged as an adult because he is 19 years old but this is a problem and the mayor is now stepping in. They're going to start cracking down on this activity guys. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=149.36s)]
*  Unbelievable thanks so much. Meanwhile we feed them, we give them clothes, they go back to our hotel rooms, do we give them? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  And they don't cooperate with ICE. There's a headline two days ago in the New York Post, ICE agents turned away from NYPD precinct where migrant teen was held after mob attack on the cops. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=165.28s)]
*  Can I just say one thing? I don't know if law enforcement will back me up on this but if you see two officers overwhelmed by dozens of others you have to jump in and help out the officers. 100%. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=175.36s)]
*  Come on, why are you standing with your back against the building? You can't do it all. Help them out. An officer definitely would appreciate it in a time like this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=185.76s)]
*  The problem is people are scared to step in because of what's happened to Daniel, Penny and others who have tried to step in and do the right thing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=193.36s)]
*  There were no cops around. I imagine a cop might have your back right next to him. You can't allow the criminals to win though. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  By the way it's underreported they still are having to do construction for these hotels that they completely destroyed. They're having to gut everything out of it because they just trashed all of these buildings. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  And remember Brian they were complaining because they didn't like the food. Our taxpayers were paying for them. So then we gave them money cards to go shopping for food. It was an experiment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=215.36s)]
*  And keep in mind the hotel owners don't feel bad for them. They got max money for those hotel rooms. That's why they said okay bring in your illegals, take it over, we'll do their sheets and give them a little mint on their pillow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg2HsWKP2o8&t=224.08s)]
