# Kamala Harris needs this debate more than Trump, expert warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris emerging from intense debate prep in Pittsburgh to visit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=0.0s)]
*  a local spice shop sharing what she wants to be the main takeaway when she faces former [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=5.4s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=11.16s)]
*  Well, there's a lot, but look, it's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=12.16s)]
*  It's time to bring our country together, chart a new way forward. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Our break comes after five days of quote, highly choreographed debate practice sessions [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=26.44s)]
*  reported to complete with a stage, a replica TV lighting and Donald Trump method actor. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  So here to react is Washington Examiner Deputy Editor of Restoring America, Kayleigh McGee [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=35.68s)]
*  White with us this morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=40.56s)]
*  Kayleigh, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=41.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, we were just talking about here in the show, the different [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=44.24s)]
*  challenges they have. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=48.96s)]
*  Hers will be living up to some expectations when it comes to substance. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Hers will be about style and how he approaches a female presidential candidate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=54.2s)]
*  How do you see the prep for both candidates? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think that it's clear Kamala Harris needs this debate more than Donald Trump. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=62.28s)]
*  And if that weren't the case, I don't think her team would have agreed to do it in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=67.72s)]
*  first place. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=71.16s)]
*  So that should tell you something about their internal polling. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=72.16s)]
*  But she needs this debate because she's failed to do two things so far. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  She's failed to prove how she's different from Joe Biden, and she's even failed to prove [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=78.44s)]
*  how she's different than Donald Trump to a certain extent, considering that the few [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=82.66s)]
*  policies she's released are also Trump policies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=86.38s)]
*  And she has two major problems going into this debate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=90.02s)]
*  And I actually think it's quite telling that her team is already setting the bar a bit [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=92.58s)]
*  low for her, saying that she's at a disadvantage. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=96.3s)]
*  I actually agree with them on that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  However, not because of the rules, as they've claimed, but because, as you guys know, when [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=101.1s)]
*  we're preparing for a panel with someone who's going to challenge us on our beliefs or when [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=105.58s)]
*  we're going to have to do the challenging, that's a sort of muscle that you have to exercise [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=110.02s)]
*  regularly to be good at. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=114.3s)]
*  When was the last time Kamala Harris was in a hostile environment taking challenging questions? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=116.34s)]
*  Probably back in 2019 when she was running for president the last time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=122.66s)]
*  She has not done this in four years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  And there's also the disadvantage for her that the longer that she's exposed to the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=129.52s)]
*  public, the more people dislike her. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=133.5s)]
*  Again, we saw this play out in 2019, and it seems to be playing out exactly again. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=135.98s)]
*  Well, that's why, because of that, I would have disagreed with you, Kayleigh, about she [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=140.66s)]
*  needs this debate more than Donald Trump. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=143.62s)]
*  I do think it's their strategy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=146.42s)]
*  It seems undeniable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=148.14s)]
*  And I don't think it's a dumb strategy to keep her away from everybody. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=150.33999999999997s)]
*  Just don't expose her. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  Don't expose her lack of spontaneity. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=155.14s)]
*  Don't expose her policies. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=157.56s)]
*  And so the debate is a moment where she's going to have to be exposed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=158.56s)]
*  So in a way, I think it's more important for Donald Trump, this debate, because I think [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=161.98s)]
*  she'd rather just stay hidden in this process. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=165.34s)]
*  But the polls are moving. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=167.9s)]
*  So that's why I'm starting to think maybe this becomes more important for her. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=169.02s)]
*  The polls are moving a bit and she's not the hide strategy doesn't seem to be working as [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=171.94s)]
*  good as it did before. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=176.02s)]
*  I want to ask you about this because we should highlight this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=177.78s)]
*  She was at a spice shop yesterday and she says the number one thing is to move beyond [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  divisiveness. But yet this spice shop, everyone looked at who is this spice shop in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  Pittsburgh. They've published Kayleigh like, hey, if you're a Republican, we're not [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=188.9s)]
*  interested in your business. Super like very divisive stuff on their on their website. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=193.7s)]
*  It's it's it's a fascinating place to all of a sudden go, I want to bring everybody [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=198.54s)]
*  together, just not over spices, I guess. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=202.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is this is the party of joy, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=206.94s)]
*  I can I can just feel it coming from this spice shop and from everyone else in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=209.06s)]
*  Democratic Party. And again, it just goes to show that they're completely hypocritical [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=212.54s)]
*  on their message. They got up at the DNC and they preached this message of unity. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=216.5s)]
*  And even Kamala is now saying that it's time to move forward. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=220.74s)]
*  And yet this is actually what they're projecting, that we're going to move forward unless [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=223.66s)]
*  you disagree with our viewpoint. And so, again, you know, this is actually, again, a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=227.74s)]
*  disadvantage for Kamala in that this is her only message. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  She has no policies to run on as of right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=234.66s)]
*  So she only has this message message of joy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=237.3s)]
*  And yet her own people are constantly undermining that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=240.02s)]
*  Well, Kayleigh brought up the rules of debate. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=243.34s)]
*  Pete and I are going to get into that a little bit later. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=245.58s)]
*  We'll go off the wall and talk to you about the different rules in the debate and how [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=247.02s)]
*  they can impact the outcome. A great conversation, though, Kayleigh. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaFKsG6nxWs&t=249.38s)]
