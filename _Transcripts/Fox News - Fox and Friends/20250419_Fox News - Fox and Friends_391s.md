# Wife of MS-13 suspect dodges abuse question: ‘That’s all I can say’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A)
*  Despite major backlash from a Democrat, Senator Chris Van Hollen is defending his trip to El Salvador with a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=0.0s)]
*  To meet with the suspected MS 13 gang member and this comes as DHS releases the investigative report that shows he was stopped on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=6.84s)]
*  suspicion of human trafficking back in 2022 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=14.64s)]
*  That's right. Madeline Rivera is live in Washington DC with all of that Maddie [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=18.44s)]
*  What's the latest on this human trafficking angle of this story? Hi guys. Good morning. That's right [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  This is coming from a Homeland Security investigations report and mentions a traffic stop for Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Tennessee back in December [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=29.32s)]
*  2022 police say Abrego Garcia was driving from Houston to Maryland with eight other people in the car [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Abrego Garcia told authorities they were going to do construction work [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=43.64s)]
*  But there was no luggage in the car and they all gave the same home address as Abrego Garcia and that led police to suspect [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  This was a human trafficking incident [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=53.36s)]
*  Abrego Garcia however was not charged the year before Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer had filed for a temporary protective order against him [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=55.68s)]
*  She alleged that he punched and scratched her ripped off her shirt and grabbed and bruised her [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=63.08s)]
*  She was pressed about those allegations and here's her response. I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=67.84s)]
*  Know this is a sensitive question, but I have to ask it [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=72.28s)]
*  You you did take out a temporary order of protection against your husband in 2021 were you in fear of your husband? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=75.08s)]
*  Husband is alive. Um, that's all I can say [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=85.36s)]
*  Okay, then you know not gonna push on that apparently [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=91.68s)]
*  President Trump also doubling down on the allegations of MS 13 though Abrego Garcia's lawyers maintain [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=95.56s)]
*  He hasn't been charged with any crime in any country [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=100.88s)]
*  When Garcia was originally arrested he was wearing a sweatshirt with rolls of money pouring out an MSD and an MS [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  13 gang symbol that he was driving with two other known violent MS 13 gang members two of the most violent members [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=112.72s)]
*  that we know of in the MS 13 gang of thugs [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  Regardless of the accusations against Abrego Garcia Democrats argue he should have been able to present his case before a judge [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=126.28s)]
*  They say the fact that he was deported without one is a big problem [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  We need to bring mr. Abrego [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=137.6s)]
*  Garcia home to protect his constitutional rights to do process [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=140.1s)]
*  and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=146.7s)]
*  It's also important that people understand this case is not just about one man [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=147.7s)]
*  It's about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen who you just saw there also met with a brave Garcia in El Salvador [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=161.82s)]
*  He's addressing what has been dubbed in some reports as Margaritagate [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=166.58s)]
*  It comes after photos were captured of the two with what looked like margaritas on the table during their meeting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=169.3s)]
*  They look like [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=176.74s)]
*  Margaritas and if you look at the one they put in front of kilmar it actually had a little less liquid than the one [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=178.34s)]
*  In me in front of me to try to make it look I assume like he drank out of it [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=184.34s)]
*  Let me just be very clear [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  Let me just be very clear neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  Van Hollen accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from a humanitarian issues what they call it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  He will be on Fox News on Sunday tomorrow, and we expect him to talk more about this Rachel Charlie and Emily [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much Maddie great report. So Charlie if you're explaining margaritas, are you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=212.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's pretty safe to say without a doubt it is really really extraordinary [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=217.78s)]
*  The when you look and you look at the people who get [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=223.38000000000002s)]
*  People from the outside and the same with the court ruling this morning where you have the ACLU you have all these groups coming [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=228.9s)]
*  out to defend [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=235.22s)]
*  actual accused gang members [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  And then you have an actual sitting member of Congress willing to stick his neck out like this [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  And where were these people for all of the victims of? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=245.16s)]
*  Migrant crimes well you just wonder like especially after that remarkable interview with Michael Strahan and with the with the wife of of this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=250.8s)]
*  Ms. 13 suspect saying were you ever afraid of your ms. 13 husband and she has this like because obviously she had she twice [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=258.76s)]
*  I think she [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=266.7s)]
*  Charged him with domestic abuse and she wouldn't answer the question [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=268.04s)]
*  She's afraid of him now, and he's in El Salvador. I thought that was remarkable and also Emily [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=272.96s)]
*  There seems to be no regret like at some point like he was over there when we found out about the domestic [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  abuse charges and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=286.84s)]
*  He doesn't seem regretful and since then several Democrats have said in in Congress have said yeah [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=288.88s)]
*  We're gonna make trips on our own dime to go over there because they didn't think that Mike Johnson would approve the expense, right? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=294.52s)]
*  This is the party that loves to use the phrase credible allegations of sexual assault right and yet here [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  We have in her own handwriting [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=306.44s)]
*  She filed those motions with the court and quoting her she called her husband violent abusive really scary [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=308.44s)]
*  Detailed that he punched her in the face left bruises all over her body and President Trump in the office [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=315.02000000000004s)]
*  Quoted her in that yesterday you mentioned this earlier [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=320.0s)]
*  And he went on to say so this is the guy that the Dems want to bring back to the US [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=323.16s)]
*  And to our point is the ongoing conversation about who are they representing who are they prioritizing and the answer is they're representing not [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=327.04s)]
*  Americans not lawful Americans and they're prioritizing illegal immigrants with these sketchy [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  histories at best and at most horrifying allegations that if true it just goes to show how our [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=341.04s)]
*  Tax dollars are being wielded and the narrative that these guys are pushing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=347.68s)]
*  Yeah, because if that's the person that they're going to bat for no angel families [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=351.1s)]
*  I by the way couldn't find one example of senator van Hollen meeting with an angel family or even a family of a victim of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  Violent crime none of that on his watch Patty mourn was his constituent. She's a Marylander [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=361.72s)]
*  The guy from El Salvador is not a Maryland in Lander [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=367.24s)]
*  He's an El Salvadoran who came here illegally who beat up his wife who by the way is the latest me to case as far as I'm [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sez7Yijgg1A&t=370.72s)]
