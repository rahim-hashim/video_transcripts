# Shocking details revealed on Columbia, City College protest arrests
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU)
*  Four minutes before the bottom of the hour, Fox News alert NYPD revealing that of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=0.0s)]
*  nearly 300 people arrested on Columbia and City College on New York campuses Tuesday, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=3.9s)]
*  half of those had no affiliation with either school. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=9.24s)]
*  At Columbia, outsiders made up nearly 30% of the arrests, City College that number 60% [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=12.0s)]
*  as protests continue across the city. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=17.72s)]
*  Our next guest says the faculty at his school are complicit in these protests, he even goes [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=19.66s)]
*  further than that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  Jeff Lax is a City University of New York law professor and joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=26.16s)]
*  Jeff, not only do you say they're complicit, you say they're organizing behind it, the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=29.76s)]
*  faculty. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=34.72s)]
*  They're organizing it, absolutely. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=35.72s)]
*  The unions are behind union, union, union. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  They have all the money. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  What's the common denominator in that graphic you saw? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=41.84s)]
*  China and UAE, what do they have in common? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=45.6s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  You have the communists combining with the Islamists. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  They really have no goals in common except anti-America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And the unions are the faculty members behind the unions who are absolutely, we have emails [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=56.6s)]
*  proving that they are coordinating with the Gaza encampment people, coordinating with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=61.96s)]
*  them, meeting with them, having meetings with them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=67.44s)]
*  They are absolutely organizing behind every student protest. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=70.06s)]
*  There are Marxist faculty members, I promise you that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=74.68s)]
*  Kennedy School did a study, they asked the people in colleges, what are the issues that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=78.68s)]
*  matter most to you? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Do you know the Gaza, the war in Gaza was 16 in March. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  So this is just a, this is a war of opportunity, a issue of opportunity, isn't it? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=88.52s)]
*  Absolutely, 100%. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=94.88s)]
*  I compared it to you off the air between the allied forces and the Russians in World War [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=96.44s)]
*  II. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  What do we have in common, a common enemy? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  That was the only thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=102.8s)]
*  In that time it was obviously the Nazis and today it's America. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  It's Western culture and America. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  So you think that people say, well, anti-Semitic, well that's been around forever. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=109.88s)]
*  Liffey, you know, open up your mind. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=113.6s)]
*  This is about anti-American. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=115.96s)]
*  The Jews are the low-hanging fruit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=118.36s)]
*  That is the first thing that gets knocked off. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=120.8s)]
*  Next is Western culture and America. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  You're seeing it in Europe. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=125.16s)]
*  We should have seen this in Europe five years ago, three years ago. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=126.66s)]
*  We're seeing it now here very up close and personal. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=129.68s)]
*  But you know this among the faculty. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  That's who gets hired and you have tenure right now, you're department chair, and you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=133.92s)]
*  only teach online because you're afraid for your safety. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=137.84s)]
*  Yeah, because I've seen my colleagues get investigated for complaining about anti-Semitism [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=141.12s)]
*  and students go on RapeMyProfessor.com and write lies about them, calling them racists [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  and all sorts of horrible tropes just because they stood up to anti-Semitism. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=151.72s)]
*  So what can change? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=157.0s)]
*  Is it possible to change the direction now that we got a collective wake-up call from [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=158.34s)]
*  coast to coast? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=162.84s)]
*  44 campuses in 26 states. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  I think the immigration problem is a big part of this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=167.12s)]
*  One of the reasons that I say that is because we see new people straight out of other countries [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  coming right into our country and onto our campuses. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=175.96s)]
*  And a lot of them spew anti-Semitic tropes from day one because they're coming from countries [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  all over. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  People think Venezuela, Mexico, but they're coming from countries all over the world that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  teach hating Jews and teach hating America. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=188.84s)]
*  Both of those things. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  These foreign students take valuable places. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  15,000 in Colombia alone. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=195.72s)]
*  You wonder how many are protesting against us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=198.72s)]
*  They should be expelled right away. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=200.76s)]
*  And Jeff, talking about it, he's got the courage to speak about it and put his name behind it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=202.88s)]
*  Jeff, thanks so much. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=206.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=207.84s)]
*  We'll talk more on radio. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=208.84s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQGxcZUL5RU&t=209.84s)]
