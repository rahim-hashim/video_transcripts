# Gen.  Keane: The damage to Iran is beyond what's being reported
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c)
*  Fox News alert a new retaliatory threat from Iran less than a week after Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=0.0s)]
*  Counter-strike against the regime as the ayatollah says last Saturday's IDF strike quote too big to ignore and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=4.92s)]
*  They could deliver on that threat before Tuesday's US elections Iran sources adding quote [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=11.88s)]
*  The response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Zionist regime's aggression will be definitive and painful [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=17.38s)]
*  Here to react is retired four-star general Fox News senior strategic analyst and chairman of the Institute of the Study of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=23.46s)]
*  War general Jack Keane general 20 sites a hundred aircraft many people said limited [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=30.0s)]
*  Israel held back to not get a retaliatory strike you view that strike very [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=35.96s)]
*  Dev in a devastating way didn't you? Oh? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=41.64s)]
*  Yeah, very much so the military effects of that strike is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=45.28s)]
*  Beyond what's being reported because they have literally taken down [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=49.6s)]
*  most of the Russian air defense system the so-called s 300 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=53.56s)]
*  Missile defense systems that the Russians gave them years ago, and that's what's really protecting their nuclear enterprise [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=58.38s)]
*  Their oil and gas industry and other key strategic assets like the missile production [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=64.9s)]
*  factories that the Israelis did destroy at multiple sites [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=71.38s)]
*  Those are ballistic missile factories by the way so yes this air defense system destruction is really powerful because [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=76.78s)]
*  Iran is sitting there essentially naked and and they know full well that if they conduct another [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=86.08s)]
*  significant attack on Israel their vulnerability is absolutely staggering for Israel to come and do a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=92.92s)]
*  Completely comprehensive attack which would likely have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=101.2s)]
*  Economic impact on them not just military impact the nuclear target targets [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=105.12s)]
*  Which I don't believe would be struck because they need us help to do significant damage [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=109.72s)]
*  So I think it remains to be seen what Iran's going to do [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=114.72s)]
*  They're just saying they're going to use a rock to do this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=118.32s)]
*  But that won't change the scenario for Israel whether the missiles come from Iraq or the missiles are launched out of out of Iran [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=121.48s)]
*  They're being obviously executed by Iranian leaders and Israel will hold them accountable [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=129.1s)]
*  And Iran as I said is very vulnerable here [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=134.88s)]
*  We'll see if this is bluster on the part of the Iranians or they really going to deliver another comprehensive attack [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=138.27999999999997s)]
*  Remains to be seen it should be noted that the foreign minister was in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  Russia and they're helping out Russia in Ukraine [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  And they will evidently have a handshake agreement on some type of missile defense deal [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  But that takes time to put in real quick North Koreans between eight and ten thousand [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Seem to have reported to the battlefield fighting for Russia [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm seeing some reports that there's a lot of dead North Koreans already who have been put up there like cannon fire to almost like [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  The prisoners when the Russians bailed them out of prison to go fight. What are you thinking their role will be? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  Well ISW is reporting that they are in curse [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  That's the salient that the Ukrainians have achieved inside of Russia and they're wearing Russian uniforms [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=179.76s)]
*  They've had some basic rudimentary training in Russia before putting in there [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=186.2s)]
*  I mean what we've got here are troops that have never been battle tested before from from North Korea [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=190.66s)]
*  We have no idea about the quality of their training [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  I would select I would assume that there's selected troops more like special operation forces who represent [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  elite forces in the sense that they receive more resources than the than the rest of the the troops in the in the North Korean military I [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=207.82s)]
*  Don't think this is a decisive thing Russia needs people they're losing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=216.22s)]
*  30,000 people a month that are killed and wounded [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=220.78s)]
*  57,000 actually in in just October [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=224.5s)]
*  Last month the most significant losses they've ever had in the war [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=227.3s)]
*  So they they knew need they need people if this is if this is going to be a pipeline in other words [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=231.1s)]
*  They're gonna get ten thousand a month that would be significant [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=237.3s)]
*  But if this is just ten thousand and that's it it will not be decisive even in the battle of cursed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  It will not be decisive much less the overall war in Ukraine. Yeah and general it's just what they get in response to they get more sophisticated [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=247.22000000000003s)]
*  the cyber [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=255.74s)]
*  Intelligence from Russia what does Russia give the North Koreans in response with the North Koreans have already given them [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  So if they're gonna come come out of the dark ages, we'll have to keep an eye on it general. Thanks so much [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Brian. Have a great weekend you and the team. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEkJ_wbg8c&t=270.58s)]
