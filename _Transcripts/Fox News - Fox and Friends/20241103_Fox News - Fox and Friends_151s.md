# Crucial NY district ‘will determine’ the outcome of congress, GOP rep says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg)
*  We've got a horrific story here in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=0.0s)]
*  A Chilean national charged with shooting his girlfriend [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  and her two teenage sons, killing one of the boys, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  is an illegal migrant who re-entered the United States [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=8.76s)]
*  after being deported 20 years ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=11.52s)]
*  Congressman Mike Lawler joins us right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=14.0s)]
*  This happened in your district. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=16.16s)]
*  You know, we've seen this a million times. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=18.32s)]
*  People, deported, come back in, do stuff, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=20.76s)]
*  shouldn't have been here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=23.88s)]
*  No question. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  And as you point out, he was voluntarily deported [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=27.52s)]
*  over 20 years ago, came back into the United States, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=30.88s)]
*  and in 2018 was arrested for DWI in Westchester County. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=34.2s)]
*  Westchester County, like New York City, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=39.32s)]
*  like New York State, is a sanctuary county, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=41.4s)]
*  and the refusal to cooperate [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=44.32s)]
*  with immigration and customs officials is outrageous, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=46.36s)]
*  and it's wrong. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=50.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  This man had no business being here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=52.38s)]
*  Last night, I was in Somers with the family [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=54.44s)]
*  and the community to honor the life of the young boy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=57.68s)]
*  that was killed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=61.28s)]
*  It's tragic. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=62.68s)]
*  This never should have happened. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=64.92s)]
*  In the meantime, you know, it looks like control [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  of the House of Representatives [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=69.4s)]
*  actually runs through New York State, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=70.64s)]
*  and the Democrats are running a guy big on defunding [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=73.24s)]
*  the police. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=76.64s)]
*  I've seen your ads, you remind people of that, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  and it sounds like it's working [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=79.0s)]
*  because you're up in the polls right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=80.88s)]
*  No question. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=83.72s)]
*  Last public poll had us up five. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=84.56s)]
*  My opponent, Mondaire Jones, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=86.6s)]
*  is a radical far-left socialist supported by AOC, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=91.28s)]
*  He supports defunding the police, cashless bail, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=93.6s)]
*  open borders. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=96.44s)]
*  He wanted to give blanket amnesty to criminal aliens, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=97.28s)]
*  allow cop killers the right to vote from prison. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=100.92s)]
*  We do not need him back in Congress, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=104.36s)]
*  and this district will determine the outcome [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=106.4s)]
*  of control of Congress, so folks want to help. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=109.4s)]
*  They can text Mike to 85007, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=111.68s)]
*  or go to lawlerforcongress.com [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=114.6s)]
*  and help us with a last minute push. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=116.56s)]
*  Last minute question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=118.92s)]
*  Do you have a prediction about the House of Representatives? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=120.16s)]
*  I think we hold on and grow the majority. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=123.68s)]
*  I think we flip the Senate, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=126.88s)]
*  and I do believe Donald Trump will be the 47th president [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=128.28s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=131.24s)]
*  Okay, very good. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=132.56s)]
*  Mike Lawler joining us from his district in upstate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=133.52s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us, sir. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9FZJ2lzYg&t=136.84s)]
