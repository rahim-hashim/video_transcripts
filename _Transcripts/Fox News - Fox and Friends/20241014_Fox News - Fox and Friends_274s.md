# Speaker Johnson FIRES back at NBC for 'edited' interview
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4)
*  Let's talk about Speaker Johnson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=0.0s)]
*  He did two shows. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=1.34s)]
*  He did Face the Nation, and I'll tell you about that in a moment. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=2.1s)]
*  But on NBC, on Meet the Press, they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=5.38s)]
*  were trying to get Speaker Johnson to force President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=8.22s)]
*  Trump to take an exam because Kamala Harris did, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  which is crazy because Kamala Harris, who's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=13.86s)]
*  in denial about the president's cognitive malfunctions [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=16.14s)]
*  and never been called on the carpet about that, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=19.66s)]
*  suddenly has a great interest in President Trump's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=21.66s)]
*  overall health. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=24.18s)]
*  Listen to this exchange. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=25.1s)]
*  You can see that he didn't release his medical records. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  You don't want to know things like his cholesterol level, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=30.24s)]
*  whether he's dealing with any issue that we may not [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=32.2s)]
*  know about if he's going to be commander in chief. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=34.8s)]
*  And he also said he would relieve cognitive tests [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=37.12s)]
*  that he aced. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=39.6s)]
*  Should he release that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=41.6s)]
*  The American people, Kristen, the American people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=42.6s)]
*  don't care about the cholesterol level of Donald Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=45.96s)]
*  They care about the cost of living [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and the fact they cannot pay for groceries [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=50.0s)]
*  because Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's policies [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=52.28s)]
*  have put them in that situation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=54.92s)]
*  The medical records are irrelevant. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  Let's talk about things that the American people care about. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=58.5s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump is surging in the polls [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=61.22s)]
*  because he's doing that on stages and interviews [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  nonstop around the clock. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=66.9s)]
*  And Kamala Harris has done nothing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=68.62s)]
*  I mean, I have a few pulled up, most important issues. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=71.3s)]
*  I do not see Donald Trump's cholesterol anywhere on the, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=74.3s)]
*  oh, maybe it's lower. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=77.38s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=78.94s)]
*  And meanwhile, when Carl Bernstein came out and said, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=80.66s)]
*  you know, Biden looked like he had rigor mortis, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=83.1s)]
*  they couldn't ask any questions about health records. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=85.6s)]
*  What is wrong with these people? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=87.84s)]
*  How touched can you be? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=89.24s)]
*  So first of all, looking at all the Sunday School, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=90.48s)]
*  it was a bloodbath for the media and Democrats. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=92.36s)]
*  It's just so bad. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=94.6s)]
*  And being a sports guy my entire life [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=95.8s)]
*  is always bad when a sports king, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=98.6s)]
*  when they start to have fun with their opponent. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=100.96s)]
*  The Republicans are just having fun with the media right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=102.8s)]
*  Every single time, I mean, it's just like layups. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=105.68s)]
*  Like, are you listening to yourself? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=107.32s)]
*  Do you understand the question that you're asking? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=108.8s)]
*  They're laughing at you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=111.6s)]
*  in the middle of your interviews right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=113.2s)]
*  I don't recall that being a time Republicans do, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=114.84s)]
*  but it's become so easy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  They're complete lightweights now [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=119.22s)]
*  with some of the questions that they're posing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  But I think this is also an issue, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  with all due respect, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=125.16s)]
*  that the Democrats do not want to play. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  If you want to talk about the health [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=128.26s)]
*  and fitness of a president, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=130.18s)]
*  don't look at the candidate for president. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=131.66s)]
*  Look at the current person in the Oval Office [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=134.18s)]
*  and their story after story [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=137.16s)]
*  of the scripted cabinet meetings, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=139.34s)]
*  that Jill Biden is there assisting, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=140.9s)]
*  them trying to conceal, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=142.86s)]
*  the fact that they needed Nancy Pelosi [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=144.48s)]
*  to save the day doing the debt ceiling bill. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the story after story [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=148.82s)]
*  about how crazy it is right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=150.28s)]
*  Well, and you know, when you think about it, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=151.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris started to make some hay in the polls [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=154.04s)]
*  a while back when she said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=157.28s)]
*  "'Look, Donald Trump is afraid to debate me a second time.'" [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=158.36s)]
*  And so now what she's looking for is something else [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  where it's like, that's a question why he's- [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=164.28s)]
*  Cholesterol ain't it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=166.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=167.76s)]
*  And so that's why she, on Friday, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=169.08s)]
*  released her health records, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  because she knows he's not going to do it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  She also said, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=175.34s)]
*  "'Look, he won't debate me again.'" [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=176.18s)]
*  He didn't go on 16 minutes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  The question is, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  do you really care about somebody's lipid levels? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  Are you worried about somebody's lipid levels? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=182.66s)]
*  If you're a loved one, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  if you're married to him or related to him, I get it, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  but I think people are gonna vote not for Donald Trump, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=190.5s)]
*  whether or not he's got high HDL, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=193.06s)]
*  but what he's gonna do for our, ultimately, our pocket. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  The guy does a million rallies a week. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=199.58s)]
*  He's just fine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  I can assure you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=202.36s)]
*  So, Speaker Jotson, I texted him, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  just asked him about that exchange last night, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  and he said, did you see CBS? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  And I said, no, so I put on Face the Nation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  He says they edited his video. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=209.72000000000003s)]
*  He says, I'll never agree to it again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  Wow, just like 60 minutes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  He says they edited, he goes, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=214.0s)]
*  on Face the Nation, it was even more direct, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=215.44000000000003s)]
*  but they edited it out. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=219.28000000000003s)]
*  He goes, I did the interview to make, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  they made me, they made Como look better. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=222.4s)]
*  They edited my video to try to make me look less effective. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  I will never agree to a non-live interview with CBS again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=227.72000000000003s)]
*  Journalistic malpractice. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=231.04s)]
*  It's 60 minutes did it, the flash, flash, flash, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=232.5s)]
*  the CBS again. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=234.9s)]
*  And we know they added videos, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  because we seen it last week, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=237.34s)]
*  what they did to Como, completely took a question [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  and lasted to another answer. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if that was ever okay in media. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  But for, to the speaker's point, Brian, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=245.62s)]
*  that's why he will never do anything that is not live. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=248.72s)]
*  That's why, that's the problem for us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  We do everything live. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=253.38s)]
*  We would like to fix stuff, when we can. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0E1-zMbk4&t=254.62s)]
