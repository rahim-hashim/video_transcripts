# Meet the actor behind John the Baptist on Martin Scorsese's 'The Saints'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A)
*  The second episode of Martin Scorsese's Presents the Saints is now streaming on Fox Nation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=0.0s)]
*  and it's all about John the Baptist. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=7.2s)]
*  Repent! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=9.84s)]
*  The kingdom of God is here! [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=10.84s)]
*  Repentance! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=17.28s)]
*  The Messiah is among us! [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=18.64s)]
*  Come and be baptized in the River Jordan and repent! [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=25.12s)]
*  Actor Yaha Mahaney plays John the Baptist and he joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=30.48s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=34.24s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=36.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=37.04s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=38.4s)]
*  Thank you for coming on and making time for us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=38.96s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Tell us about this episode and what it was like to play him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=41.92s)]
*  Good question. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=46.96s)]
*  I've watched the episode. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Obviously, I didn't write the episode, so I worked with what was there and I think it captures [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=52.24s)]
*  to some extent the essence of and the importance of John the Baptist in his [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=59.2s)]
*  quest for truth and his humility in the process and the fact that he was just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=69.52s)]
*  conscious and desirous of paving the way for another, as he says in the series, namely Jesus, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=77.12s)]
*  who is much revered, obviously, both John the Baptist and Jesus, but in terms of conveying [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=84.72s)]
*  the message of repentance, of turning back to God. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  It's funny because I thought about it longly as to what repentance actually means. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=98.16s)]
*  To some extent, it's just believing in mercy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  And so that was a big responsibility for me, obviously, to attempt to incarnate a role bearing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  in mind that I'm not a saint and I wouldn't even purport to be able to qualify myself as anyone [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=116.16s)]
*  even remotely close to the saintliness of John the Baptist. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=126.64s)]
*  So it was a huge responsibility and I tried my best. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=130.0s)]
*  Well, you did a beautiful job. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=133.6s)]
*  Yes, I can't imagine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=135.6s)]
*  I've read about his life, my entire life, and just someone that we all admire. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=137.2s)]
*  He was so brave, was willing to be imprisoned because he loved his cousin Jesus so badly and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=142.56s)]
*  knew that was his calling on his life. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=148.08s)]
*  The angel appeared to his parents and said, you will have a son and you name him John. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=149.52s)]
*  And he became John the Baptist, actually baptized Jesus and the heavens opened. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=154.0s)]
*  This is what Martin Scorsese says about John the Baptist. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=158.24s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=162.16s)]
*  With John the Baptist, of course, we're used to seeing him strong and muscular and unshakable. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=163.6s)]
*  The thing is, when you stop and think about him, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=170.56s)]
*  that I think you realize he must have been going through some real agony trying to find [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  a spiritual path, his spiritual path, which ultimately I think he understood ultimately [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=180.72s)]
*  is going to lead to his martyrdom. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=185.92s)]
*  What is your reaction to that, Yaha? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=188.4s)]
*  It's funny because finding one spiritual path is agonizing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=190.96s)]
*  At least I can only speak from my experience, but it's such a personal thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=198.16s)]
*  Your faith is such a personal endeavor and it's a spiritual path. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=205.04s)]
*  At least saints, they had it very difficult because they chose a specific way, notwithstanding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=211.52s)]
*  the risks associated with it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=216.56s)]
*  I just hope that it inspires some people to just be inspired by the messages of truth, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=219.36s)]
*  of compassion, of mercy, and above all, humility. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=226.16s)]
*  Actually, if I may say so, one of the best, because humility is obviously a term and there's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=230.24s)]
*  various subjective definitions of what humility is, but there's one French philosopher whom I [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=236.96s)]
*  really admire. Her name is Simone Buell, W-E-I-L, and she wrote a book, Waiting for God, and I [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=244.0s)]
*  think it's in there or another one of her writings where she defines humility as an intelligent form [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=253.52s)]
*  of just the capacity of attention. Anyway, there's a lot of nuance under that definition, but it's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=260.48s)]
*  the fact that we're all in this together and there's something incredibly miraculous about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=266.32s)]
*  being here. It's a journey for each one of us, which may be agonizing sometimes, but also [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=272.4s)]
*  uplifting in others. Yeah, absolutely. I can relate to that. You might be persecuted. In John the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=277.76s)]
*  Baptist's case, it caused him to die eventually for being a Christian or to standing up for what [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=283.12s)]
*  he believed in and talking about Jesus. Thank you so much. You did a beautiful job. I encourage [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=289.28s)]
*  everyone to go and watch it's own Fox Nation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzmUyhep7A&t=294.23999999999995s)]
