# 177 dead in South Korean plane crash
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM)
*  A devastating plane crash in South Korea has left at least 177 people dead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=0.0s)]
*  The Boeing 737-800 plane carrying 181 people on board is skidded off the runway at an airport [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=5.2s)]
*  about 180 miles south of Seoul earlier today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=13.14s)]
*  Cleanup continuing this morning after the aircraft exploded on impact with a concrete [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=16.44s)]
*  wall at Muang. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=21.76s)]
*  That's the international airport there in South Korea. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=25.32s)]
*  The video of this crash is graphic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=28.0s)]
*  We want to give some of our viewers a warning because you may find this disturbing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=30.56s)]
*  Incredibly, two crew members were pulled from the wreckage alive by emergency crews [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=52.0s)]
*  without any life-threatening injuries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=56.46s)]
*  Local officials say the control tower issued a bird strike warning shortly afterward and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  shortly afterwards. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=64.86s)]
*  Pilots declared May Day and then pilots attempted to land. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=66.38s)]
*  Reports also saying the Boeing 737-800 jet's landing gear was not deployed during the crash [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=69.9s)]
*  landing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=75.86s)]
*  Sad, sad story that played out on many people's social media timeline and right there for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=76.86s)]
*  all of us to see this morning as well how it occurred. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=82.94s)]
*  Let's bring in Mike Boyd. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=85.1s)]
*  He's an aviation consultant to shed a little more light on this sad tragedy in South Korea. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=86.1s)]
*  Mike, when you see that video of the crash, what stands out to you? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  Number one, the gear is not extended. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=95.94s)]
*  The flaps are not extended, which would indicate that there was a major hydraulic failure of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=99.46s)]
*  some kind there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  I understand that even when there's a hydraulic failure, there's a mechanical way of dropping [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=105.38s)]
*  the landing gear. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  That was not done. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to be kind of in the dark here till we find the cockpit voice recorder [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=112.14s)]
*  and the black box for this because it looks like there was a bird strike from some earlier [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=116.28s)]
*  picture of it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=122.14s)]
*  They did vector the airplane around to the other end of the runway, so there was control. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  But landing at this speed or coming down at this speed with the gear not down, it looks [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=127.94s)]
*  like that airplane suffered some major hydraulic failure of some kind. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=134.76s)]
*  We don't know what that will be until we get the black boxes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=140.04s)]
*  Mike, the black boxes have been found, so hopefully some answers will come soon from [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=142.4s)]
*  that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=147.28s)]
*  But I'm curious, if you could explain, for those of us who don't know a lot about this, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=148.28s)]
*  how can a bird strike, what impact does that have? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  And also, this hydraulic failure, is that entirely mechanical or could there be a pilot [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=156.44s)]
*  decision or problem with that as well? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=164.12s)]
*  Well, there are a million backups on this airplane. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=170.44s)]
*  It's extremely safe. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=172.56s)]
*  And that's what a lot of people are saying. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=173.56s)]
*  They can't understand why this airplane landed on that runway at that speed with no flaps, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  with no gear. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  There might have been something else involved. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=182.64s)]
*  But a bird strike on an engine might shut an engine down. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  But there's so many redundant systems there, it just doesn't make sense. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=187.44s)]
*  So we're in the dark here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=192.16s)]
*  But we know this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  The runway is 9,200 feet. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=196.72s)]
*  It's a very long runway. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=197.72s)]
*  It did come in hot and high, hot and fast. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't know why that was. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=202.68s)]
*  The real issue, that airplane was probably damaged more than we think. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=204.56s)]
*  And it may not have been just the bird strike. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=207.88s)]
*  There might have been other things that happened to that airplane. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=209.8s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=212.64s)]
*  But it's very strange to have that airplane land that hot on a runway. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=213.64s)]
*  It's 9,200 feet to the point where it literally was still going pretty strong when it hit [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=217.84s)]
*  that wall. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=222.28s)]
*  I still can't wrap my head around the idea that there were two people who survived that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=223.52s)]
*  crash, and especially when you watch the explosion at the end. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=228.16s)]
*  Are you surprised by that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=232.12s)]
*  And how does anybody survive something like that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=233.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=236.88s)]
*  I'm thrilled by it, actually, for their families. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=237.88s)]
*  They're both flight attendants. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=240.24s)]
*  They're probably in the jump seats in the very back of the airplane. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=241.24s)]
*  And you know, it makes sense. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=244.6s)]
*  The airplane absorbed all that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=245.6s)]
*  They really got away with the very lucky position where they were, because they weren't very [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=248.08s)]
*  far from the rest of the passengers on that airplane. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  So God love them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=255.56s)]
*  It's a wonderful thing that they were blessed that way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  But these things do happen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=259.92s)]
*  And again, how an airplane breaks up when it hits the ground, it's different every time. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=262.08s)]
*  Mike, you know, I've always been told, and I'd love for you to tell me if this is accurate [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=267.92s)]
*  or not, that it's actually more risky during takeoff than it is on landing for most air [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=272.2s)]
*  flights. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  We all feel the jolt when we land and feel a bit of nervousness. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  But landing is what I've been told is one of the more safe aspects of air travel. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=282.36s)]
*  But I want you to tell me if that's true or not. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  But I also want to see if I understand what you were telling Rachel correctly. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=289.16s)]
*  Is it possible to land a plane and get it to stop without its landing gear belly first, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=293.44s)]
*  like we saw there, if the runway is long enough to bring it to a stop? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=299.44s)]
*  Or should perhaps the pilot, if the plane was capable, avoid it landing and try to stay [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=303.92s)]
*  up until the issues are resolved? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  I would suspect the second part they were doing, because I understand they didn't go [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  around. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  That's reported. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  But keep in mind, you know, yes, there are belly landings all the time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's not unheard of. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=324.24s)]
*  But in this case, that airplane didn't have its flaps. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=326.64s)]
*  That meant it was coming in at a much higher speed to stay in the sky. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  And that meant, bang, we're going way too fast on that runway. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  It has to do with the flaps in this case. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=338.8s)]
*  The landing gear itself, we've had those things happen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=340.92s)]
*  But we are landing at a very, very high speed because you can't slow down because you'll [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=343.88s)]
*  fall out of the sky. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=347.72s)]
*  It's a tough thing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=349.36s)]
*  And we don't know what the background of the crew was. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=350.36s)]
*  I would suspect they were very qualified. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=351.88s)]
*  This airline's been in business almost 20 years. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=354.16s)]
*  It's almost a new airport. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  So all those things, I don't think will be factors, but we will find out. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=358.24s)]
*  Mike, it can't be ignored that this was a Boeing plane. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  Can you talk to us about that? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  Because there have been some issues with Boeing as late. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  In fact, even some issues with airplanes, Boeing airplanes that very day and other airports. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  Nothing deadly, but. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't go there with that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=377.44s)]
*  I really wouldn't. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we had a separate set of things that happened. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  And this Boeing is 800 is a very safe airplane. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=385.04s)]
*  There's never been any systemic problems with it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  So I would say it's not a Boeing issue. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=390.68s)]
*  I always want to look at that because you learn something from every crash. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=393.0s)]
*  You learn something. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  But the fact of the matter here is we do we do know that some systems on that airplane were not working and we knew there was a bird strike right before. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=398.67999999999995s)]
*  That's probably the path they're going to go down right away, although every path is open. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOM1a5AziVM&t=407.2s)]
