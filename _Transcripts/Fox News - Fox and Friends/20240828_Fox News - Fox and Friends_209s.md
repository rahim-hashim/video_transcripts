# There's no hiding the motive behind the latest Trump indictment: Cherkasky
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0)
*  former president trump has been indicted again in the election interference case [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=0.0s)]
*  brought by special counsel jack smith [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=4.4s)]
*  the indictment was revised after the supreme court's presidential immunity [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  ruling last month [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  and here to react is former federal prosecutor katie [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=11.36s)]
*  churkowski [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=14.22s)]
*  hello katie thanks for joining us [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=15.08s)]
*  so you think this is purely political right [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=16.96s)]
*  there's almost no legitimate legal purpose to jack smith bringing this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=19.66s)]
*  superseding indictment at this point because the issues that were raised by [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=23.54s)]
*  the supreme court with the immunity ruling needed to be litigated by the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=27.22s)]
*  trial judge anyway and they could have certainly done that with the existing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  indictment so this seems like a pure headline grab in my opinion during the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=34.58s)]
*  heart of the campaign season they want these have these headlines right [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=39.46s)]
*  absolutely there's again no chance that this case is going to trial before the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=42.82s)]
*  election there are still so many challenges that need to be looked at [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  with this case and of course if donald trump is elected this could very well [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=50.34s)]
*  be jack smith's final act at all in these cases so i think that this was a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=53.74s)]
*  last ditch effort to bring this to the forefront of the headlines again these [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  cases get so confusing there's new york there was florida there's d.c. there are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  other states [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=64.78s)]
*  this in georgia this is the one about j six correct [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=65.58s)]
*  yes this is what they consider the main election interference case that kind of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=69.26s)]
*  big case that deals with the fake electors schemes and things along those [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=73.42s)]
*  lines but certainly there's a lot of acts in those charges that deal with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  the presidency and the official acts that may or may not have been undertaken [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=81.89999999999999s)]
*  there so [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=85.46s)]
*  so the supreme court recently ruled that presidential immunity for official acts [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=86.38s)]
*  so how do we define official acts with this event an official act and is jack [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  smith just trying to narrow it down and frame it differently [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=94.94s)]
*  well according to jack smith the superseding indictment attempted to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  interpret the supreme court's decision to take out things that they believe [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=101.82s)]
*  would be objectionable i think even based on the face of the new indictment [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  there are still many things that are not in line with the supreme court's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=109.86s)]
*  decision and that's why there's going to be several more layers of review at the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=113.22s)]
*  trial level and all the way up potentially through the supreme court [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=116.74s)]
*  before this could even go forward [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=119.46s)]
*  let's look at president trump's campaign courtroom calendar last september 5th [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=121.26s)]
*  the judge determines how d.c. federal election interference case should move [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=126.5s)]
*  forward then on the 16th of september the judge decided whether to throw out [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=130.22s)]
*  the verdict against trump in the hush money case on the 18th sentencing for new [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=134.5s)]
*  york versus trump on the 26 arguments begin an appeal of the 450 million [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=138.94s)]
*  dollar civil fraud judgment against trump and his business associates then [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=143.5s)]
*  on december 5th arguments began in the appeal for the georgia state election [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=146.98s)]
*  interference case what do you think the average voter is thinking are they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=151.26s)]
*  thinking enough is enough we're going after hunter biden we're going after [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=154.5s)]
*  donald trump let's just have an election i think that people are probably getting [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=158.46s)]
*  very frustrated with what i would consider a law fair these are especially [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=162.74s)]
*  in the jack smith cases very novel legal theories these are not legitimate crimes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=166.26s)]
*  that we've ever seen charged before so certainly it seems like a direct attempt [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=170.86s)]
*  to interfere with the election which is so ironic in a case that is alleging that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=174.94s)]
*  donald trump did the same thing i don't think that there's any sort of hiding the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=178.7s)]
*  fact that this is purely for political purposes especially with regard to the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=183.22s)]
*  j-six case so this will not go forward until after the election there's no [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=186.82s)]
*  possibility for that to happen even if it does withstand the scrutiny on appeal [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=190.82s)]
*  okay katie thank you so much thank you i'm steve ducy i'm brian kill me and i [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hBjxKuP6V0&t=196.14s)]
