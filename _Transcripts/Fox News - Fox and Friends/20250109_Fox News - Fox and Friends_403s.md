# Trump calls for Newsom's resignation: 'This is all his fault!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY)
*  President-elect Trump is calling out California's Gavin Newsom over the state's response to the fires and its long-term planning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=0.0s)]
*  Nate Foy is live in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=7.4s)]
*  Hey, Nate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Hey, guys. Good morning. President-elect Donald Trump is highly critical of California Governor Gavin Newsom's water management decisions in the years preceding these horrific fires. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=12.4s)]
*  Namely, Trump says that Newsom should have and refused to sign a water declaration or water restoration declaration that could have put California in a much better position to fight these fires. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=23.3s)]
*  I've been trying to get Gavin Newsom to allow water to come. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=36.6s)]
*  You'd have tremendous water up there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=39.6s)]
*  They sent it out to the Pacific because they're trying to protect a tiny little fish. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=41.0s)]
*  And for the sake of a smelt, they have no water. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=45.6s)]
*  They had no water in the fire hydrants today in Los Angeles. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=47.8s)]
*  This is a true tragedy, and it's a mistake of the governor and you could say the administration. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=50.4s)]
*  So Trump is referring to a 2020 memorandum that he signed meant to bring more water to Los Angeles and other parts of California. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=58.0s)]
*  But the state said it wasn't scientifically justified and sued to block it for concerns about endangered species. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=65.6s)]
*  Newsom's office pushes back on Trump's story, saying, quote, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=72.6s)]
*  There's no such document as the water restoration declaration that is pure fiction. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=75.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump is demanding Newsom's resignation, writing on True Social, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=81.2s)]
*  One of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States of America is burning down to the ground. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=86.0s)]
*  It's ashes and Gavin Newsom should resign. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  This is all his fault. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=94.6s)]
*  Here's Newsom last night. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=96.6s)]
*  One can't even respond to it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=99.4s)]
*  I mean, it's, people are literally fleeing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=101.4s)]
*  People have lost their lives. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=106.7s)]
*  Kids lost their schools. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=108.4s)]
*  Families completely torn asunder. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=111.0s)]
*  Churches burned down. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=113.0s)]
*  This guy wanted to politicize it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=115.0s)]
*  What is the situation with the water? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Obviously in the Palisades, it ran out last night in the hydrants. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=118.0s)]
*  The local folks are trying to figure that out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, just when you have a system that is not dissimilar to what we've seen in other extraordinarily large scale fires, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=123.7s)]
*  whether it be pipe electricity, or whether it just be the complete overwhelm of the system. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=129.6s)]
*  Trump will attend former President Jimmy Carter's funeral in Washington, D.C. today, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  and then he'll fly back to Palm Beach where he will meet with Republican governors at Mar-a-Lago tonight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=141.9s)]
*  We'll send it back to you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=147.6s)]
*  All right, Nate. Thank you very much. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=149.5s)]
*  Yeah, they're talking about the tanks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=151.1s)]
*  They were empty at five o'clock. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=153.1s)]
*  At five o'clock, they were empty. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=154.7s)]
*  On Tuesday. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=156.2s)]
*  On Tuesday. You gotta be kidding me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=157.0s)]
*  Pacific Palisades, I mean, if you have a $3 million home, if the taxes are like New York, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=158.4s)]
*  it's probably $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 in taxes you're paying, and you can't get a hydrant? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=163.1s)]
*  You can't get a hydrant in front of your house? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=168.9s)]
*  I mean, what about working class areas? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  If the higher tax areas can't do this, and Rick Caruso came out and said, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=172.4s)]
*  I talked to firefighters, they are frustrated, they're pulling up, and they said there's no water there, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=178.6s)]
*  and they said that they don't have equipment necessary to fight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=183.0s)]
*  So, and while she decides, Karen Bass says, I'm looking at my budget, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=186.3s)]
*  and I gotta give over a billion to homeless, and I gotta cut $23 million from the budget for firefighters. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=190.0s)]
*  And they came back and said, you can't cut $23. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=196.5s)]
*  So she says, all right, we'll just cut $17. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=198.5s)]
*  How does that sound? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  I would just like someone to tell me the appropriate time to criticize the leadership here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=202.4s)]
*  I mean, to the president, and I talked to the president last night, his criticism is warranted. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  He predicted this before it even happened. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=212.9s)]
*  And he said, this is something that we can do to solve this problem. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=215.6s)]
*  Okay, they don't do it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=219.1s)]
*  And now we're in this mess. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  A governor who loves to do press conference, loves the showboat of, you know, the office. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=221.7s)]
*  But when it comes to management and leadership stuff, he was asked about the fire hydrants, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=229.1s)]
*  and he says he's going to leave it to the locals. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  There's a tragedy going on county to county, okay, city to city. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  You would think the state would have a position on that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=241.0s)]
*  And he says just go to the locals. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=244.5s)]
*  That's a failure of leadership. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=246.2s)]
*  A young man in Pacific Palisades, I saw an interview with him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=247.4s)]
*  He was a high schooler. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=250.0s)]
*  And he said they came to our house to try to hook up to the fire hydrant right in front of our home. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=251.4s)]
*  And there was no water, absolutely no water in this neighborhood in America. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=256.6s)]
*  That shouldn't happen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=261.3s)]
*  Who's responsible for that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=262.3s)]
*  Who should be held accountable? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=263.5s)]
*  Is it Karen Bass? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=265.0s)]
*  Is it whoever's over the community of Pacific Palisades? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=265.9s)]
*  The water problem needs to be fixed there, especially when there was an alert a few days [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=269.5s)]
*  before and Karen Bass goes over to Ghana and then flies back and won't answer questions. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=273.8s)]
*  The reporter says with Sky News says, do you want to apologize to your community? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=279.2s)]
*  She didn't say anything. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=283.5s)]
*  Do you want to apologize for cutting the firefighters budget so much? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=284.5s)]
*  Why is homeless getting more than a billion and firefighters are getting are getting their budget cut 17 million? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=288.2s)]
*  Well, look, the problem was and we you saw live yesterday, there were 100 mile an hour winds. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=295.1s)]
*  You could have a jillion gallons of water. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=300.8s)]
*  It's not going to put it out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=303.0s)]
*  Obviously, what has happened as the winds have gone down and the fire crews have been able to get in and get back up in the air. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=305.2s)]
*  They've been able to use the existing facility. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=311.0s)]
*  One of the problems is they've got these great big tanks. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=313.8s)]
*  Apparently, they've got the city of Los Angeles has 114 massive tanks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=316.0s)]
*  They were all filled up at the beginning. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=320.5s)]
*  But then the you know, nobody was expecting that kind of demand. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=322.8s)]
*  And then it ran out. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=327.3s)]
*  So going forward, your point about criticizing the leadership is is accurate. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=328.6s)]
*  It's like, OK, who decided we would only have this number of things? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  Who decided we would only have this number of tanks, this number of trucks and stuff like this? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  And also going forward, I think a lot of people in California are going to say we could have had more water coming from that San Joaquin Delta thing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  If there weren't so many environmental protections for a tiny little fish that has been declared extinct. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=350.0s)]
*  Even Donald Trump in November of 2018, almost nine years ago, he was out in the woods with Gavin Newsom saying, remember, fix your forest. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=357.0s)]
*  How can Austria do this? How can Finland do this? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=365.7s)]
*  They have many more trees and more forests than you do in California. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=369.1s)]
*  And they don't have forest fires like California does. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=372.1s)]
*  I wonder if those tanks are actually full, Steve. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=374.5s)]
*  I know you got to take them at their word. Who's checking them? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=376.5s)]
*  But I wonder if they are actually even full because you don't run out in hours. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=378.3s)]
*  We don't even doesn't matter if it's a big or small fire. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=382.2s)]
*  You can't run out hours into a huge fire even before you even know the magnitude of it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=383.8s)]
*  You maybe you can't get it out, but you could just save neighborhoods. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkXCa7poZgY&t=389.3s)]
