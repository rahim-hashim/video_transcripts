# Trump, Zelenskyy hold ‘productive’ meeting in Rome ahead of Pope Francis’ funeral #foxnews #trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg)
*  Zelensky and Donald Trump, President Trump, huddled together inside of St. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=0.0s)]
*  Peter's Basilica, clearly talking about the war, a war that Donald Trump has sworn [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=4.8s)]
*  to bring to an end. I'll just say this, Pope Francis was not a big fan of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=10.08s)]
*  Donald Trump. I think Joe Biden was more his speed, but he who was a peacemaker, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=15.92s)]
*  he talked a lot about ending these wars, Pope Francis did. I think he would approve [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  of that moment that you're looking at right there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=24.64s)]
*  That is such an intimate moment of two leaders with big decisions in front of them [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=27.36s)]
*  and motivations that are, I think, of wanting to get to a place of peace if they can, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=34.64s)]
*  and I certainly hope that they will. But what a moment. When you look back in history, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=40.88s)]
*  you'll remember this photograph as perhaps the beginning of that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii5L5YInjFg&t=45.2s)]
