# 'FITTING END': Biden called out over last-minute 'admission of guilt'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k)
*  I was surprised that President Biden would go and pardon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=0.0s)]
*  his whole family, because that makes him look very guilty. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=7.96s)]
*  You know, I could have pardoned my family. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=10.24s)]
*  I could have pardoned myself, my family. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=12.6s)]
*  I said, if I do that, it's going to make me look very guilty. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=14.48s)]
*  I don't think I'd be sitting here, frankly. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=17.32s)]
*  Yeah, and how great must have been for him [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=21.36s)]
*  to be back in the Oval Office right there, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=23.52s)]
*  talking to the press. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=25.2s)]
*  President Trump reacted to former President Biden's, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=26.72s)]
*  yes, former President Biden's person, I've said that, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=29.64s)]
*  blanket pardons for his siblings and their spouses, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=32.2s)]
*  as well as the J-6 committee members. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=36.36s)]
*  He announced it in the final minutes of his presidency. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=38.6s)]
*  Biden explaining, quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=41.24s)]
*  My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  and threats motivated solely by a desire to hurt me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=44.800000000000004s)]
*  Really? Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=47.6s)]
*  these attacks will end. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=49.72s)]
*  New York Post columnist Miranda Devine joins us now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  Miranda, your thoughts about not only the new president's reaction, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=53.84s)]
*  but about the former president's action. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=58.32s)]
*  Look, Brian, I think it was such a fitting end [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=61.92s)]
*  to Joe Biden's presidency because it just shows [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=64.28s)]
*  the nature of the corruption, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  how his family was all involved. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=70.68s)]
*  All his brothers, both Frank and Jim, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=73.08s)]
*  as well as his sister Val and their spouses, have been pardoned. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=76.4s)]
*  And that is an admission of guilt. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=81.36s)]
*  As Donald Trump just said then, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=83.2s)]
*  he didn't do that for his own family, for himself, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=85.12s)]
*  when he was president last time, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=88.2s)]
*  even though he was being hounded by Democrats and lawfare, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=89.72s)]
*  because he said that would be an admission of guilt. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  And that's what Joe Biden has done. He's admitted guilt. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=96.48s)]
*  I'm thinking about James Comer's book [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=99.72s)]
*  when he said there's what, the $240,000 payment [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=101.48s)]
*  from his brother James to Joe. Why did he do it? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, just gave it to him. Really? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=107.12s)]
*  He just gave them that much money. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  What was the reason behind that? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, think about your book, Laptop from Hell. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=111.16s)]
*  You were the first one to forensically go through and say, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=113.04s)]
*  where's this money coming from and where is it? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=115.84s)]
*  Well, that's why Sarah Biden needs a pardon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=118.76s)]
*  She's Jim Biden's wife, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=121.84s)]
*  and she was the one who withdrew cash from their account [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  after Hunter had given them some Chinese money, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=128.2s)]
*  some of the Chinese money that he'd got. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=131.04s)]
*  She takes it out in cash, she puts it into another account, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  and then she cuts a check for Joe Biden, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=136.76s)]
*  and she writes in the memo line, loan repayment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=138.8s)]
*  So, I mean, that is why do you need to go [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=142.12s)]
*  to all those financial shenanigans [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=144.68s)]
*  to write a loan repayment check. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  By the way, Democrats are not happy about this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=149.56s)]
*  They're trying to find their footing, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=151.6s)]
*  and they say Joe Biden's made things [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=153.28s)]
*  markedly worse when he's leaving. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=154.68s)]
*  Amy Klobuchar says, this goes to, I don't support this, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=156.0s)]
*  and this really undermines the justice system, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=159.0s)]
*  and we have to revamp the pardons. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=161.72s)]
*  Well, now they say that, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=163.28s)]
*  but they've been covering up Joe Biden's corruption. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=164.72s)]
*  I mean, it's been in the open. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=167.24s)]
*  We at the New York Post have been exposing it for four years, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=168.52s)]
*  and they've pretended that it was all Russian disinformation, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  and lies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=174.56s)]
*  You're just such a perfect person for this segment [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=175.48s)]
*  and this portion of our interview. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=177.88s)]
*  51 intel agents that signed off [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=180.16s)]
*  that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=182.32s)]
*  Well, that has not slipped by the president's mind. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=185.72s)]
*  He doesn't have short-term memory loss. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=188.24s)]
*  Yesterday, he suspended their security clearances [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=190.12s)]
*  for falsely implying that the laptop was not real. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=193.32s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't imply. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=197.72s)]
*  They said that it was Russian disinformation in their... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=199.04s)]
*  What about Leon Fetta, John Brennan? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=202.12s)]
*  Exactly. Mike Morrell. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  That letter was instigated by Antony Blinken. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank God, no longer the Secretary of State. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=210.44s)]
*  He was a campaign adviser. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=212.44s)]
*  He calls up former acting director of the CIA, Mike Morrell, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=214.4s)]
*  and gets him to write this letter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=218.36s)]
*  It was a campaign stunt. They all knew it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=219.96s)]
*  They all knew it was to give Joe Biden a talking point [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=223.44s)]
*  in that final debate against Donald Trump, and they lied. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  And so the very least that should happen to them [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  is to get their security clearances stripped now [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=232.8s)]
*  four years later. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  They make money out of those security clearances. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  Keep in mind, that was like the death nail in that story [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=239.56s)]
*  that made it almost impossible to run with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=243.24s)]
*  because 51 intel agents, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=245.12s)]
*  Leon Panetta's not known as a blatant partisan, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=246.84s)]
*  even though he worked for Democratic administrators. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=248.8s)]
*  And you thought to yourself, OK, guess who else was duped by that? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=251.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg was briefed in the summer [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=254.12s)]
*  before the laptop story broke, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=256.56s)]
*  thanks to Rudy Giuliani and the New York Post. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=258.24s)]
*  And when it happened, he goes, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=260.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, just like they told me in the summer. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=261.8s)]
*  I want to continue to find out who the FBI agents [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=263.76s)]
*  that told Zuckerberg that and who the FBI agents [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  that talked to the owner of the computer repair shop [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=269.04s)]
*  and made them seem like the criminals. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  Instead of saying thank you for coming forward, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=274.2s)]
*  we'll look into that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=276.76s)]
*  Absolutely. The same thing with Twitter. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=277.68s)]
*  I mean, the FBI is definitely a part of this deep state cover-up [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=279.68s)]
*  of Joe Biden's corruption. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=283.52s)]
*  And I'm sure that Cash Patel, Pam Bondi, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=285.32s)]
*  John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard will get to the bottom of it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=289.68s)]
*  And by the way, you know who was president during this time? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump. Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=295.44s)]
*  So even before the Bidens were in office [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=296.44s)]
*  and Democrats were in office, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=299.56s)]
*  they had the power of the FBI in many cases. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  They are completely out of control. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=304.24s)]
*  Just unaccountable deep staters. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=306.76s)]
*  And they acted against Donald Trump, his entire first presidency. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=308.96s)]
*  Hopefully it's over. Thanks so much, Miranda Devine. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=312.08s)]
*  Great to see you. Thanks so much. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=314.24s)]
*  It was an exciting time. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJNeoXCXQ9k&t=315.32s)]
