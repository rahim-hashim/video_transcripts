# BULLET-PROOF: Ex-Navy SEAL, wife reveal keys for enduring the marriage ‘mission’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM)
*  A new book is laying out the keys to build a bulletproof relationship. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=0.0s)]
*  Mission Invincible Marriage authors retired Navy SEAL Jason Redmond and his wife with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=6.42s)]
*  nearly 24 years, Erica Redmond join me now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=11.34s)]
*  Good morning to you guys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=14.24s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=15.24s)]
*  So this book is so important. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=17.0s)]
*  I was really surprised by this statistic that 90% of Navy SEALs go through divorces and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=18.2s)]
*  that rate is between 60 and 70 for our first responders and other law enforcement individuals. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=24.66s)]
*  So you guys beat the odds. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=30.32s)]
*  So Jason, tell us how you didn't and how other couples can have what you have right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=31.86s)]
*  I think Eric and I were very intentional about everything in our marriage right from the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=37.74s)]
*  very beginning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=41.08s)]
*  We I said, hey, the SEAL team is a very difficult job. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=42.08s)]
*  I'm going to be gone a lot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=45.58s)]
*  You know, you're going to have to be holding down the household and and running a lot of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=46.82s)]
*  things when I'm gone. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  And oh, by the way, I want to do 20 years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  That's one of my goals. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=54.58s)]
*  And throughout our marriage, we kind of ran our marriage like a mission. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  Hey, this is our mission. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=60.46s)]
*  It's us together. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=62.18s)]
*  But it was always together. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=63.18s)]
*  You know, my goal was to be a SEAL. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  But Erica had her own dreams. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=66.38s)]
*  All of those things together is what enabled us to have success. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=68.98s)]
*  And obviously, that's what this book is about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=72.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=74.98s)]
*  And Erica, you start the book by talking about a few years after Jason was injured. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=75.98s)]
*  And many of our viewers know Jason Jason story. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=80.46s)]
*  It deserves a lot more time than what we have, but severely wounded by machine gunfire to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=83.38000000000001s)]
*  the face and into the arm. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=88.06s)]
*  We thank you so much for your service. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=89.38s)]
*  And what a horrible set of circumstances that was. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=91.28s)]
*  But Erica, you say that life after a few years after that injury and after all of the surgeries [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=93.54s)]
*  were over was really the most difficult time in your marriage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  So tell us about that and how you approach that challenge and give some advice to other [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  couples out there who might be going through a difficult time as well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=109.86s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of people can relate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=111.94s)]
*  A lot of times people are like, oh, my gosh, what you went through was a lot in it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=114.14s)]
*  And it was. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=119.34s)]
*  But we actually navigated that pretty well as a team. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=120.34s)]
*  Jason was pretty positive. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=124.14s)]
*  And it wasn't until a few years later that, you know, our nonprofit was doing good. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=126.24s)]
*  The kids were doing good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=133.04s)]
*  You know, you kind of look around and everything should be doing good. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=134.64s)]
*  But he didn't feel that way. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=137.64s)]
*  And I think a lot of people, you know, in other health crisis is or, you know, other [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=139.64s)]
*  aspects of life can kind of relate to when things are don't seem right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=144.64s)]
*  And thankfully, I think we navigated that time well and we talk about it in the book [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=150.44s)]
*  because we had built a good, strong foundation, because we had trust, because we had good [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=156.04s)]
*  communication when that when that time frame came. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=161.14s)]
*  And I kind of told him, you know, we have to do something. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  We have to it has to change. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  He listened to me because of, you know, because of I think that trust that man and seeing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  you guys look at each other, you still so much in love. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  And I love seeing those younger pictures of you that we're showing on our screen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  But you really hit on something there, Erica, when it comes to communication. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=183.64s)]
*  I mean, man, is that key. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=187.14s)]
*  And oftentimes, Jason, when you get married, it's nothing really changes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=188.44s)]
*  It's like an extension of dating. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=192.44s)]
*  But when you put kids into the mix, that's when things really change. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=194.24s)]
*  And it's really the time when a couple needs to stay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=198.84s)]
*  It's most important that they stay together because you're also dealing with a child. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=201.94s)]
*  So any advice to any young couples out there have young kids of their own that might be [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=205.74s)]
*  going through some things. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we wrote this book and we ran our marriage, like I said, kind of like a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=212.94s)]
*  special operations team and most critical aspect of any military operation, especially [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  for special operations is communication breakdowns and communication can lead to breakdowns [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=223.44s)]
*  and failures and emission. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=228.14s)]
*  And that's no different in a marriage, different phase of your life. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=229.14s)]
*  Carly, you nailed it, whether it's kids or whether it's new jobs or transition or [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=232.54s)]
*  move or whatever it is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=238.44s)]
*  It's critical that we're always communicating and it's always we not me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=240.14s)]
*  We're sharing our dreams. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=244.44s)]
*  We're sharing our challenges and our problems, but we're always it's the center [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=245.84s)]
*  thread throughout. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=250.04s)]
*  It's true, man. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=250.84s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=252.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a marriage is a team and it's the most important team that you'll ever be [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=253.34s)]
*  a part of. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=256.94s)]
*  There are other relationship books out there, but this is unlike any other one out there [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=257.74s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=261.84s)]
*  I mean, using the skills that you the challenges that you went through as a Navy SEAL and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=262.24s)]
*  also the skills that you learned as part of the SEAL teams is going to be such an asset [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=266.94s)]
*  to anybody out there who's going through a marriage or thinking about it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  So Jason, Erica, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnKV4GZYPM&t=275.03999999999996s)]
