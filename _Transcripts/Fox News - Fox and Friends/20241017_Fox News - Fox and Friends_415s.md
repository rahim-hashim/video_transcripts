# Voters in Detroit barbershop hesitant to support Kamala Harris
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw)
*  Kamala Harris visiting Detroit this week and rolling out a new agenda focused on garnering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=0.0s)]
*  support from black men. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=5.08s)]
*  But the polls show Democratic support among black voters since 2020 is actually, as you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=7.3s)]
*  can see right there, slipping. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  So we decided to go to Detroit for our exclusive Barbershop Talks series to see what real Americans [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=15.6s)]
*  have to say. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=21.6s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=22.6s)]
*  As I always say, the barbershop is the center of everything in the community in black America. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=23.6s)]
*  So we start in Detroit, Michigan to figure out what the people are saying on the ground. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=29.58s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=33.78s)]
*  If the election were held today, who would win the election? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=34.78s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  I think it's a coin flip at this time. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  I really do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  I think the country is so divided, you wouldn't have numbers like you have if the country [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  weren't divided between the two counties. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=54.06s)]
*  It's pretty much 50-50. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  I'm still in between myself. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=57.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=59.78s)]
*  There's a lot of decisions have to be made. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=60.78s)]
*  Me being an entrepreneur and a father and a grandfather, I'm looking at what state my [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=63.14s)]
*  children will be in 10 years from now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=69.66s)]
*  At the end of the day, I'm Trump because my eyes open. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=71.42s)]
*  I can see that he was doing a lot better than what we're going through right now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=75.5s)]
*  You can't even go to the grocery stores right now without making a life decision on what [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=81.42s)]
*  you want to get. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=88.06s)]
*  You know, you got to compromise. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=89.06s)]
*  We even had to go through that four years ago. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  You know, just being able to just live on a day-to-day basis, it has become a little [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=94.02s)]
*  harder at this point in time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=97.78s)]
*  It's really hard to put our economic condition now on any particular administration. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=100.26s)]
*  In regards to the economy, I do think that Trump have some benefits as far as bringing, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=109.5s)]
*  keeping our jobs right here, right here in this country, not sending another job overseas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=117.82s)]
*  We're already going through enough crisis right here in our country, and I think the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=124.06s)]
*  working class would need more job security right here in this country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=127.98s)]
*  Who thinks immigration-wise Kamala Harris is better? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=133.06s)]
*  I don't have enough information. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=137.74s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  Who thinks Donald Trump would be better for the border? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  Let's face it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  Individuals are coming into our country, not just illegal, but they're criminals. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=144.62s)]
*  The third issue is crime. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=149.5s)]
*  Who do y'all feel like is the best candidate to handle crime in America? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=150.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris absolutely would be the best. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=154.18s)]
*  We have forgotten. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=156.22s)]
*  The memory is so short right now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=157.22s)]
*  Was it not Vice President Harris who supported what? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=159.38s)]
*  Defund the police? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=163.46s)]
*  More black men voted for Donald Trump than any other Republican ever. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=165.14s)]
*  So why is that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=170.18s)]
*  What is leading toward more support for him versus any other Republican? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=172.7s)]
*  My brother is a firm Donald Trump supporter. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=177.66s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=181.62s)]
*  And some things that he always says to me is that some of his principles as far as abortion, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=182.62s)]
*  as far as same-sex marriage, as far as those things, those are a lot of the sticking points [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  that draw a lot of our black men. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=193.42s)]
*  Sometimes us as brothers, black brothers, we feel like the other is better than we are. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=195.61999999999998s)]
*  To me, that's that slavery mentality, that master is better, and that we want to... [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=204.7s)]
*  Hold on, are you saying that the brothers that... [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=209.7s)]
*  They all come from a different generation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=214.14s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=216.89999999999998s)]
*  Are you saying that the brothers that subscribe to Donald Trump, that feel like he would be [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=217.89999999999998s)]
*  have a slave mentality? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=222.54s)]
*  Many of us do still have a slavery mentality. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm voting for master. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  The problem is whether we vote emotionally. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=228.94s)]
*  That's not smart. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=231.18s)]
*  We need to vote, we need to educate ourselves first. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  We got to stop this emotional because that's what's wrong with the black race. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=235.18s)]
*  We too emotional. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  We can't... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=241.26s)]
*  I can't have an opinion without you being mad at me or something or you upset when I say, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  we should... [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=249.38s)]
*  We got to come together. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=249.9s)]
*  The presidency is not a person. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=251.17999999999998s)]
*  It's an institution to be protected. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  I think we need to get back to that understanding the position, understanding what the intended [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=256.09999999999997s)]
*  job is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=264.02s)]
*  It's not Kamala Harris, it's not Joe Biden, it's not Donald Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=265.46s)]
*  It's the United States of America. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=269.82s)]
*  That was great. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=273.02s)]
*  I want to go to that barber shop. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=274.34s)]
*  It was so much fun. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=276.14s)]
*  As you can see, the tension got up at .7, but it's an authentic conversation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=277.42s)]
*  I left with 50% of them are going to vote for Donald Trump and 50% of them are going [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=282.98s)]
*  to be for Kamala Harris. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=286.78s)]
*  Still some undecided people in there as well, but the one consensus that you continue to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  hear is about the Trump economy, the Trump economy, the Trump economy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=292.74s)]
*  The other thing you hear, at least for some of the people that are going to vote for Kamala [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=296.42s)]
*  Harris, is that they want to be a part of the history of the first black woman being [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=299.46s)]
*  president. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=304.74s)]
*  So there's a balance of economics versus history making going on. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=305.82s)]
*  I think what mattered the most to them, it sounds like, keeping jobs in America and paying [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=310.94s)]
*  for groceries at the grocery store for prices to go down so they would have more money to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=315.22s)]
*  feed their families. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=319.66s)]
*  And then the one guy said about Kamala Harris, I don't have enough information on her stance [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  on immigration. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=325.42s)]
*  How much time do you have? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=326.42s)]
*  We could inform you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=329.06s)]
*  One of the brothers that was in the barbershop is a construction worker. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=330.06s)]
*  He goes, look, I don't want to give Donald Trump credit on this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=334.02000000000004s)]
*  But he goes, when I was in the construction industry, because of what was happening in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=336.7s)]
*  the border when he was cracking down on it, he goes, our wages went up because they weren't [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=340.38s)]
*  allowed to hire, they didn't have the illegals to hire. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  So he goes, I have to give him some credit on that because it did directly impact my [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=350.26s)]
*  job. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's what it's going to come down to as the race settles down. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  We're like almost like getting close to two weeks out, then people are going to make decisions [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=360.54s)]
*  based on how it will impact their day to day lives. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=364.82s)]
*  Well, and the barbershop itself, I bet business is off from the heyday just because people [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=368.38s)]
*  don't have enough money to go and get a haircut, a shave, and they do a shoe shine there too, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=374.38s)]
*  right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  That's 100% right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  It's a traditional barbershop. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  Very respectful, though, even though the conversation got heated sometimes, it was civil and the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  people left hugging, dapping each other up and went right back to work. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=386.7s)]
*  So you did this first time in Chicago. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  Detroit, then we're going to air Atlanta, and then we're going to have a big one in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=394.3s)]
*  the Bronx here in New York as well. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=401.86s)]
*  Good job. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=402.86s)]
*  A lot of fun. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=403.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re7ZzsdiQnw&t=404.86s)]
