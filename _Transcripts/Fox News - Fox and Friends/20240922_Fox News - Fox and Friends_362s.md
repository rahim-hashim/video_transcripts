# Fetterman says PA support for Trump deepened after assassination attempt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw)
*  Made it clear these guys want to instill fear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=0.0s)]
*  They want to tell you that just get over it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=3.52s)]
*  It's a fact of life. This is the way it is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=5.96s)]
*  She simply has said it doesn't have to be this way. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=8.52s)]
*  We can't afford four more years of this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=11.64s)]
*  Tim Walz, sounding like he took a page from the Trump campaign [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=16.16s)]
*  yesterday, as he told Pennsylvania voters, we can't [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=19.2s)]
*  afford four more years of this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=22.32s)]
*  The embarrassing gaffe hitting in the state's ultimate swing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=25.48s)]
*  county where Politico argues, quote, It's likely Walz will [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=29.16s)]
*  have more luck turning out the base in the blue trending [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=33.6s)]
*  suburbs here than trying to sway working class men in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=36.76s)]
*  county that is a mix of historically democratic cities [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=41.24s)]
*  and small town suburbs and deep red rural stretches. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=44.4s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about the importance of this crucial [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=48.0s)]
*  swing state Pittsburgh based columnist Selena Zito joins us [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=50.04s)]
*  now. Good morning, Selena. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=53.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=55.08s)]
*  It strikes us. We're talking about this this morning that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=55.72s)]
*  there's this balance they're trying to strike the Harris [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=57.88s)]
*  Waltz campaign of appearing as though they are hope and fresh [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=60.56s)]
*  and change and something new and painting Donald Trump as the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=64.72s)]
*  incumbent, but also cloaking themselves in experience. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=68.36s)]
*  Hey, you know, I've been vice president. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=70.68s)]
*  Also, Tim Walz trying to appeal to, you know, blue collar men. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  But it seems to be the biggest appeal is with deep blue voters. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=78.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=84.84s)]
*  So the working class vote is up for grab in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=86.32s)]
*  And, you know, Donald Trump did that really, really well in 2016. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=91.08s)]
*  But Joe Biden was able to take just enough away in 2020 because [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  mainly because of his Pennsylvania roots. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=102.52s)]
*  And so they are the voters that have hurt the most in this economy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=105.88s)]
*  They're the ones that drive the most. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=111.28s)]
*  So the gas prices have impacted their family. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=113.32s)]
*  The costs have impacted their family. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=117.36s)]
*  And I think there is a blind spot among the Democratic strategist [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=120.0s)]
*  and among a lot of reporters is that they think of the working class as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=124.44s)]
*  only white. And that's not true. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  Working class Hispanic and working class black voters vote very much the same. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  They don't vote along race. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=137.64s)]
*  That has changed under Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=139.92s)]
*  They now sort of vote shoulder to shoulder because they live in the same [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  communities and they're having the same experiences. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=146.72s)]
*  So I think to Politico's point, Walz would probably be better served in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  trying to gin up the vote in maybe Montgomery County or Chester County [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  and not in Lehigh or Berks or Northampton or Luzerne, where there's more of a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  working class and rural voter concentration. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  It's such a great point about the multiracial working class vote and how [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=169.84s)]
*  they vote shoulder to shoulder and not along racial lines. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=175.04s)]
*  I think Tim Walz appeals more to those ladies with the masks that were scolding [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=177.6s)]
*  people in grocery stores than he does to any of those men who put on boots to go [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  to work in the morning. I want to talk to you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=186.0s)]
*  I want to show you this clip from Fetterman from John Fett, Senator Fetterman [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=188.32s)]
*  about talking about Trump's assassination and its impact on voters in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=197.56s)]
*  Trump has created a special kind of a hold within the corner and he's remade [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=199.12s)]
*  the party and he has a special kind of place in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=205.24s)]
*  And I think that only deepened after that first assassination attempt. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=209.72s)]
*  I also want people to understand, you know, and it's not science, but there is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=214.36s)]
*  there's energy and there's kinds of anger on the ground in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=219.4s)]
*  And people are very committed and strong. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=225.32s)]
*  Trump is going to be strong. And that's we have to respect that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=229.44s)]
*  Sina, I found that to be so interesting because I think that people are seeing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=233.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is willing to risk his life. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=238.64s)]
*  His voters are saying he's willing to risk his life to, you know, run and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  change the country and make it make it make America great again. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=247.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be afraid to tell my neighbor or put a sign in front of my [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=250.4s)]
*  house or finally stand up and say how I feel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=253.48s)]
*  Is that what he's talking about? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=256.68s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and Federman, I've covered him since 2005 for the first time [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=259.32s)]
*  that he ran for mayor in Braddock and he won by one absentee vote. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=263.84s)]
*  Right. And he's always been sort of the guy who goes off what the Democrats [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=269.84s)]
*  would call call the reservation in terms of speaking the truth about things. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=276.08s)]
*  He's always been very blunt. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  And in 2016 or 20, 2016, if you go back and look at an interview I did with him, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  he he understood that bond between the Trump and the voters. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  He understood and we talked about that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  He goes, look, it's very real and my party really needs to pay attention to this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=296.48s)]
*  And so he has understood that for eight years. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm not shocked to hear him say that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=304.32000000000005s)]
*  And there is there has been that sense since Trump was shot here in my home [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  state that, you know, I mean, I don't mean to put it so crassly, but he took a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  bullet. I can put a sign out or I can wear my hat. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=318.8s)]
*  There's less fear of showing where your support is than there has been in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  previous years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=327.72s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=329.32s)]

*  Yeah, I'm always insightful. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=332.2s)]
*  No one knows Pennsylvania better than Selena. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlR99-w4qHw&t=334.08000000000004s)]
