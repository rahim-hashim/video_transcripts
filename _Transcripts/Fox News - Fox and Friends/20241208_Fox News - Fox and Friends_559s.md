# Assad regime overthrown by rebels in Syria
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0)
*  Let's go to Ryan Morrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=0.0s)]
*  He's an investigative researcher of extremist groups [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=0.88s)]
*  and foreign threats at the Capitol Research Center. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=3.88s)]
*  And he joins us now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=6.96s)]
*  Ryan, I'd love to start with the question, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=8.4s)]
*  which you're probably the most qualified [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=9.68s)]
*  to discuss with us this morning, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=11.68s)]
*  and that is, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=12.96s)]
*  understanding who might just be taking over Syria. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=14.84s)]
*  If it is true now that the regime in Syria [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=18.64s)]
*  is turning over, the Assad regime, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=21.2s)]
*  after 24 years is losing power, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=22.64s)]
*  what do we know about the extremist groups [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=24.76s)]
*  who've been waging this campaign now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  for what is it, 12 years, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  and look like they could be taking power in Syria? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=30.84s)]
*  Right, well, the one that's getting the most attention [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=34.28s)]
*  because they're leading the fight in Damascus [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=35.92s)]
*  and taking over places is called HTS. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=38.2s)]
*  It's a Turkey-backed jihadist group [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=41.2s)]
*  that used to be part of Al-Qaeda. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=43.4s)]
*  And the only reason that they're not part of Al-Qaeda [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=45.0s)]
*  is because Al-Qaeda was not so popular [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=47.08s)]
*  with those that it wanted to ally with. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  So you're talking about essentially Al-Qaeda [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=51.08s)]
*  backed by Turkey taking over a large part of Syria anyway. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=53.8s)]
*  Some people are characterizing it as a complete takeover, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=58.28s)]
*  but that's actually not true. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=60.4s)]
*  There are other rebel groups, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=61.96s)]
*  including ones that have long worked with the United States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=63.4s)]
*  There's some that have even worked with Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=66.36s)]
*  So there are alternatives here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=68.68s)]
*  So when we talk about the rebels, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=70.92s)]
*  it's not like a single thing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=72.28s)]
*  You know, one of the things I've been thinking about is, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=75.76s)]
*  what is best for the people in Syria? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=78.6s)]
*  How do we know that this group, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=81.32s)]
*  or some combination of the other rebel groups, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=83.12s)]
*  is going to, in the long run, be better? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  And also, I'm concerned about the Christian minority. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=88.56s)]
*  These are ancient Christian groups. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=92.16s)]
*  Some people say they were better, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=94.56s)]
*  or at least somewhat protected under Assad, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=96.6s)]
*  and that now they'll be exposed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=98.6s)]
*  But then I've seen contradictory things. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=100.28s)]
*  Where does that stand? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=101.88s)]
*  Well, in regards to the Christians, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  which is about 10% of the population, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=106.0s)]
*  there is a divide. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=108.28s)]
*  And there are some that favor Assad's rule, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=109.92s)]
*  not because they love what he's doing to his people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=112.6s)]
*  I mean, it's just horrific. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=114.6s)]
*  The numbers, the torture, it's just unbelievable. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=116.64s)]
*  He's like a supervillain on the worst scale. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=119.08s)]
*  But because they fear that the jihadist rebels [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=122.32s)]
*  are going to try to exterminate them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=125.08s)]
*  Now, HDS, the al-Qaeda-type group, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=127.8s)]
*  is trying to have better PR [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=130.44s)]
*  and be more strategic and diplomatic than al-Qaeda, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=132.68s)]
*  and is saying we're going to protect the Christians. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=136.28s)]
*  We'll see about that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=138.92s)]
*  But really, the only alternative to, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=140.68s)]
*  in this particular scenario that we have, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=143.0s)]
*  because the Assad regime is basically gone, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=144.96s)]
*  is to support groups like the Syrian Democratic Forces, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=148.12s)]
*  which includes a Christian component, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  allied with Sunni Arabs and allied with Kurds. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  And has long worked with the United States [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=156.72s)]
*  and controls most of the oil and gas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=158.52s)]
*  So to me, it seems like that's the most, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  backing them seems to be the most obvious option. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=162.36s)]
*  I don't think that we can take a position [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=165.28s)]
*  of not getting involved because we're already involved. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=167.52s)]
*  We already have military forces operating in Syria. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=170.68s)]
*  And obviously, we're not the only ones involved there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  There are all kinds of proxies that are involved there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=177.44s)]
*  When you look at this sort of big picture overnight, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=181.32s)]
*  can you identify any outside country or group [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  that benefits the most from what's happened [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=190.28s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=192.56s)]
*  and then especially last night? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  Sure, I mean, every adversary of the Iranian regime [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=197.56s)]
*  and what they call the axis of resistance, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=200.4s)]
*  the legion of terrorist groups that Iran sponsors [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  are all hurt by this because they're so dependent [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  on receiving Iranian aid through Syria [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  and aid from the Syrian government directly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=211.56s)]
*  So this is a hellish scenario for the Iran-backed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  terrorist groups and the Iranian regime itself. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=218.17999999999998s)]
*  Therefore, it does benefit Turkey, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  which I think is ultimately to our detriment, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=222.44s)]
*  but it also benefits the US and especially Israel [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=225.0s)]
*  because even though a large chunk of the rebels are jihadists, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Israel basically had a choice. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=232.32s)]
*  They could either have Iran on its border [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=234.52s)]
*  representing a strategic threat [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=235.6s)]
*  because Iran controlled the Assad regime, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=237.08s)]
*  or they can have a more Somalia-type situation [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=240.24s)]
*  where you have all these fighting groups [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=242.84s)]
*  and they're busy fighting each other. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=245.12s)]
*  So that's not a strategic threat. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=247.18s)]
*  It's not the same thing as having an enemy nation [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=248.44s)]
*  against you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=251.0s)]
*  Ryan, I'm curious about what happens next. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=252.16s)]
*  Obviously, as what you laid out, Iran loses. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=256.74s)]
*  They're the biggest loser in this entire equation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=259.32s)]
*  Syria is, I believe I'm correct here, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=262.08s)]
*  population-wise primarily Sunni, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=264.96s)]
*  and these rebel groups are Sunni Muslims. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=266.74s)]
*  That pushes Iran and its Shia Muslim power grip [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=270.24s)]
*  over Syria out. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=273.28s)]
*  But what, you talked about the United States playing a role. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=275.96s)]
*  How do we, I guess we will play a role, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  but how concerned are we that Syria falls down the path [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=281.28s)]
*  of so many other countries who lost a stabilizing force, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  maybe a malevolent force, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=288.36s)]
*  but still a malevolent stabilizing force [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=290.0s)]
*  into what we saw in Iraq? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=292.88s)]
*  Chaos, civil war, ISIS, al-Qaeda, jihadist, terrorism. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=295.28s)]
*  Like how concerned should we be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=301.32s)]
*  that this is the future now for Syria [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=303.1s)]
*  and the potential to blow back on the United States? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=305.24s)]
*  I mean, the consequences, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=309.24s)]
*  negative consequences are very, very real for us to consider [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=311.4s)]
*  because jihadists are recruited and get battle practice [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=315.2s)]
*  in scenarios like this in civil wars. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=319.56s)]
*  Then when the civil war is over, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=321.44s)]
*  jihadists don't just stop the jihad, they look elsewhere. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=323.0s)]
*  For the foreseeable future, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=327.16s)]
*  a lot of that fighting is going to be within Syria, I think. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=328.24s)]
*  I personally do not consider Assad [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=330.48s)]
*  to have been a stabilizing force [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=332.8s)]
*  because he did cultivate these al-Qaeda type elements, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=334.12s)]
*  even as he fought them at times by promoting their ideology. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=337.58000000000004s)]
*  A lot of American soldiers lost their lives in Iraq [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=340.6s)]
*  because Assad was helping the al-Qaeda elements [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  go into Iraq and try to destroy the place. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=345.88s)]
*  So that's kind of the scenarios [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=349.76s)]
*  where these competing radicals [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=352.64s)]
*  and really what the US interest is going to be [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=354.52s)]
*  is going to be similar to what it has been [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=356.84s)]
*  where we've had special forces in there working with Kurds, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=358.56s)]
*  the rebel force I mentioned before, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  in protecting what it can of the oil and the gas [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=364.88s)]
*  and trying to keep down ISIS and stop them from reforming, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  which is a possibility. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=372.56s)]
*  And I think that could expand to trying to counter [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=373.96s)]
*  HTS and the other jihadist rebels [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=377.4s)]
*  because you don't want them to get control [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=379.68s)]
*  of the entirety of Syria and those resources either. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=381.64s)]
*  What kind of risk is there that this destabilization [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=384.96s)]
*  that Will was talking about could expand beyond Syria? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=389.4s)]
*  Are you concerned about that? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=394.44s)]
*  I am. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=397.08s)]
*  I think that there's a strong possibility [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  it could expand into Lebanon because Hezbollah is there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=399.4s)]
*  And I think that the jihadists [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=402.88s)]
*  who have fought this long civil war [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=404.52s)]
*  and the non-jihadists as well against Assad [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=406.32s)]
*  are not going to be too happy with the idea [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=410.4s)]
*  that a lot of these Hezbollah war criminals [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  have gone over to Lebanon. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=415.52s)]
*  So I could see it spilling over to there. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=417.12s)]
*  HTS, I mean, the official name of the organization [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=419.44s)]
*  means the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=422.96s)]
*  which refers to countries outside of Syria, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=426.55999999999995s)]
*  it refers to the whole neighborhood. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  So ideologically, even though they try to make it sound [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=430.24s)]
*  like they're just pure Syrian nationals [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=433.36s)]
*  and that's all they care about, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=435.44s)]
*  it's just a strategic move, it's just PR. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=437.2s)]
*  They, just like the other jihadists, seek a caliphate [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  and so does the Turkish dictator. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=442.92s)]
*  And we have to keep that in mind as Turkey's lobby [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=445.04s)]
*  operates in the United States to try to convince all of us [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=448.08s)]
*  that they and the jihadists they support [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  are some type of moderate solution to the problem. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=452.68s)]
*  So Ryan, over the next week, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=455.72s)]
*  what are you gonna be looking at, big picture wise, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=458.36s)]
*  about, I mean, obviously Israel shares a good border [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=461.36s)]
*  with Syria, are we gonna see tanks rolling into Syria [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=465.04s)]
*  from other countries? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=470.44s)]
*  Are we gonna, what are you looking for over the next week [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=471.72s)]
*  in terms of countries, outside forces, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=474.92s)]
*  trying to help stabilize things? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=477.72s)]
*  Well, there already are Israeli operations going on [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=481.36s)]
*  along that border area right now in order to protect Israel. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=484.6s)]
*  And like I said, it's public information now [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=487.44s)]
*  that Israel's worked with around a dozen rebel groups [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=490.2s)]
*  in order to help protect itself in that part of the area. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=493.48s)]
*  So I don't foresee anyone besides maybe the Turks [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=496.28s)]
*  really getting involved there militarily. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=499.6s)]
*  There's already some fighting between some of the rebel [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=502.08s)]
*  groups and Turkey and its proxies are going to probably [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=504.2s)]
*  want to move very quickly to attack the Syrian [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=507.36s)]
*  democratic forces that are allied with the United States. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=510.44s)]
*  Again, particularly because they hate the Kurds [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=513.24s)]
*  and the Kurds are part of that, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=515.68s)]
*  but there are also Sunni Arabs and Christians [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  who are part of this. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=519.32s)]
*  So we have to keep that in mind as well, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=521.0s)]
*  is that Turkey is an adversary to Christians [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=523.72s)]
*  in Syria as well. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=526.88s)]
*  All right, Ryan Murrow. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=528.7600000000001s)]
*  Really good point. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=529.6s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning, Ryan. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=531.12s)]
*  Insightful stuff. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=533.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  We'll keep that conversation going on [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  throughout the morning. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=536.0s)]
*  This is a big story of the day. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=536.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=537.6600000000001s)]
*  And its repercussions in the region, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=538.5s)]
*  you're asking about, Charlie, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=539.44s)]
*  and in the chaos internally, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=541.24s)]
*  which I know we're both concerned about [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  because of its spillover onto the United States. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=544.2s)]
*  We'll talk about that throughout the morning. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B_NOEe_4L0&t=547.48s)]
