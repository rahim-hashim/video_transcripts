# Hosts perplexed after VP Harris' 'tedious' Oprah event
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g)
*  So last night we heard all about this town hall that Oprah's gonna have. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=0.0s)]
*  She wanted to bring out Kamala Harris and she wanted to introduce her to a town hall [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=4.44s)]
*  and take some questions from the people. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=9.6s)]
*  I had this little bet with Bill Hemmer who joined me on radio and Bill says she grew [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=11.6s)]
*  up a journalist before she was a talk show host. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=15.24s)]
*  She's gonna ask real questions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=18.12s)]
*  Bill, you owe me money because there were no real questions, they were just saves. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=19.8s)]
*  She was a lifeguard. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=25.32s)]
*  She could have been on Baywatch. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=26.32s)]
*  She's press secretary. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=27.32s)]
*  She was on Baywatch saving people from one person from a political death because she [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=28.8s)]
*  kept trying to get her to answer a question but she also opened it by setting the tone [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=33.64s)]
*  by saying this, by going out of her way saying something changed with you the minute Joe [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=38.28s)]
*  Biden stepped out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=42.74s)]
*  What was it? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=43.74s)]
*  Well, I'm just... [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=44.74s)]
*  The veil dropped. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=45.74s)]
*  Yeah, the veil dropped. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=46.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=47.74s)]
*  I haven't seen the veil drop yet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=48.74s)]
*  She said suddenly she felt a certain responsibility. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=50.08s)]
*  And that's kind of the way it went. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=53.58s)]
*  Oprah Winfrey is perhaps one of the preeminent talk show hosts of American television history [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=56.76s)]
*  and so keep in mind she has been an independent politically. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=63.72s)]
*  The only time she really got behind any candidate was in 2007 with Barack Obama. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=69.6s)]
*  No one thinks she's independent. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=73.8s)]
*  She really pushed him at that point and she stayed to the side. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  We never saw her at a convention endorse anybody until this summer when she put everything [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=80.0s)]
*  she's got behind Kamala Harris. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=85.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how you host a town hall type format for two hours after you essentially [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=87.28s)]
*  gave a political endorsement of a candidate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=92.44s)]
*  Well, we know whose side she's on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=95.36s)]
*  On the stage. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  She used to represent that working class woman appealing to the issues that matter to them [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=98.12s)]
*  so she had an opportunity, a question was asked to press her on this question right [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=103.64s)]
*  here, watch. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=108.92s)]
*  We really would love to know what your plan is to help lower the cost of living. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=110.92s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, thank you both for being here and yours is a story I hear around the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=115.84s)]
*  country as I travel and in terms of both rightly having the right to have aspirations and dreams [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=124.12s)]
*  and ambitions for your family and working hard and finding that the American dream is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  for this generation and so many recently far more elusive than it's been and we need to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=144.64s)]
*  deal with that and there are a number of ways. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=150.72s)]
*  One is bringing down the cost of everyday necessities including groceries. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=153.42s)]
*  So that's why I'm taking on, for example, price gouging, which is when most companies [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=157.72s)]
*  and corporations are good, but for those bad ones, they take advantage of people, especially [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=164.76s)]
*  during a pandemic or extreme weather and they end up jacking up prices. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=169.2s)]
*  You know what I realize? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=173.2s)]
*  The truth doesn't matter because the truth is inflation is high. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=175.08s)]
*  That's why prices are up under Barack, I mean under Barack, under Biden and under Kamala [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=179.44s)]
*  Harris's presidency and interest rates are high. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=185.24s)]
*  They did go down, you know, 50 basis points, but not as low as they were under Donald Trump [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=189.8s)]
*  when they were 2.44 percent. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=194.48s)]
*  People can't have the American dream like they used to under President Trump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=196.84s)]
*  But if they hate Donald Trump so much that they put on these shows, they bring in all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=201.28s)]
*  these celebrities, which I don't think helps. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=206.24s)]
*  I think actually it hurts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=208.24s)]
*  Julia Roberts, she zoomed in, Bryan Cranston, Chris Rock, Meryl Streep and others as well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=210.0s)]
*  And those are the coastal elites. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=217.64s)]
*  Those are the celebrities that no one can relate to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Oprah's a billionaire. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=221.6s)]
*  You know, people in that audience behind her are struggling because of these high prices. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  It's all smoke and mirrors though. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=227.56s)]
*  This is all propaganda to make you think that Kamala Harris is going to be a great candidate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=228.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, if you look at her voting record, she is so progressive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=232.96s)]
*  She wants to take money from hardworking Americans so that everyone's equal, everyone makes the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=235.96s)]
*  same amount of money. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=241.08s)]
*  But look at her response though. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=242.08s)]
*  I mean, every time she speaks, I leave dizzy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=244.0s)]
*  She just speaks in circles. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=247.8s)]
*  Takes so long. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=249.88s)]
*  I mean, like, it's one thing I cannot say. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=250.92s)]
*  Make your point and get out of it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=253.32s)]
*  Just one, two, move. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  And she just doesn't have the ability to just let us know point A, point B, this is what [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=257.52s)]
*  I'm going to do. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Make your life better and move on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  Keep in mind, she has the job already. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=267.32s)]
*  If she knew how to bring prices down, she would have done it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=269.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=271.08s)]
*  Number two is the price gouging. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=272.36s)]
*  She's shown no proof of any price gouging and she took at least a minute and a half to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=273.64s)]
*  get to price gouging. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=277.96s)]
*  I understand, acknowledge the question and answer the question, but you're acknowledging [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  the question because you have no answer to the question. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=283.8s)]
*  That was it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  It was so tedious to watch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  And then you think when the celebrities came on, they would say something. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=289.48s)]
*  I know, it's crazy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=292.48s)]
*  They would say something of substance. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=293.72s)]
*  Oh, they says, I feel joy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=295.0s)]
*  I feel happy now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=297.24s)]
*  You know what that is more of a hit on? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=299.12s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=300.44s)]
*  I'm so glad Joe Biden is not going to be president. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=301.44s)]
*  Chris Rock said, I want to be able to take my little girls to the White House to meet [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=303.64s)]
*  the first female black president. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=306.64s)]
*  And I'm like, well, you're a celebrity. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=308.76s)]
*  You have that opportunity to go to the White House and take your little girls. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=310.52s)]
*  Yeah, meanwhile, the other black kids are struggling. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=313.11999999999995s)]
*  Can't read and write in many of our communities. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  Have to deal with the legal just taking over the communities, the rec centers and all that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  So all these people have the luxury to have joy because the economy is not impacting them [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=321.32s)]
*  on the same level. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, the whole idea behind this is because Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are only going [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=328.0s)]
*  to do the one debate. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=333.44s)]
*  She's not really going to do any interviews with real news people, although you made the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=335.12s)]
*  point or Brian, you made the point with Bill Hemmer. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=340.44s)]
*  She used to be a reporter. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=343.36s)]
*  She was a reporter in Baltimore. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=344.36s)]
*  But she was there as an activist to try to prop her up because what the campaign is trying [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=347.36s)]
*  to do is they're trying to get the people who are persuadable right now. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=352.92s)]
*  According to the new Fox News poll, the people who support Trump and Kamala Harris, only [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=356.16s)]
*  of them are movable, but there are there's a tiny little sliver in the middle that are [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  undecided. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's why they're trying to do this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=368.12s)]
*  It's unconventional because this was all streaming. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  So it's they're obviously going after kids who watch everything on the phone. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=373.0s)]
*  The New York Times just dropped a story that says, and this goes to the point about how [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=377.56s)]
*  important your phone is and the online stuff. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=381.68s)]
*  The week of the debate, the Kamala Harris campaign outspent Trump 20 to one buying ads [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=385.34s)]
*  on Facebook and Instagram. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=392.88s)]
*  The whole idea was to say, essentially, we've got a lot of money and we're going to try [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  to get the message out. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=399.58s)]
*  She's this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  And so they're presenting a certain image and there's a lot of feelings, but not a lot [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  of facts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=406.76s)]
*  So she also talked about something else. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=408.44s)]
*  Yeah, she talked about that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  We know she has a gun. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=412.29999999999995s)]
*  She said that when she was asked about the mandatory buyback thing at the debate. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=413.56s)]
*  You want to buy back everyone's guns, you're going to make everyone turn over their guns. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=418.32s)]
*  And she said, no, no, no, Tim has guns. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=422.18s)]
*  Her vice president and I have a gun. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=424.9s)]
*  So we learned more about that and what she plans to do with her gun if someone breaks [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=427.72s)]
*  in her house. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=432.32s)]
*  Listen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=433.32s)]
*  I'm a gun owner. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=434.32s)]
*  Tim has a gun. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=435.32s)]
*  I did not know that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=436.32s)]
*  And somebody breaks in my house again shot. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=437.32s)]
*  Yes, yes, I hear that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=442.32s)]
*  I hear that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=445.56s)]
*  Probably should not have said that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=446.56s)]
*  But my staff will deal with that later. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=450.28s)]
*  They deal with everything. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  They always clean up the mess. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  This whole campaign has been run by staff, but even Oprah, who's been genuine, she goes, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=457.8s)]
*  I did not know that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=464.92s)]
*  No one knows that you've been district attorney, you've been attorney general, and you've been [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=466.52s)]
*  There has been no ads ever cut of Kamala Harris saying that she has a gun. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=470.76s)]
*  Well, she has talked in the past about guns and talked about the need to keep it in a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=476.16s)]
*  safe place. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=481.32s)]
*  Let's listen to the DA Kamala Harris talk about what happens, what police should be [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=482.84s)]
*  doing for gun owners. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=489.1s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=490.36s)]
*  We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=491.36s)]
*  Just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=496.92s)]
*  that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=502.56s)]
*  and safe in the way you conduct your affair. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=506.48s)]
*  OK, so that was that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  It's going to barge into your house. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  This is now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=512.32s)]
*  So last night she talked about how she and the vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=513.32s)]
*  both have guns. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=517.64s)]
*  Interesting tidbit. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=519.96s)]
*  Apparently, Tim Walz is doing debate prep. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=520.96s)]
*  And do you know who is preparing him? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=523.72s)]
*  Explain. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=526.08s)]
*  Buttigieg. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=527.08s)]
*  Buttigieg, exactly. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=528.08s)]
*  And who did Buttigieg work up before? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=529.08s)]
*  Worked with Kamala Harris when it was time to debate Mike Pence. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=532.1600000000001s)]
*  I think her flip flops just show she knows she has to be more of a moderate. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=534.88s)]
*  She has to paint herself more as a moderate. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  We know she's not. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=541.32s)]
*  We know she's progressive. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=542.32s)]
*  Bernie Sanders says she's progressive. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=543.32s)]
*  She's just being pragmatic so that she can win this election. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=545.0s)]
*  She is not a moderate. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=547.64s)]
*  Look at her voting record. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=548.96s)]
*  I think now she's saying no tax on tips because she stole that from Donald Trump. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=549.96s)]
*  She knows that that was a winning message especially for Nevada and people that work [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=554.44s)]
*  in the industry, food industry and beverage industry. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  Then she also said mandatory buyback on your guns. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=560.82s)]
*  Then she flip flopped on that to sound more like President Trump. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=563.7s)]
*  You can keep your guns. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=566.58s)]
*  In fact, I have a gun. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=567.58s)]
*  And then she said no fracking. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=568.7s)]
*  Now she's saying you can frack, sounding like Donald Trump. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=570.72s)]
*  And then here she's saying if you break in my house, I'll shoot you like a lot of Americans [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=573.5s)]
*  would do. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=577.36s)]
*  But it's also such, it's such nonsense. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=578.36s)]
*  First of all, she has secret service, okay? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=580.36s)]
*  They're going to be the people that do it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=583.28s)]
*  Don't pretend to the American people. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=585.12s)]
*  You think people at home really think that Kamala Harris is going to be the person wielding [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=586.4s)]
*  the gun if someone breaks in her. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=590.24s)]
*  Hopefully they do a better job than they've been doing with Donald Trump though and they [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=592.4s)]
*  stop the person from even going to the perimeter. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=595.6s)]
*  So I just don't believe her. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=598.12s)]
*  I like to know the gun. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=601.24s)]
*  How long she's trained with the gun. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=602.44s)]
*  Because you've got to learn to train with the gun. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=603.6s)]
*  You can't just have a gun. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=604.88s)]
*  I thought the responsible thing to do. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=605.88s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=608.16s)]
*  There's a story in Politico today that says that she does not talk about manufacturing [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=609.9599999999999s)]
*  in those blue states, in Michigan, in Ohio, and in Pennsylvania. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  And that could be a huge detriment. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=617.04s)]
*  The other problem she's having is, you know those uncommitteds that showed up not to vote [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=618.6s)]
*  for Joe Biden to vote uncommitted? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=623.0s)]
*  They have not committed to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=625.6s)]
*  They said they have not gotten the answers that they want. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  And that could affect in Michigan, in Arizona, in North Carolina, in Wisconsin. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=630.36s)]
*  Now you have no uncommitted line. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=635.48s)]
*  You could just leave it blank. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=638.12s)]
*  But there is an uncommitted line in Nevada. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=639.92s)]
*  So if you're going to say, if you're angry about the Israeli Gaza situation and are not [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=642.84s)]
*  happy with her agreeing to an embargo, you are staying with uncommitted. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=648.08s)]
*  That is a huge boon for President Trump. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=653.5s)]
*  Well actually, uncommitted national said, we still oppose Donald Trump and we don't [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=655.6s)]
*  encourage anybody to vote third party. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  So it sounds like they're just saying, don't vote. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see what happens. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=665.88s)]
*  There's an option to vote uncommitted. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=667.88s)]
*  They're being urged to vote uncommitted. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=669.1600000000001s)]
*  At this time our movement cannot endorse Vice President Harris. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=676.08s)]
*  And I think too, a lot of people are going to say, we should not give them the answers. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=677.08s)]
*  But I tell you what, you're going to hate Trump's answer because he was yesterday speaking [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=680.72s)]
*  to a Jewish American group and he was letting everybody know, I've been the best friend [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=684.24s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=689.48s)]
*  I don't even think Trump's critics would say that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=690.48s)]
*  And I can't believe that if you're an American of Jewish faith that you would not vote for [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=692.6s)]
*  me. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=698.16s)]
*  He says right now he's only got 40% of the Jewish vote because how could I not have [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=699.16s)]
*  100? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rVbDfRJ1g&t=702.12s)]
