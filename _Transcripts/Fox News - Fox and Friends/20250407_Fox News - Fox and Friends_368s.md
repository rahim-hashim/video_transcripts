# ‘THEY LIED’: Hosts react to new revelations of Dems’ Biden coverup
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY)
*  So the other big story that's happening right now is a story that we find, I find befuddling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=0.0s)]
*  and fascinating and it gets me angry. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now everyone's realizing that we had a cognitive, I have a lot of feelings, Charlie. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=8.8s)]
*  We had a cognitively impaired president for four years who did almost nothing during his [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=15.22s)]
*  time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=20.8s)]
*  The legislation that was passed, the things that were done came up from the Congress where [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=21.8s)]
*  other people, he'd show up for the signing and often he'd screw that up by statements [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=25.16s)]
*  he said at the signing on bills. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=29.18s)]
*  And now we're realizing, now all of a sudden reporters, and I don't put Jonathan Allen [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=31.5s)]
*  in that category, saying, because he says, I used to write about this, I got huge pushback [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  from the administration. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=40.0s)]
*  So the whole thing of Joe Biden being in office for four years, being unable to do the job [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=41.54s)]
*  while working more than two hours a day, is being confirmed by a myriad of books and reporters [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=47.34s)]
*  who finally found the courage to write it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  Now all of a sudden people are even going to the next step and asking the people they're [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  going to know about it to comment on it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=58.46s)]
*  So it's going to sound a little bit like deja vu for a lot of our viewers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=60.9s)]
*  If you watch our show. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=63.74s)]
*  Because if you watch our show, you knew all of this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=65.22s)]
*  And we all got absolutely excoriated when we were asking these questions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=68.3s)]
*  And we were just asking questions like, gee, he doesn't seem right. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=73.38s)]
*  He seems a little out of it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=76.54s)]
*  And they're like, how dare you question his mental capacity. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=77.94s)]
*  But now, and I think one of the things that we're finding out is that Democrats are starting [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=82.88s)]
*  to realize that they actually did profound credibility damage for the party. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=87.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=94.74s)]
*  Well, and remember after the disastrous debate, Tim Walz was asked if he was fit for office. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=95.74s)]
*  And he said the debate was a bad performance, but it doesn't impact what I believe he's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  delivering. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=105.94s)]
*  Well, now they're kind of changing their story. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=106.94s)]
*  He didn't want to answer the question when Jake Tapper asked him if they made a mistake [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=108.8s)]
*  for failing to acknowledge Joe Biden was not up for the job. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=113.42s)]
*  And he didn't want to answer it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=116.9s)]
*  And then he was pressed again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=118.5s)]
*  And this is what he said. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=119.84s)]
*  And also Adam Schiff was asked about it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Don't you think your party needs to acknowledge that President Biden was not up for the job [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=124.34s)]
*  of running for reelection and that this was a major mistake? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=129.46s)]
*  He made that decision. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=133.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=134.34s)]
*  But you all went along with the idea that he was up for it and he wasn't. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=135.34s)]
*  And everybody saw it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=138.9s)]
*  And the country rejected it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=139.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=142.5s)]
*  Well, I look, history will tell us to go back on that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=143.5s)]
*  That very well could be the case, Jake. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=146.94000000000003s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is learning from those lessons. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=148.62s)]
*  I would hope we would never do it again. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=151.3s)]
*  It's hard for me to gauge what the closest advisors to the president were seeing at the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=158.38000000000002s)]
*  I can only speak to the interactions that I had with him, which were in the months leading [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=159.38000000000002s)]
*  up to his getting out of the race, largely ceremonial occasions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=169.06s)]
*  He made the decision to get out of the race. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  I think that was the right decision. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=173.02s)]
*  OK, a couple of things. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=174.5s)]
*  Tim Walz was Joe Biden's defender up until the time he dropped out. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=175.82s)]
*  He was on with Shannon Bream a week before saying this guy has never been better. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=179.66s)]
*  So he's lying. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=184.98s)]
*  That long pause was him. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=186.82s)]
*  Should I act like a knucklehead? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=189.22s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=190.22s)]
*  And say exactly what I'm thinking, which he calls himself. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=191.22s)]
*  And then for Adam Schiff says, I only had a couple of interactions with the president, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=193.34s)]
*  mostly ceremonial. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  You don't have any sources in the White House that would tell you the president's asleep [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  during the day. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=202.74s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=203.74s)]
*  He's got name cards for his own cabinet and doesn't have any idea what's going on with [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=204.74s)]
*  the election. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=210.02s)]
*  So and he's got and Joe Biden's family on top of that allowed this to happen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=211.02s)]
*  So you have all these books coming out and they are not according to sources. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=214.88s)]
*  They are the sources. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  They are going right to the people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=221.62s)]
*  And these people are saying it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  And if they weren't telling the truth that they misquoted, Barack Obama would be out [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  and about, George Clooney would be out and about. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  They know. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  They know what happened behind the scenes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  You've seen Jonathan Allen all over our network. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  He wrote the book. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  It's called Fight. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  And he talks about interviewing different people behind the scenes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=237.42s)]
*  Some of the leaders. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  He talked about how Joe Biden had to wear makeup when he went on trips, foreign trips. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  And that was what he had to do first. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=245.22s)]
*  He had to get his makeup done. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=246.98s)]
*  Sometimes he was late because he was doing his makeup to try to cover up his age. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=248.38s)]
*  But he looked so handsome when he was done with his makeup. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  They talked about how Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi did not want him to run for reelection. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  All this is coming out after after they lied to the American people. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=259.22s)]
*  Here's Jonathan Allen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  The state directors in these big important swing states for months were not seeing internal [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=265.1s)]
*  polling before even before the Biden Trump debate. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  The campaign leadership was not telling the people on the ground where the race stood. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=274.86s)]
*  And the reason for that, the biggest reason for that was that Trump was already beating [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  Biden and the leadership of the Democratic Party, the most senior Democrats were aware [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  of that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=289.02s)]
*  It's one of the reasons that they wanted Biden to debate Trump early. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=290.02s)]
*  They wanted so badly to shake up a race that Trump was already going to win, looking for [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=292.58s)]
*  a way to shake it up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  And they did shake it up, just not in the way they hoped. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  Look, if they had any courage after the midterm, the worst thing to happen to the Democratic [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  Party was them to do well in that midterm election when they barely won the House, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  kept McCarthy and they thought and they held the Senate. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  He go, look, they like me. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=312.82s)]
*  I got to Afghanistan. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=314.26s)]
*  All you Republicans made too big a deal of it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=315.26s)]
*  I'm running for your election. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=317.74s)]
*  Nobody said a word. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=319.34s)]
*  And maybe they were going, yeah, he's bad, but we're running it for him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=320.34s)]
*  We could do this some more. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=323.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, if they were being honest and cared about the country, they would say, Jill, you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=324.26s)]
*  got to talk to him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, we got to make this like a good landing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  You got to make this open process. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=332.78s)]
*  Nobody but Kamala Harris. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=335.78s)]
*  It's your turn to talk, but really quickly, I think that I think they they were what was [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=338.06s)]
*  going through their mind is he beat Donald Trump before. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYf2Flpr3UY&t=345.86s)]
