# Reagan air traffic control tower reportedly understaffed at time of crash
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo)
*  All right, start with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=0.0s)]
*  Search crews are returning to the Potomac River this morning [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=2.6s)]
*  to look for more aircraft components [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=6.16s)]
*  after the deadly midair collision [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  near Reagan National Airport. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=10.08s)]
*  And the NTSB are now working to extract data [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=11.68s)]
*  from the black boxes recovered from the passenger jet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=15.76s)]
*  Mark Meredith is live at the Potomac River [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=18.84s)]
*  and the Potomac Park with the details. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=20.96s)]
*  Mark. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=23.0s)]
*  Brian, Lawrence and Ainsley, good morning, friends. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=25.48s)]
*  Investigators say where there are a lot of possible [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=27.52s)]
*  causes to this midair collision. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=29.64s)]
*  At this point, it's simply too early to know for sure [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=31.32s)]
*  what would have led to this crash. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=34.56s)]
*  And it's likely gonna be at least a month [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=35.92s)]
*  before we get a preliminary report. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=37.44s)]
*  As you mentioned today, we expect divers to return out [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=39.32s)]
*  to the crash site that we had patrol boats out there [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=41.92s)]
*  all night long, keeping an eye on this wreckage. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=44.36s)]
*  And they're even gonna start trying to remove [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  some of this debris. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=48.36s)]
*  And while we are gonna have to wait for that report [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=49.6s)]
*  to know where the investigation is heading, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=51.64s)]
*  one possible factor they're looking at is whether or not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=53.78s)]
*  there was adequate staffing at the control tower [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=56.42s)]
*  at Reagan National at the time of the crash. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=58.44s)]
*  The Associated Press getting a hold of an internal report [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=60.68s)]
*  from the FAA that night, which seemed to suggest [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  there may have been staffing issues. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=66.2s)]
*  The report saying the position configuration [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  was not normal for this time of day and volume of traffic, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=70.1s)]
*  indicating that they were looking at whether or not [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=73.68s)]
*  there were enough people there at the time [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=75.6s)]
*  the crash occurred. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=77.8s)]
*  But we have not again heard a definitive answer [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=79.44s)]
*  from the NTSB about that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=81.8s)]
*  Flight tracking app showed the American Airlines [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=83.66s)]
*  Regional Jet was just between two and 400 feet. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  It was only seconds away from landing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=88.44s)]
*  and had been coming in from Wichita, Kansas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=90.04s)]
*  There are unconfirmed reports that the helicopter involved [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=92.0s)]
*  may have been flying off its approved flight plan, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  but that's still part of this investigation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=97.16s)]
*  and nothing confirmed at this point. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  Overnight we learned investigators have recovered [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  the black box as well as the cockpit data recorder, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  voice recorder, on board the Regional Jet American Flight [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=106.28s)]
*  5342. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  They're now in a government lab for evaluation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=109.92s)]
*  We are already seeing some cancellations [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  at Reagan National for today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=114.44s)]
*  Yesterday there was something like 500 flights canceled. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  As of this morning at this hour, guys, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=118.24s)]
*  about 60 flights canceled, but some aircraft are coming in. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=119.96s)]
*  So things are still getting back to normal, if you will, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=123.12s)]
*  new and normal here as we learn more [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=125.44s)]
*  about the investigation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=127.4s)]
*  No news yet of any news conferences as of this morning, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  but that can certainly change [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=131.52s)]
*  and we'll let you know as it does. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=132.68s)]
*  Ainsley, Lawrence, and Brian. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  So Mark, can you confirm some of the reporting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=135.62s)]
*  that's been put out there? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=137.52s)]
*  Apparently the organization as a whole [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=138.52s)]
*  only has a third of the positions that are filled [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=141.8s)]
*  and then you had the person that was responsible [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=144.68s)]
*  for getting them in. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  They were doing two jobs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  So is it the fact is that normally there's an air traffic [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  controller that handles the helicopters [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=154.8s)]
*  and one that handles the airplane? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  That's correct, Lawrence. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=160.4s)]
*  That's our understanding is that normally [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=161.24s)]
*  there would be two different people in that position [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  so that depending on the time of the evening, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  that that one could go down to one position. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=167.36s)]
*  As the evening goes on, air traffic dwindles, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=169.6s)]
*  fewer flights are coming and going. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  Now DC is in an odd spot because we have air traffic [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=173.92s)]
*  from military, we've got security helicopters [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=176.76s)]
*  going through all hours of the day and night. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=179.56s)]
*  So you're also asking about staffing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's been a shortage [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  of air traffic controllers now for years. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=185.2s)]
*  That's not necessarily a new problem to have, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=186.88s)]
*  but whether or not there was still the appropriate staffing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=189.68s)]
*  inside the tower at the time is what they're looking at. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=191.78s)]
*  And the NTSB was asked point blank about this just yesterday [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=194.2s)]
*  and they simply said that they have to review the logs, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=197.34s)]
*  that there is still stuff that they'd have to go back [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=199.78s)]
*  but they didn't want to say definitively [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  that would be the problem. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=203.3s)]
*  And likely, and I've heard this from multiple [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=204.5s)]
*  accident investigators, that there's not gonna be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=206.86s)]
*  just one cause, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=208.88s)]
*  It's not just that there was this one issue [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  and that led to something. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=211.9s)]
*  There was a multitude of likely issues that came up [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=212.86s)]
*  and developed into this situation as tragic as it is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=215.3s)]
*  The one thing I have not heard, and I could have missed it, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=218.22s)]
*  I know it's constantly changing, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=220.9s)]
*  no one is looking at the American airline jet, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=222.82s)]
*  the regional jet and saying, well, you are at fault. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=226.62s)]
*  I mean, of all the scenarios, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  I've heard not even speculation on that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  I felt like they were helpless. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  They're in the flight path, they're doing what they're told. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=235.78s)]
*  About to land. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=238.06s)]
*  And then, yeah, about to land. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=238.9s)]
*  I don't sense, I feel as though [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  they were just victims here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=242.62s)]
*  Well, Brian, we also know that that runway [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  that they were directed to, a shorter runway, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=248.02s)]
*  was a little bit different than the other traffic [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=250.06s)]
*  that had been using. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=251.86s)]
*  I mean, these runways here intersect at Reagan National [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  and so there was a last minute change to a different runway. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=255.94s)]
*  Now, so they were gonna have to wait definitively [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=259.78s)]
*  to say whether or not that also could have contributed [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=262.22s)]
*  to this and you're right, we're not necessarily hearing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=264.18s)]
*  a bunch of people point fingers [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=266.1s)]
*  at the American Airlines regional jet here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=267.38s)]
*  We do have some people that are speculating [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=270.18s)]
*  that it is the military aircraft, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=272.14s)]
*  but it's still speculation, Brian. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=274.0s)]
*  And as officials said repeatedly, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=276.02s)]
*  they've gotta take time here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=277.82s)]
*  They don't wanna say this one way or the other [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=278.98s)]
*  because of course, if you say they think this now, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=280.62s)]
*  then that becomes the working theory [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=282.88s)]
*  and that's how they go off of it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=284.24s)]
*  The NTS base says within 30 days, so it'll be quick. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=285.42s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much, Mark. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, they recovered the cockpit voice recorder [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  and the flight data recorder. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=292.22s)]
*  There was a lawsuit filed last year that alleged [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  that the FAA turned away nearly 1,000 [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=296.98s)]
*  air traffic control applicants solely based on race. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  Was this a DEI thing? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  I was watching Sean's show last night [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  and he was talking about under Obama, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=307.26s)]
*  the FAA launched a national outreach program for DEI [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=309.06s)]
*  that included a push to hire workers [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=312.54s)]
*  with severe intellectual disabilities [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=315.12s)]
*  and psychiatric problems. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=317.42s)]
*  Did that come into play here? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=319.3s)]
*  I just don't understand, how could they be so stupid? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=320.62s)]
*  Especially at one of the business airports. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=323.46s)]
*  And you know, the biggest indicator for me, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=325.78s)]
*  typically when there is a tragedy, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=328.18s)]
*  we lose American lives, you know, the tone is more somber. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=330.02s)]
*  When Sean Duffy went into that press briefing room, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=334.68s)]
*  he was furious. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=337.02s)]
*  I go, Sean knows something that we don't know. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=338.42s)]
*  And as the reporting has started to come out, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=340.36s)]
*  how could you have two people doing that job [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=343.32s)]
*  when you got a helicopter? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  One person doing the job of two. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=346.8s)]
*  Exactly, one person doing the job of two people. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=347.68s)]
*  That makes absolutely, I mean, maybe you can get away [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  with it in the country area where there's not that many [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=352.76s)]
*  planes and air traffic going on there, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=355.2s)]
*  but it's already a complicated airspace [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=357.2s)]
*  and you're more focused on diversity [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=359.88s)]
*  than getting the positions filled. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=363.2s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=364.92s)]
*  So I think this CNN just spent all night last night [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  focusing on what Donald Trump came out and said, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=368.32s)]
*  DEI is probably at the root of this, just to paraphrase. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=369.79999999999995s)]
*  And he said, why are you bringing it up now? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=373.0s)]
*  Well, fundamentally, it might be at the root of this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=374.44s)]
*  and this is moving at a breakneck pace. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=376.28s)]
*  When they're gonna get used to the fact [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=378.4s)]
*  that we have a president that says what exactly he's thinking [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  and he is a leader, but he's saying, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=383.08s)]
*  he also knows a lot about travel, buys planes, right? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  He's been flying on planes since 1980s. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=388.84s)]
*  He actually knows pilots, they become his friends. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=391.0s)]
*  He's also been on choppers constantly [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=393.32s)]
*  because of the previous focus on Atlantic City [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  coming from New York. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  And I'm gonna add something else. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=399.76s)]
*  Air traffic controller has been a problem [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  since before the pandemic and then it got worse. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=402.2s)]
*  How could you be transportation secretary, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg, and not make that your focus? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=407.0s)]
*  And now he's upset that Donald Trump called him out [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=409.4s)]
*  in the previous administration out. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=411.68s)]
*  He was a disaster as a transportation secretary. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=413.24s)]
*  And this has to be the number one, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=416.32s)]
*  if there's something good to come out of this, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  you have to get more air traffic controllers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  They burn out so quick, it is so stressful. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=422.32s)]
*  Well, and when you're on a plane, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=424.56s)]
*  you don't know what's happening behind the scenes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=426.08s)]
*  You buy your ticket, you strap in, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=427.76s)]
*  and you just hope that whoever's running [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=429.92s)]
*  the air traffic control tower is not preoccupied. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=431.96s)]
*  You hope that every position is filled exactly [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=435.92s)]
*  because you put your life literally in their hands. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=439.68s)]
*  And we're not saying that we don't know [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=442.32s)]
*  if this was the problem. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=443.64s)]
*  There's just a report that just- [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=445.28s)]
*  It's just a fundamental problem. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=446.44s)]
*  The control tower staffing at Reagan National Airport [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=447.8s)]
*  was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=449.96s)]
*  Washington Post said they had a near miss [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=452.64s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=454.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=455.24s)]
*  New York Times has series of them as well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=456.08s)]
*  They have 19 near misses across our country in 2023. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGfNFGhmmo&t=458.28s)]
