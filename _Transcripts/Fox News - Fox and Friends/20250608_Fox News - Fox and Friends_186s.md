# Hero Jewish NY firefighter rescues Torah from fire
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk)
*  This morning a Jewish firefighter insists he's no hero despite running into a burning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=0.0s)]
*  Long Island synagogue to rescue a sacred Torah scroll from the flames as petrified congregants [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=7.8s)]
*  watched from outside while praying for a miracle. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=14.4s)]
*  That hero firefighter, Michael Farca joins us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=19.48s)]
*  What an incredible story and obviously the picture of you after you rescued the Torah [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  has sort of shot all the way all around the internet. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=29.84s)]
*  Tell us about that moment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=33.08s)]
*  The moment of the picture was well into an operation and you know we don't really think [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=36.12s)]
*  about it in moments but you wake up in the morning you have a cup of coffee and the alarm [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=40.96s)]
*  goes off and you just respond. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=45.64s)]
*  You know we get onto a scene and you see heavy smoke coming from a building and all you can [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=49.68s)]
*  think is okay how are we going to attack this? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  As part of the truck team which is second due truck on the scene we were in charge [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=58.68s)]
*  of access, opening doors, making sure we have ventilation, ladders, egress, things like that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=64.64s)]
*  We start attacking the fire on the first floor from the outside and we make our way inside [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  to do some searches on the second floor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=79.84s)]
*  We cleared out that first floor which is really more of an entryway and into the lobby. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=82.3s)]
*  Once all that was done, we're talking about a half hour into the operation once that picture [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  was taken and we went into the basement and I was instructed to take a door that was locked [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=91.24s)]
*  because you need to search for fire and that's what we're doing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  There were reports of fire in the area, heavy smoke and we had trouble taking that door [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  at first but most people called me a little stubborn and I didn't want to give up on that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=105.72s)]
*  door. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  There's really no signage. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  We had no idea that there was a synagogue inside. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  This is a tax payer building, seven or eight stores that are there and we're just going [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=116.24s)]
*  in, it's a beauty salon, a jewelry store. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  We don't know what's going on in that basement. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=123.32s)]
*  But you immediately recognized at that point once you got through that door that this was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=125.36s)]
*  a synagogue? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=129.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=130.64s)]
*  They're Jewish, this is great. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=131.64s)]
*  Orthodox community, Roslyn Synagogue is my temple and you recognize it right away. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=133.4s)]
*  You see the pews, I see the ark. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=140.44s)]
*  My instinct really was just to open that ark, see if there was a Torah inside and sure enough [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=143.34s)]
*  there was. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=148.86s)]
*  I clutched that, grabbed that in and took it out. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=149.86s)]
*  Obviously incredibly meaningful for that community, great heroism by you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=154.18s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your story with us, Michael. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=158.34s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=160.22s)]
*  Good to have a Jewish firefighter who knew exactly what to do in that moment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=161.22s)]
*  I love the story. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=164.86s)]
*  That's right, awesome stuff. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=165.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwXuvFZ6Gk&t=166.86s)]
