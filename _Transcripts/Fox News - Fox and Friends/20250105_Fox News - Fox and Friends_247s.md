# 'HISTORIC': Republicans hold closed-door meeting to discuss Trump 'overhaul'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY)
*  House Republicans holding a weekend strategy session looking ahead to President-elect Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=0.0s)]
*  new term as Speaker Johnson reveals Trump favors a conservative policy overhaul in one [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=5.32s)]
*  sweeping package. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=11.6s)]
*  Joining us now with more from that meeting is GOP Congresswoman Claudia Tenney. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=13.36s)]
*  Congresswoman, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=17.36s)]
*  So you've had a fun week. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=19.36s)]
*  You all had some drama on Friday, but you came up with a speaker. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=21.88s)]
*  And then you all met privately off campus yesterday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=26.22s)]
*  What tell us about that meeting and what you all arrived at? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=31.38s)]
*  Well, I thought it was a tremendous meeting. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=35.34s)]
*  And I think that one of the most important things to gain from that meeting is what an [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  historic time we're at right now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  The fact that Donald Trump was able to win with a mandate and the fact that the Republicans [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=44.9s)]
*  were able to take back the Senate and yes, a very slim majority in the House. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=48.86s)]
*  But this is a moment where we have to make sweeping changes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  We have to make a difference to the American people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=56.26s)]
*  And I think we're in a great position to do that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=58.78s)]
*  It reminds me of maybe our founding. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=61.22s)]
*  It's that important or even what Lincoln faced during the Civil War. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=63.46s)]
*  We have a president who is a rough-hewn entrepreneur matched with Mike Johnson, who is a constitutional [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=67.5s)]
*  scholar, both courageous, both understand the mission. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  And I think we're going to be carrying that out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=77.7s)]
*  And I think it's a really exciting time to see the two of them, which I think they're [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=79.14s)]
*  an interesting perfect match actually for right now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=82.82s)]
*  They're trying to balance, you know, what our founders looked at. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=85.94s)]
*  How do we preserve freedom but protect our security? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=88.94s)]
*  That's the border that's stopping the oppression from the over-bureaucratization, the deep [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=91.82s)]
*  state so-called, versus freedom, economic freedom, energy, releasing American energy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=97.9s)]
*  and allowing us to be the dominant player on the world stage, tax cuts, border. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=103.7s)]
*  All these things are going to come together to enhance what we call order of liberty and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=109.78s)]
*  what our founders envisioned. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  And I think we're right there at a moment to save America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's what President Trump and Mike Johnson and obviously Leader Thune in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=117.94s)]
*  the Senate, that was their message. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=121.86s)]
*  And of course, we got to hear from the great Stephen Miller about what was what his plans [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  are and his leadership as well. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  Truly, truly historic. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=129.7s)]
*  And you couldn't find two more divergent characters working together, which is a good thing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=131.14s)]
*  So the general idea, big picture idea is that we're looking at border tax cuts and perhaps [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=136.82s)]
*  death ceiling all in one package. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=142.46s)]
*  Is that kind of what y'all are going for? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=145.06s)]
*  And is that doable? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's what we're going to have to do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  And I think one of the things that Speaker Johnson emphasized is that we need to do this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=152.9s)]
*  in one large bill because we've got to get it done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=157.42s)]
*  We can't miss an opportunity. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=160.06s)]
*  We only get two shots at reconciliation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=161.7s)]
*  And that's that procedure in the Senate because we don't have a 60 vote margin. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=163.98s)]
*  So by doing that, we have certain limitations coming from the Senate parliamentarian, but [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  we've got to get these initiatives done. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=172.82s)]
*  We have a president who has promised the American people to do it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=175.04s)]
*  We've said to, I mean, Speaker Johnson said, keep your powder dry. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=178.61999999999998s)]
*  Let's make sure that we work with every single member, all of their needs and wants, what [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=182.22s)]
*  is in the best interest of the American people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=186.54s)]
*  And unity is going to be the order of the day. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=189.14s)]
*  We can't afford to lose one member. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=191.66s)]
*  I mean, basically one. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=194.1s)]
*  As we saw Friday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=195.1s)]
*  And we've got to make, we've got, yes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=196.1s)]
*  Well, that was, but this is what it's going to look like. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=197.9s)]
*  It's going to be very arduous. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=200.26s)]
*  But I think Speaker Johnson is the perfect person to do this, to work with Donald Trump, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=201.92s)]
*  who's very forceful. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=206.06s)]
*  But Speaker Johnson is persistent. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=207.06s)]
*  He's courageous. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=208.62s)]
*  He's also very patient and very willing to be sympathetic and listen to the needs of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=209.78s)]
*  our very diverse conference, which we have to get together. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=214.7s)]
*  This is historic. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=218.4s)]
*  We have to put this together. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=219.4s)]
*  We have to deliver for the American people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think we have a unique combination of true patriots that are going to do that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=223.3s)]
*  Well, it's going to be interesting to watch for sure. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman Tenney, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=231.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=234.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hxSEuXRXY&t=235.34s)]
