# American hostage, 5 others found murdered in Hamas tunnel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I)
*  All right, we begin the final hour of Fox and Friends with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=0.0s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Forces troops have located and recovered, sadly, the bodies of six hostages [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=5.0s)]
*  found in Gaza just days ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=10.32s)]
*  That does include American Hirsch Goldberg-Polen, according to an IDF spokesman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=12.86s)]
*  The hostages were found, quote, brutally murdered, possibly a day or two before IDF troops found [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=18.72s)]
*  them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=24.44s)]
*  Hamas abducted all six on October 7th, and their remains were found inside a tunnel in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=25.44s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=30.6s)]
*  Goldberg, Polen, and four others were kidnapped during the Nova Music Festival in October. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=31.6s)]
*  President Biden releasing a statement about Goldberg-Polen's death overnight, saying, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=37.6s)]
*  quote, I am devastated and outraged. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=41.84s)]
*  I have gotten to know his parents, John and Rachel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  They have been courageous, wise and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=47.44s)]
*  And it really is. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=55.24s)]
*  Really is. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=56.84s)]
*  It is, when I woke up this morning, I was reading about this story. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=57.84s)]
*  The most difficult thing to hear and to read is that they were alive until just a couple [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=63.2s)]
*  of days ago. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=67.04s)]
*  They were hostages. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=68.04s)]
*  They've endured hell in the hands of an evil terrorist organization, and then they were [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=69.04s)]
*  savagely executed, shot, presumably, as Israeli troops were getting closer. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=74.72s)]
*  We don't know if they were at the door or in the neighborhood or they were anticipating [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=80.56s)]
*  it, but clearly their Hamas captors thought they were better off dead if they were hoping [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=83.88s)]
*  to get away, and it underscores the savagery of Hamas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=90.56s)]
*  I guess there was a hostage not that long ago who was in a similar situation, and the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=94.4s)]
*  Hamas terrorist fled and left that person alive, and so there was hope that that might [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=100.56s)]
*  happen, but that is not what happened. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=107.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, back in March, Kamala Harris, who hasn't yet that we know of waited on this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=109.76s)]
*  latest execution of these hostages, did weigh in on what she thought about the Ra'afah [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=115.6s)]
*  offensive and saying it would be a mistake to do that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=122.36s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=128.04s)]
*  in Ra'afah would be a huge mistake. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=138.92s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=141.55999999999997s)]
*  I have studied the maps. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=142.55999999999997s)]
*  There's nowhere for those folks to go, and we're looking at about a million and a half [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  people in Ra'afah who are there because they were told to go there, most of them, and so [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  we've been very clear that it would be a mistake to move into Ra'afah with any type of military [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  operation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=160.64s)]
*  Actually, Kamala has weighed in, and here's what she had to say. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=161.64s)]
*  I think we're going to put that up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=166.6s)]
*  We may not have it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=168.92s)]
*  We'll have that in a moment. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=173.32s)]
*  She's weighed in, but she's been weighing in for a long time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=174.32s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  Here's the statement. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  I strongly condemn Hamas continued brutality and so must the entire world. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  As vice president, I have no higher priority than the safety of American citizens wherever [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  they are in the world. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  How much of that, number one, what's the substance there? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=189.88s)]
*  You really hang on that word about American citizens no matter where they are in the world. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=192.6s)]
*  Our administration has pressured Israel to give this fight up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=196.8s)]
*  What have we done to get our Americans home? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=202.44s)]
*  Maybe behind the scenes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=205.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=206.0s)]
*  I try to be optimistic, but it's hard to when you see an administration abandon our guys [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=207.0s)]
*  and gals in Afghanistan, and now it looks like they're just using this as an opportunity [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=210.84s)]
*  to score political points by telling Bibi he needs to get a ceasefire. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=215.84s)]
*  By the way, this administration has been working behind the scenes against Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  too. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  But after October 7th, they've tried to leverage that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  Gallant, the defense minister, there's a lot of reporting that the American administration [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=227.28s)]
*  is behind him and his efforts to take on Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=230.72s)]
*  They've been trying to tell Israel where they can and cannot raid. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=234.88s)]
*  I do like the example of imagine after 9-11 if some country was to tell us, well, you [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=238.44s)]
*  can't go to that town in Iraq or that town in Afghanistan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=242.72s)]
*  We'd say, go pound sand. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  We can go wherever we want for retribution for what happened to our people on 9-11. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  I think that's the same feeling a lot of Israelis have about this administration trying to tell [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=250.96s)]
*  them what targets they can hit. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=255.32s)]
*  Oh, you can go to Rafa, but you can't go over here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=256.76s)]
*  That's not how you defeat savage terrorists. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=259.24s)]
*  Well, actually, the execution of the war is under debate in Israel right now because many [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=261.2s)]
*  of the families of the hostages would like to see their loved ones being the priority [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=266.24s)]
*  and getting a ceasefire agreement versus trying to destroy Hamas before they're able to save [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=272.52s)]
*  their loved ones. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=280.16s)]
*  So I know we talked a little bit about Rafa because that's been in debate and I think [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=281.16s)]
*  it's helpful, Pete, if you could go and show us on the map what we're looking at. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  Rafa is a big sticking point. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=289.88s)]
*  It really is to the idea of any sort of a ceasefire with Hamas if that's truly what [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=291.36s)]
*  they want now that they're executing hostages. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  So you've got Israel here and Egypt. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=298.4s)]
*  This is the Sinai Peninsula. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=300.04s)]
*  We've got the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=301.44s)]
*  Initially, the attacks coming out of there on October 7th. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=303.2s)]
*  So Israel's been clearing for over 300 days portions of the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=305.92s)]
*  Rafa is the crossing into Egypt. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=310.12s)]
*  They've found a huge tunnel network there, over 500 tunnels, 50 of which, at a minimum, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=312.96s)]
*  lead between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=319.12s)]
*  That is the lifeline for Hamas. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  Weapons, people, you can even move—there's some reporting, potentially, that hostages [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=325.2s)]
*  could have moved back and forth. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's not even clear that all the hostages necessarily are in Gaza. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=331.46s)]
*  Right now, as of May, Israel controls Rafa, and they control a specific crossing point [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=335.48s)]
*  where most of that had happened. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  And Hamas, of course, is demanding that Israel shouldn't be able to be there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  So Hamas is saying, if we're going to get a ceasefire, Israel has to leave Rafa. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  And Benjamin Netanyahu is saying, well, why would we give up the one place where we can [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  control whether our enemy gets refit with more supplies? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=356.12s)]
*  And that's the sticking point right now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=360.44s)]
*  We talked about, though, really quick, Joey, that there's another place where we could [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=362.36s)]
*  exert pressure, and that is from Egypt, where we also, just like we give Israel a lot of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  money, and that's why we kind of also exert some control over how they operate, because [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=371.44s)]
*  this could lead—this is a tinderbox. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it could lead to a World War III situation, and of course, that would involve us. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=377.68s)]
*  But also we said— [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=383.16s)]
*  Egypt's been playing that shell game for a long time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=384.16s)]
*  We give a lot of money to Egypt. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  You talked about those tunnels. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=387.44s)]
*  Why aren't we telling Egypt to do something about those tunnels and holding our own foreign [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=388.72s)]
*  aid as a leverage there? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=393.56s)]
*  We should, and I don't know why we're not. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  Ultimately, this crossing point, Egypt doesn't want that problem coming onto their territory. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  You would see massive refugee camps in the Sinai Peninsula. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=403.04s)]
*  They talk a big game about wanting to help the Palestinian people in their plight, but [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  they don't want to let them into Egypt in another place out of this war zone. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=411.64000000000004s)]
*  You see, Hamas wants the people bottled up in Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=415.48s)]
*  If the people are bottled up in Gaza, it's more civilian shields and targets that they [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=418.34s)]
*  can use for their propaganda purposes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=422.02s)]
*  If Egypt allows them out, then ultimately, you've just got fighters in that area, and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=424.29999999999995s)]
*  it's a very different dynamic for Hamas. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=429.46s)]
*  With the map, I think it is important. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  Israel started the offensive in the north, and pushed south. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  So the idea that they would never go into Ra'afah makes no sense because the enemy [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=436.5s)]
*  went to Ra'afah. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  So did—and the argument Hamas and the UN and others are making is, well, as the enemy [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  went south, so did the civilian population, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=445.14s)]
*  And so it becomes a thicker and more difficult fight. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=447.62s)]
*  But no doubt, Ra'afah was an end state that Israel wanted to achieve. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=450.7s)]
*  They got there in May. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=453.9s)]
*  They've been holding it, preventing people from going back and forth, which puts a stranglehold [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=454.9s)]
*  on Hamas, making everything more desperate. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  Maybe that leads, guys, to a hostage negotiation eventually. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=461.26s)]
*  But Israel also assassinated Hamas's chief negotiator in Tehran, who's taking orders [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=465.02s)]
*  from Iran also. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=470.29999999999995s)]
*  So this is all super complicated. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=471.74s)]
*  Well, and in all these ceasefire agreements that have been put on the table, I remember [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=473.14s)]
*  one of them was Israel had kind of created a line across Gaza that they were securing, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=477.22s)]
*  and Hamas said, well, we'll do this deal if we control that line. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=481.22s)]
*  Well, Israel had to control that line in order to let civilians go back north so the invasion [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=485.42s)]
*  in Ra'afah wouldn't be as detrimental. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=489.86s)]
*  So all along the way, Hamas has undermined Israel's attempts to make a safer place for [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=492.1s)]
*  the civilians. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-ODACJ68I&t=496.66s)]
