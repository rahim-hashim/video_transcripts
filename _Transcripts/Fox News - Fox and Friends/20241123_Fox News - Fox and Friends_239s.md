# 'MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE': Daniel Penny trial sets a ‘bad precedent,’ ex-NYPD Lt says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw)
*  The defense rests in its case against Daniel Penny trial after New Testimony Friday revealed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=0.0s)]
*  that at the time of his death in the subway, Jordan Neely had an open warrant for his arrest. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=6.24s)]
*  This comes as career criminals continue to terrorize New York streets. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=12.76s)]
*  This week, an NYPD officer and bystander were shot, allegedly by a man with 17 priors. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=16.76s)]
*  And three others were killed in a stabbing spree after the alleged suspect was let out [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=24.36s)]
*  just weeks ago. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=29.12s)]
*  Our next guest calls the Penny Trial of Miscarriage of Justice. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=30.68s)]
*  Former NYPD Lieutenant and US Army veteran Dr. Darren Portier joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=33.96s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=39.52s)]
*  Great to have you, Charlie. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=40.52s)]
*  So just for viewers back home, step back and give a big picture. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=41.68s)]
*  Why is this trial, explain why this Daniel Penny trial is such a miscarriage of justice. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=47.8s)]
*  The reason why it's a miscarriage of justice is because crime is running rampant in the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=53.28s)]
*  city of New York. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=56.52s)]
*  The social contract is not being upheld. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=57.68s)]
*  The NYPD is at a deficit in connection with the personnel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  So they have yet to backfill the personnel to have on the street to protect us as common [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=64.28s)]
*  citizens. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=69.28s)]
*  So when we look at Daniel Penny's actions in protecting people that didn't have the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=70.28s)]
*  ability to protect themselves, it really sets a bad precedent for us as the common citizen [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=74.36s)]
*  to step in and help individuals that are in fear of a lunatic that's on a subway, such [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=79.68s)]
*  as this particular case. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=85.4s)]
*  The Manhattan DA is prosecuting a case that should not have come to fruition in a courtroom. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=86.84s)]
*  So you mean actually vilifying the police and cutting police services might possibly [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=92.56s)]
*  lead to more crime in the city? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  That's just absolutely shocking to think about. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  But the whole concept of a guy trying to, you know, we have a God given right to defend [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  ourselves and the idea that prosecutors would look at the situation and say, okay, this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=107.88s)]
*  guy was trying to defend himself and other people on the subway. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=112.72s)]
*  Let's prosecute him instead of these other crimes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=115.8s)]
*  It's kind of mind boggling, I think, for a lot of people who don't live in New York City. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=122.96s)]
*  You have to take into consideration the Manhattan DA is an elected official and he is catering [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=123.96s)]
*  towards the people that he believes will elect him for another term. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=129.48s)]
*  But this has become more of a travesty for us as common New Yorkers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=133.48s)]
*  And I just kind of want to go back to the backfill of the NYPD. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=137.4s)]
*  We have a city council and we have a mayor that's not pushing the appropriate agenda [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=140.56s)]
*  to put the appropriate number of officers on the street. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=144.64s)]
*  So as a result, we had an individual had a bench warm, an open bench warm that wasn't [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=147.76s)]
*  taken into custody prior. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=152.56s)]
*  Had he been taken into custody prior to we would have never had this incident. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  So it manifested to a place where epic proportions of crime have been plaguing the city of New [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=158.16s)]
*  York and we just don't have the personnel in the police department. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=163.32s)]
*  And this is what we're looking at as it relates to Mr. Penny protecting other citizens in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=166.54s)]
*  that subway car. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=170.84s)]
*  In your decades of experience in New York as an officer, have you ever seen have you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=171.92s)]
*  ever seen the situation quite as dire as it is in the city today? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=178.24s)]
*  Well, I was a cop back in the early 90s when the crack epidemic was was out of control, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=182.6s)]
*  but it's really getting worse. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=188.76s)]
*  And I blame our elected officials. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  I blame Mayor Adams. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=192.32s)]
*  And it started under de Blasio. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=193.8s)]
*  When we look at the Giuliani administration, we had tremendous revelations in the reduction [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=195.6s)]
*  of crime. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=200.4s)]
*  We had Bloomberg that came in. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=201.64s)]
*  He just merely rode or trace the pattern of what Giuliani put in place. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=202.96s)]
*  But when we see the catastrophic failures of the de Blasio administration has been carried [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=208.0s)]
*  over into Adams administration, that's when we see crime as plaguing our city and we as [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=212.4s)]
*  the common citizens are under siege. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, I sure hope that some people start listening to what you have to say because it's very [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  important. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Darren Porsche, thank you very much. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=226.48s)]
*  Thanks, Charlie. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=227.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=228.48s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=229.48s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=230.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62F9obj8BOw&t=231.48s)]
