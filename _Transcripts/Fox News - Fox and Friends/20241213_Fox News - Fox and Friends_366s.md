*  a half months after ICE released a hold against a suspect. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=57.68s)]
*  According to the authorities, the suspect once after the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=62.9s)]
*  accident jumped out of the car, took pictures of the crash and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=66.96s)]
*  then drove off instead of trying to help the victims. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=70.86s)]
*  Now, Ivory's family is demanding justice and Ivory's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=74.69999999999999s)]

*  Good morning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  I am so sorry. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=84.78s)]
*  You know, the month of this happened on December 1st, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=86.18s)]
*  Christmas month, and now your niece, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=89.04s)]
*  Christina, has lost her only child. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=91.68s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=96.36s)]
*  My niece has lost her only child. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=96.92s)]
*  Her dad has lost his only daughter. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  Our family has lost Ivory, which was loved throughout our [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=102.2s)]
*  family. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=106.94s)]
*  She was one of our youngest ones in the family. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=107.66s)]
*  And we're just seeking justice. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=110.9s)]
*  We're trying to get these laws changed because it's unfair. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  Like you guys say, it's 12 days before Christmas and we're [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=116.96s)]
*  planning a funeral instead of trying to celebrate Christmas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=119.92s)]
*  Sharonda, explain that thing that I just talked about in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=123.92s)]
*  this introduction, this migrant from Venezuela. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=128.36s)]
*  After he hit the other car, jumps out and rather than [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=133.08s)]
*  helps, he takes pictures and then gets in the car and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=137.44s)]
*  speeds away? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=140.74s)]
*  Yes, unfortunately. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=142.84s)]
*  He didn't care. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=145.54s)]
*  He didn't care that it was a mother and a daughter in that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  car scared that he had harmed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=151.2s)]
*  He didn't try to assist. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=155.2s)]
*  He didn't try to call for help. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  He got out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=158.62s)]
*  He took pictures and he tried to flee the scene. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=159.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=163.14s)]
*  Watch they lay lifeless. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=163.94s)]
*  And as we look at these images of this beautiful little girl, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=166.88s)]
*  she you know, her mother did everything right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=172.0s)]
*  She was in the seat. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  She was belted into the into the car seat. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=176.74s)]
*  She was just a few miles from home with her mom. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  And this happened. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=186.02s)]
*  You mentioned a moment ago that the laws have got to change. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people are not familiar with the DUI laws in Texas. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  What in particular is you are finding now is a gigantic [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=195.86s)]
*  problem for your family? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  The problem is we have to go and we have to fight along with [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  trying to bury these. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=208.28s)]
*  We have to go and fight the laws in court just to try to not have [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  them get released and get a bond and only to find out that no, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=215.28s)]
*  he had a bond for one hundred and fifty thousand. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=221.06s)]
*  It didn't matter what our justice was to fight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=223.96s)]
*  If ISIS had not put a hold on him, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=227.36s)]
*  he would have been released from jail right then when we went to court. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  So luckily he had an ice hole so he could stay in there and probably [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=235.48s)]
*  not be fleeing or do anything to harm another family. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  You want justice for ivory. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  What do you want to see done? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=248.76s)]
*  We want the laws in Texas to be stiffer. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=251.56s)]
*  When they when they make the decision to drinking dry, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=254.6s)]
*  they make a decision to possibly go to jail for a longer sentence [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=258.70000000000005s)]
*  because they don't give us those choices when we're riding on the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=265.36s)]
*  street just trying to get home from family house. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=269.3s)]
*  I should be able to ride. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=272.5s)]
*  People in Texas should be able to get in their car and get home safe [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  if we're doing everything correctly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  We shouldn't have to worry about someone drinking and driving on the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=280.54s)]
*  streets. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=283.98s)]
*  We know that a GoFundMe has been started. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=285.7s)]
*  Go just visit GoFundMe dot com to support ivory's family in their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=289.42s)]
*  time of loss. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=294.38s)]
*  But Sharonda if you would before you go, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=295.46s)]
*  can you tell us a little something about ivory? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=298.92s)]
*  That smile. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=304.56s)]
*  You all see it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=305.4s)]
*  We're going to miss it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=306.82s)]
*  We have so many memories of ivory. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=308.44s)]
*  She was such a bubbly star to us. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=311.96s)]
*  She loved the spotlight. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=315.84s)]

*  She was always that smile you see. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=326.18s)]
*  She was always smiling and we didn't protect her. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=328.52s)]
*  Texas laws didn't protect her. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=332.88s)]
*  She was just seven years old. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=337.7s)]
*  God rest her soul. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=339.12s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=340.3s)]
*  I know this is a tough interview to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  If people would like to help your family go to GoFundMe. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OfmrFZ0yn4&t=344.14000000000004s)]
