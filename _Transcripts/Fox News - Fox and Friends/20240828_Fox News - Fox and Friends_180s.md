# Peter Doocy: They just set expectations 'extremely high'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8)
*  All right, once President Biden wraps up his two-week vacation, he'll rally alongside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=0.0s)]
*  his vice president at a Labor Day event in Pittsburgh. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=5.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, today Harris and Walz are kicking off a two-day bus tour in Battleground, Georgia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=9.16s)]
*  Peter Ducey is live at the White House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=15.84s)]
*  Hey, Peter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=17.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=18.52s)]
*  The expectations for this Harris-Walz interview are extremely high because campaign officials [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=19.52s)]
*  didn't just have her get it over with. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=25.6s)]
*  They let pressure build and build and build for this one thing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=27.64s)]
*  And the booking process was apparently a two-way street. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=32.36s)]
*  Politico is reporting Harris campaign staff have been asking reporters who they think [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  she should talk to. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=39.74s)]
*  Behind the scenes, TV producers from big name anchors have been calling the campaign to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=40.74s)]
*  pitch their talent as the person she has to do it with. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=45.16s)]
*  They chose CNN. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=49.3s)]
*  It's been 38 days since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket and 20 days just to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=51.2s)]
*  get an interview scheduled. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=58.0s)]
*  There have been a lot of questions about when you're going to sit down for your first interview [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=60.2s)]
*  since being a nominee. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=66.48s)]
*  I talked to my team. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=67.48s)]
*  I want us to get an interview scheduled for the end of the month. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=68.48s)]
*  The Trump campaign is zeroing in on some traditional swing states the rest of the week. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=73.68s)]
*  And Trump will be in Michigan and Wisconsin tomorrow. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=78.64s)]
*  J.D. Vance in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=81.44s)]
*  The Harris campaign is taping that CNN interview and doing a rural bus tour in Georgia today [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=84.24s)]
*  and tomorrow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=90.8s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=91.8s)]
*  So, Peter, according to Politico, the team was reaching out and reporters and anchors [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=92.8s)]
*  were contacting the team. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=97.64s)]
*  Hey, we'd like to do the interview. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Did you reach out to the people behind you in that big white building and say, hey, I've [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=102.48s)]
*  got 50 questions for her? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=108.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=111.0s)]
*  I pitched myself in a text message to somebody in Wilmington that didn't get responded to. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=112.0s)]
*  We did see you in the hallway, though, at the Capitol. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=120.84s)]
*  I'll interview with you eventually? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=122.12s)]
*  It was just pleasantries there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=125.92s)]
*  But look, my pitch, I remember somebody getting elected president in the very recent past [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=127.64s)]
*  who used to mix it up with me on the campaign trail all the time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=133.36s)]
*  I think people like that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=136.04s)]
*  That is true. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=137.04s)]
*  That wasn't at the Capitol. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=138.88s)]
*  That was right after her speech. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=139.88s)]
*  So she was in a really good mood. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=141.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  And when she was running in 2019, I remember you were pretty much the only person she always [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  would talk to because everybody else was talking to people who were out in the lead. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=149.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=154.92s)]
*  And we're around. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=155.92s)]
*  I just looked at my September calendar. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=157.56s)]
*  We have time if the vice president wants to try to make something work with my schedule. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=159.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=163.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=164.6s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=165.6s)]
*  I want you to do it live. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=166.6s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=168.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=169.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=170.16s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iWhwwiZ_E8&t=171.16s)]
