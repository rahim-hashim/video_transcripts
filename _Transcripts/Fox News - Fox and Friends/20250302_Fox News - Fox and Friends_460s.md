# Democrats 'ramping up resistance' to Trump ahead of congressional address
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o)
*  President Trump will address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday as his second term [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=0.0s)]
*  gets off to a fast start. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=6.16s)]
*  And Democrats are already preparing their response with a plan to ramp up the resistance [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=8.44s)]
*  to Trump's agenda. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=12.56s)]
*  Madeleine Rivera joins us live from Washington. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=14.4s)]
*  Maddie, good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=17.92s)]
*  What does the resistance look like? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=19.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Democrats are divided over that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=21.32s)]
*  So President Trump is expected to highlight some of the work his administration has done [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=23.92s)]
*  and the rest of the work they want to do in his first address to Congress since retaking office. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=27.84s)]
*  He has moved with lightning speed, wielding his executive authority to address the border [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=32.8s)]
*  and reshape the federal government and his expansive use of that power has left Democrats [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=37.04s)]
*  wondering how to respond. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=41.8s)]
*  Axios reports House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=43.72s)]
*  do want members to attend the speech with a plus one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=48.16s)]
*  A congressional memo obtained by Axios asks House Democrats attending the joint address [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=51.68s)]
*  bring a guest who has been harmed by the Trump administration's early actions. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=56.48s)]
*  But other Democrats reportedly are weighing not attending. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=61.279999999999994s)]
*  Lawmakers who are supposedly leaning against or are undecided about going include Vermont [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=64.64s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Massachusetts Senator [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=70.0s)]
*  Ed Markey, among others. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=75.16s)]
*  Part of the Washington Post, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who notably tore apart [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=76.96s)]
*  the president's State of the Union address back in 2020, is now encouraging members to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  quote, let the president stew in his own juice. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=85.84s)]
*  Pelosi, who's still widely respected within the Democratic conference, reportedly wants [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Democrats to focus on the Republicans budget framework that GOP blueprint would enact. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  The president's agenda will also call for spending cuts, which Democrats argue would [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=99.56s)]
*  slash programs like Medicaid. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=104.2s)]
*  That in Pelosi's view would be a much more effective way for Democrats to respond rather [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=106.4s)]
*  than simply interrupting the president's speech. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=113.92s)]
*  Charlie Rachel and Peter. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=114.92s)]
*  Thank you, Maddie. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=116.16s)]
*  Thank you, Maddie. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=117.16s)]
*  Just can we keep Maddie up for one second? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=118.16s)]
*  I just wanted to double check the quote. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  You said that Nancy Pelosi wants Donald Trump to stew in his own juice. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=121.96s)]
*  That's according to the Washington Post. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a quote. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=127.28s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=128.88s)]
*  I saw I saw Charlie and then and Peter. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=129.96s)]
*  As soon as that you said that, Maddie, they went down to in juice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=133.32s)]
*  Colorful. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=139.8s)]
*  You definitely reported the juiciest part. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=140.4s)]
*  Yeah, you sure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=142.6s)]
*  We're grateful to you for that, Maddie. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=143.72s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=145.2s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=146.2s)]
*  Well, who can forget Nancy Pelosi ripping up the speech? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=147.2s)]
*  But you know what my favorite was? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=150.4s)]
*  Remember this clap? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=151.84s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=152.84s)]
*  So that person right here with the big ceremonial copy of the speech is the person who doesn't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=155.84s)]
*  want any of the Democrats to protest this time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=160.44s)]
*  It almost makes it feel like she, even though she's just a backbencher now, rank and file [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=165.88s)]
*  member, not the speaker, not leadership, it makes it feel like she has not blessed any [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  of the Democrats as the worthy successor to the Obama Biden Pelosi era. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  And I don't know who the next big demo is going to be, but she doesn't want she doesn't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  want the wrong one. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=187.44s)]
*  Here's what the Washington Post said about this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=188.44s)]
*  They said now a rank and file lawmaker, Pelosi retains a great degree of clout. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=190.0s)]
*  To your point, Pete, I mean, a Peter inside of the Democrat caucus, younger lawmakers [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=195.04s)]
*  continue to seek her counsel with recent discussions, including warnings to not turn on themselves, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=200.56s)]
*  turn themselves into part of the story during Tuesday's speech and urging them to narrow [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  their party's message in next year's midterm elections. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=211.2s)]
*  Any demonstration of disagreement, whether it's visual or whatever, just let him stew [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  in his own juice and don't be any grist for the mill to say this was inappropriate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  He said Thursday, so really rich coming from she who ripped up the speech and had the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=224.44s)]
*  funny clap. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=228.4s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=229.4s)]
*  Alligator clap. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=230.4s)]
*  The alligator clap was so good for I have to admit, like for about three weeks after that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=231.4s)]
*  That's all I did. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=236.88s)]
*  Every time Sean said anything, I'm like, this is great. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=237.88s)]
*  I did the clap. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=240.72s)]
*  Here's why I think some of them are not going to go. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=242.4s)]
*  Usually a State of the Union address this early in is just like, I'm going to do this [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=245.44s)]
*  and I'm going to do that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=250.24s)]
*  And it's a lot of fantasy talk about all the things they think they're going to do, hope [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=251.28s)]
*  they're going to do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=255.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to show up there on Tuesday and he's going to have solid accomplishments [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=257.12s)]
*  that have been done in just one month, more than what many presidents get done in even [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=263.28s)]
*  three years. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=270.08s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=271.64s)]
*  We talked earlier about the border, Charlie. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=272.64s)]
*  I mean, it's gone down like 90 some percent in terms of illegal crossings. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=274.84s)]
*  Huge accomplishments and then all the money saved on top of that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=280.56s)]
*  Such a great point. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=284.16s)]
*  And the idea of him stewing in his juices, the juices of success, the juices of winning. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=285.32s)]
*  He's just good. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=291.8s)]
*  You get him a hot tub of his juices of winning and success and he can just sit up in there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=292.8s)]
*  And like you say, and it's such a great point. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=298.32s)]
*  It'll be the first time ever that you have somebody in that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=300.96s)]
*  Of course, this is not a State of the Union address. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=304.04s)]
*  This is a joint address to Congress. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a slightly different title because it's because he's not been there for more than, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=309.56s)]
*  as you say, two months, matter of weeks. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=314.84s)]
*  But he's going to actually be talking about successes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=318.36s)]
*  Yeah, he said he said we would get tired of winning. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=321.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=324.36s)]
*  Remember my my fancy Pelosi. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=325.36s)]
*  Fun fact. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=329.0s)]
*  You know that she what she has for lunch every day. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=330.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=331.92s)]

*  I'm telling you, it is not free. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=369.2s)]
*  You have to pay for your own hot dog. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=371.8s)]
*  But that is what they serve. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=373.92s)]
*  So I'm imagining that's where she's getting the hot dog. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=375.08s)]
*  She's been there a long time. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=377.28s)]
*  So don't miss. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=378.28s)]
*  I'm going to tell you this, too. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=379.28s)]
*  She's eating hot dogs for lunch. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=381.6s)]
*  That woman say what you will about her. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=383.56s)]
*  She's very trim. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=386.08s)]
*  She still has, you know, you know, sharp mind in her step. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=387.64s)]
*  She's very sharp minded. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=392.2s)]
*  I mean, she's very impressive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=393.52s)]
*  You can see a lot of things. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=395.92s)]
*  You know how much older she's older than Joe Biden. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=396.92s)]
*  I know it's so amazing that always amaze me. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=399.16s)]
*  The other one that is is aging backwards is Maxine Waters. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=402.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=406.36s)]
*  Again, another person. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=407.36s)]
*  Well, if you're starting out at zero, it's really not that hard. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=408.36s)]
*  It's less hard. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=411.68s)]
*  Can we can somebody tell us how old Maxine Waters is? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=412.68s)]
*  I'll probably look at that really quick. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Maxine Waters face ID. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  But the great thing is all their bank accounts are going in the right direction. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  She's 86. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  She looks amazing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  You're right. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=425.56s)]
*  All of Nancy Pelosi's Nancy Pelosi's aging backwards. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=426.56s)]
*  Her bank account is going the other way. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=429.96s)]
*  Am I the only one getting yelled at right now? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=431.68s)]
*  I think I'm the only one getting it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=433.44s)]
*  They want us to promote the presidential joint address to Congress. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=434.44s)]
*  I will be up late for this at the White House. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=438.28s)]
*  It airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. on the Fox News Channel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=440.2s)]
*  And I will be there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  And sorry, I derailed this entire segment. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=443.84s)]
*  No, I shouldn't have mentioned the hot dog. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't know how I did that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnAwVUC3f_o&t=447.52s)]
