# Expert breaks down threat assessment amid suspected CEO killer manhunt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io)
*  Fox News alert the FBI stepping in to help with a nationwide manhunt for the suspected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=0.0s)]
*  killer who gunned down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=6.0s)]
*  And now other companies are looking to step up protection for their leaders. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=10.0s)]
*  But our next guest warns effective security goes beyond bodyguards. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=14.16s)]
*  Former leader of threat management team at UnitedHealth Group, Jameson Ritter joins us [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=18.2s)]
*  now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=23.92s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=24.92s)]
*  Let's start with this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  A threat management team at a place like UnitedHealth, which we just saw this being the target, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  what would you do? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=32.88s)]
*  Like how would you assess these types of threats and what are your warnings here for other [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=33.88s)]
*  companies? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=37.84s)]
*  Well, you know, at the end of the day, a threat management team is truly multidisciplinary. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=38.84s)]
*  What we try to do is take all information regarding threats to employees, the staff, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=45.52s)]
*  to others, assess those for escalation to violence, and then ultimately try to intervene [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=51.16s)]
*  in some way that prevents somebody from escalating to violence. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=56.76s)]
*  So at the end of the day, it's a lot of prevention, a lot of hard work and a lot of collaboration [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=61.0s)]
*  with other elements within and outside the company. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=67.19999999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you about one of the specific things that you have told us about myths or [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=69.4s)]
*  mistakes made when you're talking about protecting CEOs. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=74.72s)]
*  The myth that employees snap. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=78.36s)]
*  That is something that we all have come to believe, I think, anecdotally, that all of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=80.96s)]
*  a sudden employee loses it and boom, but instead it's, as you describe it, more like a cat [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=86.0s)]
*  and mouse game. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=91.6s)]
*  Would you explain that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=92.6s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=93.6s)]
*  So targeted violence, things like terrorism, active shooters, school shooters, workplace [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=95.34s)]
*  violence, all those things. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=104.24s)]
*  It really is about a understandable escalation, a pathway to violence. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=105.6s)]
*  What we're looking at here is predatory violence or targeted violence, which is a deliberate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=112.14s)]
*  decision to go from grievance to action through several understandable stages. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  Our job as security professionals is to try to move that timeline further and further [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=122.36s)]
*  away from an action of violence. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=126.96s)]
*  So we can observe things like planning, surveillance, communications, what we might call leakage, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=129.56s)]
*  where people are on social media talking to friends and family about their intent or their [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=136.72s)]
*  grievance. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=141.12s)]
*  So we're really trying to pick a needle out of a haystack in a lot of ways and identify [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=142.12s)]
*  the one of potentially hundreds or thousands of people that might have the ability to go [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=146.0s)]
*  from having a very strong grievance to willing and able to act in violence. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=152.16s)]
*  So Jameson, I know that you may be somewhat read into this investigation, but I don't [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  want to presume you know specifically about this instance just yet. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=161.6s)]
*  I mean, you did work with United Health Group. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=164.88s)]
*  But we're having a conversation, you and I, just now, in how you assess threats that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=168.32s)]
*  come from internally, I think. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=173.2s)]
*  I believe that's the presumption underlying whether or not someone snaps or stalks you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=175.72s)]
*  But is there anything in this particular case right now that leads you down the path of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=181.06s)]
*  we're having the right conversation that this is about some threat that emerged internally? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=185.3s)]
*  Or could it still be an external threat here that is this case when it comes to United Health? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=189.98s)]
*  You know, it's hard to say at this early stage, but what I'd be willing to say is the threat [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=197.3s)]
*  management process assessing these types of threats really can come from any direction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=202.1s)]
*  It can be external, can be internal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=207.42s)]
*  It can come from all sources. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=210.66s)]
*  In a case like this, it's possible that this person may have communicated with others outside [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=212.38s)]
*  the company, within the company, through other methods. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=221.06s)]
*  It's clear, at least from my perspective, that in many ways, this is a very, very strong [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=224.9s)]
*  case of a grievance move to action. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=231.36s)]
*  So the things like what we've been hearing about the items written on the ammunition, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=234.1s)]
*  the ability to do surveillance, to be there early. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  All of these things are very deliberate target predatory violence, predatory acts leading [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  up to violence. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  Even I would suggest, I would presume identifying Mr. Thompson suggests there is some familiarity [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=252.7s)]
*  and perhaps even a grievance here as the motivation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=259.34s)]
*  But we'll see, you have to see those plays out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=262.14s)]
*  Jameson Ritter, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=263.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=265.42s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnIF8531Io&t=266.42s)]
