# Trump roasts Harris, Dems with Schumer next to him: 'He likes me'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE)
*  Catholic Church, you're helping the poor, educating children and supporting the vulnerable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=0.0s)]
*  But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=7.44s)]
*  have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  and she would have been here guaranteed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  She would have been here guaranteed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=20.64s)]
*  It's a true pleasure to be with you this evening. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=27.56s)]
*  Amazing pleasure. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  And these days it's really a pleasure anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Anytime I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=42.64s)]
*  But unfortunately, Governor Walz isn't here himself, but don't worry, he'll say that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=47.4s)]
*  he was. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=52.36s)]
*  But I have to be careful, however, to understand that this will be the first time in the history [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=53.36s)]
*  of this event where jokes will be fact-checked, and they will be. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=63.28s)]
*  All polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote, as I should be, as I should [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=69.16s)]
*  be. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=75.56s)]
*  But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=77.44s)]
*  She hasn't. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=79.68s)]
*  I have a friend of mine who's attending tonight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=80.68s)]
*  She's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=82.44000000000001s)]
*  That's the president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=86.48s)]
*  You had a balance because you got to tell these jokes, but you're sitting next to people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=90.28s)]
*  that don't like you at all. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=97.84s)]
*  Chuck Schumers right there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  So how was that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, I know him very well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  I guess he doesn't like, but he likes me enough. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit, it's hard to explain. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  When I gave him his first check, when he was young, I was young, it was his first check. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=108.76s)]
*  I don't know if that's good or bad, but it was the first check that he ever got. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  He was running for, I think, assembly up in New York, and he got it from me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=116.64s)]
*  So we should blame you for the rise of structure. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  It's all on you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=125.4s)]
*  It was New York. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=126.4s)]
*  What did Mayor Adams say to you? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  Because you were, I mean, he's a Democrat, you're a Republican, but you can relate because [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=130.0s)]
*  of these subpoenas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=134.68s)]
*  Letitia James, she was in the back row. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=135.68s)]
*  The weaponization. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=137.64s)]
*  Now, look, I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone, I say it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=138.64s)]
*  But Adams, he came out against the immigrants, you know, against the destruction of New York, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  frankly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  He did the right thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  I said, he will be indicted within six months. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  And he was. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=153.72s)]
*  They indicted him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  Now, I don't know if it's legit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  I haven't looked at it, but it seems very suspicious when he comes out against something [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  They're destroying the country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  They are destroying our country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  He was right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=165.64s)]
*  I go down the streets of New York. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=166.64s)]
*  I went down the streets of New York two days ago and I'm looking at migrants all over Madison [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=169.44s)]
*  Avenue, all over Fifth Avenue. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=174.04s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=176.0s)]
*  I'll tell you, I've never seen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  This is New York. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  You see empty stores. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  You never see empty stores on Madison Avenue. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  You never see them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=183.56s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=185.48s)]
*  He did the right thing, but he got indicted. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=186.48s)]
*  And they play weaponization. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  These are an evil group of people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  These are really a bad group of people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=192.2s)]
*  I'm doing well with myself. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=194.2s)]
*  I won in Florida. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=195.32s)]
*  I'm winning all over the place. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=196.56s)]
*  But you know what they want to do is keep them busy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=197.92s)]
*  Let me spend plenty of money fighting it and let them maybe. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=200.92s)]
*  But I think so far it's backfired because the public understands the win in Florida. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=204.32s)]
*  That was the big case. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  That was the case. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're going to lose. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  Now he actually lost because he had documents, but he didn't have the presidential. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  You're talking about the documents case in Florida. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  It was the documents case. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=215.72s)]
*  That was like they say the big one. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=216.88s)]
*  I don't know what's the big one, but the big one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=218.4s)]
*  And we had a very brilliant judge, a very fair judge. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=220.64s)]
*  And I won the case. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=223.84s)]
*  I won the whole thing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=225.0s)]
*  He didn't win. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=226.56s)]
*  They said he was grossly incompetent. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=227.72s)]
*  And based on that, they're not going to charge him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=229.64s)]
*  But the funny is he can be president, but he can't go to court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=232.72s)]
*  They say he can't go to court because he's incompetent. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=236.88s)]
*  So he can't go to court. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=239.64s)]
*  So that's OK. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=240.64s)]
*  But he's allowed to be president. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=241.64s)]
*  So there's something wrong with our country when that happens. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=243.18s)]
*  But I thought last night, Steve, I thought last night, I think it was terrible that you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=246.76s)]
*  missed it because it's only been one person missed it in many years. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=252.32s)]
*  And that's Walter Mondale. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=256.8s)]
*  He lost 49 to one. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=257.8s)]
*  But let me ask you, why do you think she missed it? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=259.36s)]
*  God was not with her. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=261.2s)]
*  Mr. President, why do you think she missed it? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=262.2s)]
*  There's a lot of theories. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=263.92s)]
*  OK, I think that she's not competent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=264.92s)]
*  I don't want to say this kind of stuff, but we can't live with this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=266.8s)]
*  We're not going to be able to live with this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=269.68s)]
*  So you don't think she's funny? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=270.68s)]
*  I don't think she's funny. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=273.2s)]
*  Look, her staff, she's got 5% of her staff stayed with her, 95% quit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=274.2s)]
*  If that happened to me, I'd be front page of every, nobody likes her, nobody wants to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=279.84s)]
*  be with her. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  And I only say this, I don't like even saying it, but we can't have her as a president. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  She's a Marxist. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=288.76s)]
*  We're not ready for a Marxist. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=289.76s)]
*  Do you agree with that, Angela? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  I do agree with you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  Angela is a Marxist? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, let me ask you this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  And she's not very good, let's just face it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  Closing argument time because we're only two and a half weeks until the election. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  So this is the final, this is it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  So she realized, joy, joy, joy, that's not working for them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  Not working too well. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=308.64s)]
*  They've changed it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=309.76s)]
*  They now they're ramping up their rhetoric. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=310.76s)]
*  And when she sat down with Bret Baer, she said, talking about you, he's unstable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=312.76s)]
*  When she was speaking at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, she called you unstable and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=317.88s)]
*  unhinged. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=322.4s)]

*  law to put anyone that doesn't look white in camps. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=338.56s)]
*  And I'm scared. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=342.44s)]
*  And she says, yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=343.44s)]
*  So you've hit on a really important point. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=344.64s)]
*  What is your response and what is your closing argument? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=347.4s)]

*  She's not smart. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=360.68s)]
*  Everyone knows that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=361.56s)]
*  Didn't even pass her law exam. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=363.24s)]
*  It was a big thing. She never thought she was going to be able to pass it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=364.76s)]
*  You know, you tell me this stuff, I'll say it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=368.23999999999995s)]

*  So far, it hasn't worked. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=386.64s)]
*  I guess that's the attack they have for this week. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=387.76s)]
*  It doesn't seem to be working. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=390.47999999999996s)]

*  I am the most stable human being. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=396.76s)]
*  I've been doing this for a long time. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=399.04s)]
*  We had four years of greatness. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=401.0s)]
*  We had the greatest economy in history. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=402.88s)]
*  We had the greatest border. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=404.8s)]
*  Brian, you were down there. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=406.16s)]
*  Absolutely. We had a border that was the best we've ever had in the history of our country. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=407.0s)]
*  There's never been anything like it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=411.04s)]
*  I built five hundred and fifty one miles of wall, which is far more than I said I was going to build when I campaigned. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=413.12s)]
*  I had a border where the drugs were at the lowest level, the human traffickers in women, they traffic in women. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  Everything was at the lowest level. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=424.52s)]
*  I got kudos from the border patrol, gave me with thousands of people, unanimous, every single one. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=426.12s)]
*  They endorsed you, Mr. President. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=433.52s)]
*  They endorsed me. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=434.6s)]
*  And what can you do better than that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZMX57ec1EE&t=435.32s)]
