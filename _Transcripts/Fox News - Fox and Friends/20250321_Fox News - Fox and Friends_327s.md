# Congress tees up first hearing on JFK assassination in decades
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg)
*  Chad program was outside the capital asking people what they feel like that they have a right to know watch this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm excited to see I believe it's information that could help shape a lot of opinions [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=8.24s)]
*  There's a lot of truth that's being hidden. We we need to know I do think some of that information should be released [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=13.68s)]
*  But I also think again the general public with too much information that especially when they're not educated enough on the information is probably [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=19.0s)]
*  Not the best idea if they are gonna release everything they should release everything from A to Z [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  That we you have the full perspective of what really happened. Once again, there's things that I really don't want to know [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=32.6s)]
*  Alright [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=40.08s)]
*  Chad welcome back here here to discuss something what you found out there in the public forum [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  So as we let go of 80,000 was it 60 or 80,000 worth of JFK pages? Do you feel like this is a good step? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=46.16s)]
*  Do you get the sense from the people of the transparency they want from the government? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  Well, just the fact that they're looking at this right now [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=56.8s)]
*  You know, this will be the first congressional hearing on the JFK assassination since the mid [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=59.14s)]
*  1990s and at that hearing you had the former CIA director Bob Gates at the time [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  He said the only thing more horrifying than the assassination itself was what he termed a perverse notion that the government [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=68.2s)]
*  Took part in killing John F [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=75.92s)]
*  Kennedy now as you saw when I talked to people at the Capitol you kind of had a division there [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=77.84s)]
*  You had one group of people who said release everything we have a right to know [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=82.08s)]
*  You had another group of people who said there are things that we don't need to know and don't want to know and when I was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=85.84s)]
*  Outside yesterday. I talked to Glenn Ivey the Democratic representative from Maryland [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=92.12s)]
*  He just happened to be there and he said this is very representative of where we are as a country [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=96.36s)]
*  We're skeptical of government people believe there's a tendency for government to cover up kind of CYA [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=101.24s)]
*  So this hearing is going to be next Wednesday and there's also skepticism about the Epstein files [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=106.84s)]
*  Some people think that the release was botched and also there's going to be files coming out about Martin Luther King jr [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  And also this is the big one UFOs guys you have right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  So I understand there was a bit of a mistake though with JFK files [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=122.36s)]
*  They let go of some people's social security numbers and personal addresses and information [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=125.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's something [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=129.52s)]
*  I mean [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=130.72s)]
*  I was told a couple of days before that they were going to go through and redact a lot of things even though [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=131.0s)]
*  President Trump said that there would be no redactions, but yeah [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=135.32s)]
*  There were things like that that did come out and so that's something anytime you're declassifying this information [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=138.12s)]
*  Even though some of it goes back decades some of that information is probably going to be in that paperwork [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=143.64s)]
*  Hey, what are you hearing like for MLK? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  People would like to know more about his life, but I understand some people don't want to know everything [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=150.76s)]
*  What are they what are they worried about and when it comes to JFK jr? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=154.72s)]
*  Why wouldn't the government want that released if the government did something wrong as many people have predicted? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=160.0s)]
*  Then that was a long time ago. It's a different government now. Why not just have the transparency? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's what I was so struck by about the gentleman from Tyler, Texas there [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=170.08s)]
*  He said you know if something bad is going to happen or maybe if they had done something bad [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  He said I'm not sure that I really want to know he said I kind of want to you know be aboveboard there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=178.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm I'm of the mind that I want to know maybe that's because I'm a journalist [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=182.56s)]
*  I would rather have more information and that was something that you know Glenn Ivey said he said you know more transparency [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=186.24s)]
*  The more information that's out there people can make their own judgments [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=191.6s)]
*  So Chad tell us about the mood on Capitol Hill when it comes to impeaching these federal judges. I know it's a high burden [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=194.8s)]
*  But a lot of people me included feel like that these judges are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=201.76s)]
*  Overstepping their boundaries and their roles getting ahead of their skis is there support on Capitol Hill for impeachment though [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=205.72s)]
*  We will know more about that when the house comes back next week. The process is the same with presidents [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=212.68s)]
*  You know, they impeached the former Homeland Security Secretary [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=218.04s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas last year. They've only impeached four federal judges in the past 36 years [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=221.36s)]
*  There were two impeached in 2009 Thomas Porteous was impeached and convicted removed from the bench [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=227.12s)]
*  You had Samuel Kent who was impeached but resigned before a trial. So Brandon Gill who is a freshman Republican from Texas [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=233.64s)]
*  He has drawn up these articles of impeachment for James Boasberg [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=240.76s)]
*  Accused him of abuse of power and again, this is going to be hard to do why because it's about the math [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=244.44s)]
*  There's a narrow majority in the house and we have to see [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  Just how hard President Trump or Elon Musk might, you know push the house speaker Mike Johnson [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=253.44s)]
*  you know there was an effort to kind of do a snap impeachment in 2023 with President Biden by Lauren Boebert and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=259.36s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy the speaker of the house at the time said no, you know, he said this is too serious [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=266.12s)]
*  We're not gonna just do this on the fly. We're gonna go through committee [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=269.92s)]
*  We're gonna have investigations [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=272.7s)]
*  But if you put something on the floor right away and the votes are there then that person is impeached as I say [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  It's about the math [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=280.1s)]
*  But if they were to get this through the House of Representatives [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=280.86s)]
*  Then there would also be on a lot of pressure on John Thune [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=284.38s)]
*  The majority leader in the Senate to take it up [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=288.06s)]
*  But one thing I have to tell you might be able to impeach somebody in the house [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=290.38s)]
*  But removing them from the federal bench in these circumstances, that's never going to happen [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=293.98s)]
*  You need 67 votes to convict in the Senate right and and John Roberts says I really don't want to go there [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=298.86s)]
*  I don't even think he should be bringing it up. I think that the oversight chair Jim Jordan's indicated [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  He's gonna entertain it. So we'll see what he actually decides to do. Thanks Chad. Thank you Chad. Thank you [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-6suWXzMsg&t=311.09999999999997s)]
