# There are so many ‘ripple effects’ from these policy failures: Wisconsin senate candidate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw)
*  Today Donald Trump heads to Wisconsin, his fourth rally this year in that critical battleground [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=0.0s)]
*  state in a bid to win over any potential undecided voters with less than 60 days till the election. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=9.6s)]
*  But it could be an uphill climb for the former president. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=17.16s)]
*  One poll showing Kamala Harris with a six point lead in the Badger state. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=20.04s)]
*  Our next guest is set to speak at Trump's rally in Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Havdie [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=23.7s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=29.419999999999998s)]
*  Eric, your race is fascinating and important nationally because whatever happens in Wisconsin [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=30.38s)]
*  is really going to determine the White House. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=36.7s)]
*  So if you do well, Trump does well. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=39.18s)]
*  If Trump does well, you do well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=40.66s)]
*  And you're both kind of running against candidates that hide from the press, fly under the radar [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=43.34s)]
*  and people don't know a lot about them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  Talk to us about all this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=52.78s)]
*  Look, they're the same thing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=54.22s)]
*  They are both extraordinarily liberal. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=57.3s)]
*  They're trying to change their positions of what they've stood for. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=60.66s)]
*  You know, they support boys playing in girls sports, men going to women's bathrooms, transgender [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=64.38s)]
*  enough our kids, the Green New Deal, which would devastate farmers and, you know, just [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=70.9s)]
*  propel inflation, opening our southern border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=76.9s)]
*  They've done nothing about the fentanyl crisis. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=80.46s)]
*  All these things, you know, they're just so far out there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=83.1s)]
*  And both of them run from the press. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=87.0s)]
*  They don't debate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=89.2s)]
*  Look, they're so out of line with Wisconsin. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=90.72s)]
*  We're a center right state. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=94.72s)]
*  We're a true purple state, but we're center right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=96.56s)]
*  And you know, we have family values in this state. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=99.12s)]
*  I always think it's interesting whenever we start talking about these undecided voters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=101.72s)]
*  because it seems like you never do find any actual undecided voters. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=105.08s)]
*  But what do you find is the most effective message to those undecided voters? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=108.72s)]
*  Look, the biggest issue by far is the economy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=114.48s)]
*  I mean, people have been crushed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=117.52s)]
*  The price of groceries, gasoline, energy, you know, housing costs. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=119.72s)]
*  And by the way, has everybody looked at their auto insurance bill the last few months? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=128.88s)]
*  So these are the issues that matter the most to people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  And then you have markets like Milwaukee, where crime has become a major problem. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=136.88s)]
*  People are concerned about health care costs and access to care. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=142.22s)]
*  Up in the Northwoods, where Rachel used to live, getting access to health care has become [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=146.3s)]
*  a real acute problem. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=152.02s)]
*  So you know, these are the issues. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=154.22s)]
*  It's the pocketbook issues, the things that affect people's lives every day that really [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=156.12s)]
*  are the things that matter most. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=160.42s)]
*  One of the things we know that impacts people's lives, Eric, is illegal immigration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=162.7s)]
*  It impacts people's lives in many different ways. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=166.7s)]
*  And one of the things that's being highlighted recently is what we saw in Colorado with [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=169.22s)]
*  a Venezuelan gang taking over apartment blocks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=174.3s)]
*  But now we know as well it's happening in Wisconsin, the same very same Venezuelan gang. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=176.46s)]
*  Bill Mollusian tweeted out or posted on X, police in Prairie Duchenne, a small city in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=181.82s)]
*  rural Wisconsin with a population of just 5,400 announced the arrest of a suspected [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=189.7s)]
*  Venezuelan trend, the Aragua gang member who allegedly violently and sexually attacked [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=194.96s)]
*  a woman and injured a juvenile in the process. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  ICE now involved. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=202.68s)]
*  Your reaction to what's happening in Wisconsin, Eric? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=204.96s)]
*  Look every state's a border state now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  We've had multiple incidences with illegal immigrants. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=211.68s)]
*  We had one that killed his own two children about a month ago in our state. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=215.56s)]
*  We had a father of several young children who was killed in a drunk driving accident [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=220.48s)]
*  by a legal immigrant. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=225.92s)]
*  We had a 12 year old girl that was kidnapped. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=228.14s)]
*  Fortunately, she got away and was able to break out of the car and run to a house. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=231.16s)]
*  So we've had these issues. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=238.04s)]
*  Every state's a border state. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  And you know, the fentanyl, we lost 108,000 Americans last year, but in Wisconsin, it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=241.44s)]
*  touched Wisconsin in a very profound way. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=246.92s)]
*  I mean, this fentanyl crisis is killing young Americans. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  It's the number one killer of Americans from 18 to 45. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=253.0s)]
*  So the crime issues, the fentanyl issues, the, you know, compounding the problems of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=256.68s)]
*  access to housing and health care are, you know, are all being rippled effects on our [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  state because of this illegal immigration. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=268.84s)]
*  Well, Eric, a lot of people saying that Kamala Harris learned how to hide in this election [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=271.08s)]
*  from her boss, Joe Biden. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=276.44s)]
*  I think it's from Tammy Baldwin. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=279.8s)]
*  She's been doing this for a long time. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=281.04s)]
*  We're hoping you can smoke her out and we can get to know what she really believes and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=282.88s)]
*  really face the voters because she's done this for a decade or more. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=287.72s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=291.68s)]
*  She's only given me one debate, usually get three to four. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=293.48s)]
*  She doesn't answer questions by the press. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=297.2s)]
*  She runs back in our state as a moderate and she's voted typically one of the two or three [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=299.32s)]
*  most liberal senators. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=303.92s)]
*  That's not democracy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  That's not democracy. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  So if people want to help out, if I win this race, we take control of the Senate. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=309.04s)]
*  I think President Trump is going to win it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=313.88s)]
*  Don't pay attention to polls. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=316.44s)]
*  They had him under polling in 16 and 20 losing by a lot. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=318.04s)]
*  We need to win this state, me and President Trump. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=322.72s)]
*  So if you want, send some money to erichuffty.com and help us out. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=325.24s)]
*  But we plan to win this thing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=331.92s)]

*  You got it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2e7M0dpkLw&t=336.40000000000003s)]
