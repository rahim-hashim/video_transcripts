# Official warns of 'really disturbing' trend at border
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI)
*  Joining us now from my home state of Texas DPS lieutenant Christopher Oliver is who released these videos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's gonna join us right now. He's gonna meet later on with Holman and Abbot as well LT [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=5.28s)]
*  Thanks so much for getting up this morning [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=10.86s)]
*  Hey, good morning. Orange great to be with you. So LT. I want to play this video that you captured yet again for audience [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=13.16s)]
*  Let's watch it [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=18.82s)]
*  Venezuela mama Venezuela [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=20.86s)]
*  See get up to the tennis [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=25.779999999999998s)]
*  So, you know LT Steve asked a great question [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  He goes who's changing a diaper of this child who who lets your child go through the jungle like this alone [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=45.14s)]
*  And I guess the question how common is this L2? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=53.22s)]
*  You know Lawrence, you know just that video alone is very powerful very heartbreaking to see that two-year-old, you know child [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=57.9s)]
*  And just really puts it in perspective know the precarious journey these children make you know from their home countries to the United States [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=63.78s)]
*  and the fact that these current policies over the last four years and continue to place these children [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=69.58s)]
*  exposed to criminal networks and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=77.18s)]
*  Places their lives in danger when they come across that border, you know to come across the border with a piece of paper [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=79.18s)]
*  With a phone number and a first name [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=83.62s)]
*  That's all the information they have not knowing where this child is gonna end up once their process by US Border Patrol [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  It's really disturbing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  That's why there's three over three hundred thousand children that are unaccounted for and probably more that we don't know about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=92.98s)]
*  And the fact is that Border Patrol now they have to process these children and they have to deal with these children before they're turned [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  Over to Health and Human Services and then from there again, you know [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=103.22s)]
*  We don't know what sponsors they end up with what guardian they end up with and that's why you know [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=106.14s)]
*  I'm really you know truly honored that you're you know sharing this story because I think for the most part [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=110.44s)]
*  You know [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  We don't talk too much about the children that are coming across that border by themselves and it continues to happen every single day [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=115.86s)]
*  Just before I came on the show this morning [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=121.36s)]
*  We just had a group of over 200 that came across an eagle past, Texas and in that group were 50 plus unaccompanied children [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=123.41999999999999s)]
*  So again, this this becomes this continues to be become a problem [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=130.18s)]
*  We start seeing more of these unaccompanied children coming across this border. Yeah, you know everybody's talking about Trump separating families [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=133.94000000000003s)]
*  They're coming across the border separated [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=140.26000000000002s)]
*  You got 50 children just today with some breaking news that came across the border that don't have their parents [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=141.86s)]
*  So I guess the big question is LT you got the Trump administration that are gonna be there in less than 50 days [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  I think what's gonna change? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  You know one thing I do want to add just what you mentioned there right now, you know over the years [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, we have faced so much criticism governor Abbott has faced so much criticism by you know placing buoys in the river placing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=161.5s)]
*  razor wire along the river [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  but yet none of these activists or the civil rights groups have been to the border have not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=169.62s)]
*  Actually encountered these unaccompanied children have not even pulled out a dead body a child from the river that had drowned because they cross a dangerous [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  River, but yet we put all these we put all these structures in place to help save lives and also to prevent illegal border [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  Crosses but yet not one of them has done anything to put any type of strategy in place to prevent children from crossing a dangerous border [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=189.18s)]
*  Now what we can look forward to now, you know in the future now that you know [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=196.5s)]
*  The governor Abbott and Tom Homan are already working on, you know something to get the border secured, you know [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=199.66s)]
*  They're not waiting till January 20th. I think it really shows that we have a great partnership now with the federal government [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  We have an ally as opposed to having an adversary. So that's great for Texas [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=209.5s)]
*  That's great for the entire country and you know [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  We'll support whatever we can do in Texas to help this administration get their policies [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=215.18s)]
*  Push forward and also to help secure the border even more, you know [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=219.62s)]
*  I've been saying Texas is the last line of defense for the country because [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=222.66s)]
*  Border Patrol has hasn't been able to help you guys because they've been doing processing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=226.86s)]
*  So finally the Calvary is coming for our home state of Texas LT. Thanks so much for joining us this morning [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGbGV3hqKpI&t=230.58s)]
