# Justice Roberts urged to 'place limits' on judges blocking Trump's agenda
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA)
*  Ten months after his arrest, the illegal immigrant accused of murdering Rachel Marin will have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=0.0s)]
*  a pretrial hearing today, with the trial expected to begin later this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=4.9s)]
*  He's also accused of a murder in El Salvador prior to crossing the border in 2023 and another [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=9.92s)]
*  brutal home invasion and assault here in the U.S. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=15.56s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=18.64s)]
*  Greg, this should be about two weeks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=21.32s)]
*  He'll get an attorney, but there is no defense that I could see. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=24.04s)]
*  This guy's going down, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=27.88s)]
*  Yeah, his own DNA, Brian, will likely put him behind bars for the rest of his life. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  It was found on the body of the victim. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=36.04s)]
*  I mean, there are chances it could be somebody else's DNA is astronomical. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  So this kind of powerful scientific evidence, incredibly persuasive in front of a jury. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=42.72s)]
*  But you're right, this guy was a serial predator, wanted in the U.S. for crimes, wanted for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=49.0s)]
*  murder in El Salvador, which is why he fled to the U.S. when Joe Biden opened the borders. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=54.72s)]
*  You know, Biden allowed millions to freely cross over murderers, rapists, gang members, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=60.04s)]
*  no background checks, no vetting and countless innocent victims just like Rachel Marin paid [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=66.28s)]
*  the price with their lives for Biden's insane policy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=73.08s)]
*  And I, you know, it's going to take years and sadly many more violent crimes to catch [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=77.16s)]
*  and evict these people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=83.16s)]
*  So the damage that he did to human life is incalculable. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=84.56s)]
*  And now we've got to spend all this money to put him through a trial. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=89.64s)]
*  He was hiding in a drainage culvert before ambushed in the 37-year-old mother of five. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=91.84s)]
*  Took him 10 months to track him down, but they found him drinking in a bar in Oklahoma. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=98.16s)]
*  So another tragic story. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  And about an hour from now, we're going to have a story again of a legal immigrant criminal [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=104.48s)]
*  who did virtually the same thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=108.52s)]
*  This guy's name was Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=111.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, let's talk about what's happening with this judge shopping to tap into your [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=115.0s)]
*  legal knowledge a little bit more. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=118.72s)]
*  You know, these district judges, 600 strong, are going out of their way to go to stop the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=119.92s)]
*  Trump agenda. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=124.48s)]
*  This is what Trump posted on social media. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=126.12s)]
*  People are shocked by what is going on with the court system. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=128.56s)]
*  I was elected for many reasons, but a principle one was law and order. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=130.84s)]
*  If it was up to district judge Boasberg and other radical left judges, nobody would be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=134.56s)]
*  removed from the country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=139.56s)]
*  The president wouldn't be allowed to do his job and people's lives would be devastated [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  all throughout the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=144.48s)]
*  So now the House is going to pick this up and they're going to try to do something. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=146.2s)]
*  But is this going to be a venting session or is there legal things you can do with these [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  district judges? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, these are activist judges blocking a policy agenda of the president. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=155.76s)]
*  They do it two ways. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  They run to a favorable judge where the outcome against Trump is preordained. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  It's called judge shopping. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=170.44s)]
*  It's unethical. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  But the other thing they're doing, once the judge has been shopped, that judge issues [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=173.32s)]
*  a nationwide injunction against Trump, exerting power they don't have and usurping the power [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  of the president, demolishing the separation of power. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  Look, there's a bill in the House, a bill in the Senate to take away the power of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  judges in the regard I've just described. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=195.4s)]
*  Even if it dies with a filibuster, it's incumbent upon the Supreme Court. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=199.28s)]
*  They have the power under a law passed by Congress to strike down all of these universal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=204.08s)]
*  injunctions and stop it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=210.76s)]
*  You know, even the liberal judges have complained on the Supreme Court about these district [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=213.12s)]
*  court judges exceeding their authority. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  Think about it, 677 district court judges, all of them can overrule and countermand the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=221.76s)]
*  president. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=228.68s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=230.12s)]
*  It's up to John Roberts and the Supreme Court to place limits. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=231.28s)]
*  Yep, it would be great also to not allow the judge shopping. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=235.52s)]
*  Wherever you are and you file, that's where it is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=239.6s)]
*  You don't keep picking Washington, D.C. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=242.88s)]
*  Thanks so much, Greg. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=245.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=246.64s)]
*  Yeah, appreciate it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=247.64s)]
*  I know they passed a law to allow judge shopping. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=248.64s)]
*  Now they should undo that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=250.28s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmi9BO8sMIA&t=251.76s)]
