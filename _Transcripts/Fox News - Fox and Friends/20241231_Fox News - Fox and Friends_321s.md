# A year of anti-Trump media mishaps: 'Embarrassing' propaganda
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4)
*  Yeah, it was a year of misses from the media, especially when it came to their coverage of Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=0.0s)]
*  After years of calling Hunter Biden's laptop a hoax, its authenticity was proven in court. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=5.36s)]
*  And remember what they said about Biden's decline since taking office? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Cheap fakes, videos of real events that are intentionally manipulated to fool viewers, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=16.72s)]
*  released on an RNC opposition research social media account with zero independent fact-checking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  by these so-called journalists and spread throughout the right-wing ecosystem. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=27.84s)]
*  And they are being picked up by news outlets that know they're fakes and or know that they [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=32.56s)]
*  are misleading but post them anyway. Instead of Republicans, you know, focusing on the president's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=38.4s)]
*  performance in office and what he's been able to accomplish, his actual record, they do these cheap [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=43.6s)]
*  fakes. Yeah, someone that isn't cheap or fake is Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce and she joins us [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=49.44s)]
*  now. Tammy, I can't imagine you have any reaction to this. They didn't know it. They didn't know he [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=55.6s)]
*  had cognitive decline. They didn't know the laptop was real. They were just reporting the straight [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=60.88s)]
*  news. That's right. You know, anyone, any reasonable person knew ranging from the laptop to this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=65.36s)]
*  template talk about cheap fakes. We weren't the only ones watching everyone say the same thing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=73.92s)]
*  The media was then immediately also watching each other say the same thing. So what that tells us is [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=80.72s)]
*  they themselves, I would argue, don't even believe what they were saying. That was the narrative. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  That's what they were to say. That was their propaganda to defend the administration. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=92.88s)]
*  And, you know, it's one thing to really believe that. But it's another when you see all of everyone [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=100.0s)]
*  else on other networks, other legacy media repeating that dynamic, which came out of the blue. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=106.08s)]
*  It was a very strange thing. It was like, what, you know, there was deep fakes and now they've [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=112.08s)]
*  got this race cheap fakes. And it was embarrassing, I think, for them, certainly embarrassing for the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=117.12s)]
*  country. But it showed the audiences, which is why the numbers of these other networks continue [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=123.36s)]
*  to suffer. You know, Democrats also want the truth. They want honest information because [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=129.2s)]
*  their families matter as well. And then they look at this and it feels like a drumbeat of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=135.12s)]
*  manipulation and gaslighting and brainwashing. And of course, we finally have with these photographs [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=141.76s)]
*  of Joe Biden with Hunter, his son, and his Chinese associates, a lie that was proven a lie by [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=147.76s)]
*  photographs, which they fought to keep out of the public venue until after the election. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=155.28s)]
*  So all through this, they know what the proof is and their energy is put into keeping it away [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=161.84s)]
*  from the American people, which, of course, is why they're not in power in just a few weeks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=168.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know, some of the repercussions that may come from this, there may be investigations. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Republicans did take the House. They have the opportunity to investigate, you know, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=178.08s)]
*  all of these intel officials that signed off on a letter to say the laptop was Russian [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=182.32s)]
*  propaganda. We come out to come to find out it absolutely was not. Now you have this picture [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=186.56s)]
*  you mentioned, Hunter and Joe meeting with Chinese officials. But the rest of those repercussions [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  that affect our lives on a daily basis are Democrats not going to take the White House. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=197.12s)]
*  President Donald Trump will be the 47th president and he's going to take the White House. You say [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=202.0s)]
*  that Democrats maybe don't want this type of thing, but I don't think any American does. And [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=207.12s)]
*  where do they go from here? The legacy media and the people in the Biden camp and all of these folks, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=211.76s)]
*  if they have protected Biden and they won't admit that they did it, where does their credibility go [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=218.72s)]
*  from here? Well, it goes, if it's impossible to go further down. But there's this this quandary, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=223.6s)]
*  we see it in the newspapers, even on the air on occasions, the pearl clutching about, you know, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=230.72s)]
*  how did this happen? And, you know, we should have Biden says he could have won and he should [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=237.04s)]
*  have stayed in. And they're looking at each other about the I feel they're looking at Donald Trump [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=242.8s)]
*  as an accident, that in fact, they're so perfect and they have sole possession of the truth, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=248.64s)]
*  that only looking at the mistakes they made, and there's plenty, but they're never looking at [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=254.16s)]
*  the policy, what they stand for, what they promoted, what the American people don't want. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=260.0s)]
*  Their answer is if we don't want it, we're racist or sexist or homophobic. Those that's a lie. And [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=265.68s)]
*  the only way they're going to return is by taking the American people seriously, treating them with [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=271.68s)]
*  respect and acknowledging that they need to report on facts, not be mouthpieces for a particular [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=276.8s)]
*  administration. And people get mad at Republicans because, you know, we have arguments about, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  you know, what the facts are on certain policies and what to do. But that's the way we have to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=290.8s)]
*  operate. Yeah, we'll find out who the speaker will be. But at least the American people maybe have a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=294.88s)]
*  little bit more trust in at least President Trump and Republicans right now. Tammy Bruce, thank you [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=299.68s)]
*  for joining us. I hope you have a wonderful new year. Happy end of 2024. Take care. Same to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0dJxJdMVX4&t=303.84s)]
