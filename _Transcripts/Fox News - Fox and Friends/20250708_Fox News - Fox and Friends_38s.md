# White House sets record straight on tariffs: â€˜Got it wrong again' #foxnews #shorts #trump #trade #us
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8)
*  We have the leverage because we're the largest consumer market in the world, because we have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=0.0s)]
*  flexibility about who we can buy from, where we can choose to import from, or to make things [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  domestically ourselves instead. And that gives us the leverage to create a situation in which other [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=9.6s)]
*  people have to ultimately bear the burden of these tariffs. And that's part of why what you're seeing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=14.72s)]
*  in the data is that there's no inflation as a result of these things. There's no increase in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=19.68s)]
*  consumer prices as a result of these tariffs. And if anything, the situation is actually extremely [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=23.92s)]
*  benign. So those who have been very concerned about tariffs have got it wrong again, just as [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=28.48s)]
*  they did in 2018-2019. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMNsl0otC8&t=33.36s)]
