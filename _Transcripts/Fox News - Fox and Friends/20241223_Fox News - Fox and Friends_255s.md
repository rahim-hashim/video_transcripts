# Biden commutes death sentences for 'worst of the worst' killers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU)
*  So there are two days to go until Christmas, of course, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=0.0s)]
*  and some families are getting some shocking news. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  President Biden announcing the commutations [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=5.16s)]
*  of 34 of 40 federal death row inmates, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  those benefiting, including child killers [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=11.0s)]
*  and mass murderers like Jose Oliva Torres, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  who was put behind bars after murdering two little girls [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=17.68s)]
*  and a woman between 2005 and 2009. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Torres stabbed an eight and nine-year-old girl [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  after sexually assaulting them in a Chicago suburb in 2005. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=28.32s)]
*  Then four years later, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=32.88s)]
*  he strangled 20-year-old naval officer Amanda Snell to death [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=34.32s)]
*  in Arlington, Virginia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Another one is convicted murderer Thomas Stephen Sanders. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=40.68s)]
*  He shot a 12-year-old four times, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=43.64s)]
*  cut her throat in Louisiana back in 2010. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=46.24s)]
*  He now gets life. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=49.2s)]
*  The Attorney General Merrick Garland [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=50.58s)]
*  recommending to President Biden [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  all but a handful of these death sentences be commuted. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=53.24s)]
*  Now, the exceptions include Boston Marathon bomber [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=56.66s)]
*  Jokhar Tsarnaev, Pittsburgh synagogue killer Robert Bowers, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  and the church shooter down in South Carolina, Dylan Roof, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=64.7s)]
*  all very high profile, all with political sensitivities. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=67.56s)]
*  But I would imagine if you are a loved one [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=72.44s)]
*  of any of the other 37, you're like, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=74.94s)]
*  well, okay, you made these three exceptions [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=77.17999999999999s)]
*  for stories people have heard about. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=79.3s)]
*  What about our justice? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=81.12s)]
*  What about our kid? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=82.78s)]
*  And look, I'm actually against a death penalty [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=83.62s)]
*  in cases where there's any ambiguity about guilt whatsoever. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=85.48s)]
*  But some of these people, absolute stone cold killers [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=89.36s)]
*  proven beyond any doubt. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=92.68s)]
*  And Joe Biden comes in in the final days of his presidency [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=94.48s)]
*  and waves this wand. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=97.44s)]
*  And I think we're gonna hear from some of these families [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=98.92s)]
*  very, very unhappy about this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=101.0s)]
*  I mean, if you were shocked by the 1500 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  that he commuted the sentences, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=105.76s)]
*  this should shock you to the core. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=107.0s)]
*  So these people are going from being on death row [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=108.54s)]
*  to serving life in prison, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=111.56s)]
*  which means that they're waking up happy today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=113.84s)]
*  So can you imagine being the mother [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=116.48s)]
*  of those two little girls who were murdered [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=118.96s)]
*  and hear that the Biden administration [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=121.5s)]
*  is going to give the killer of your children a win? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=124.1s)]
*  And the thinking behind the scenes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  in excluding the three people, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=130.04s)]
*  Dylan Roof and Zokhar Zarnayev [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=132.68s)]
*  and the other individual [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=135.04s)]
*  that's not getting a sentence commuted [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=135.88s)]
*  is that they were the worst killers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=137.6s)]
*  so that they can't do that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=139.48s)]
*  You're gonna look at a mother and say [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=140.68s)]
*  that the man that killed her two daughters [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=142.38s)]
*  is not among the worst. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=145.0s)]
*  How do you judge that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=146.74s)]
*  How do you have the moral compass to do that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=147.82s)]
*  You just gotta wonder if he's doing any of this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=150.66s)]
*  So 37 of 40 are going to get, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=152.78s)]
*  37 of 40 will get life instead of death. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=155.94s)]
*  And why would he do this? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=159.26s)]
*  Well, he's gonna go visit the pope [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  and the pope is against the death penalty. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=162.9s)]
*  And maybe he's trying to expunge, you know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=165.38s)]
*  have one thing because he's also campaigned [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=167.18s)]
*  on the fact how much he loves abortion. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=170.38s)]
*  So as a Catholic, you're gonna go see the pope. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=173.34s)]
*  It's like, hey, yeah, I'm pro-abortion [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=174.62s)]
*  but on the good side is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=176.98s)]
*  I'm gonna save some of the death penalty. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  So I'll let the, I'll let the, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=180.46s)]
*  the killers. I'll let the fetus die [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  but I'll let the murderers live. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=183.9s)]
*  That is so true. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=185.7s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=186.54s)]
*  I do sympathize with people who are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=187.36s)]
*  against the death penalty. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=189.34s)]
*  But what Joe Biden should have done, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=192.18s)]
*  if he wanted to leave his mark on this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=194.86s)]
*  is something that he didn't do. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=196.54s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal says the administration [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=197.44s)]
*  didn't give priority to bills [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=199.46s)]
*  to end federal capital punishment when he was in office. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=201.02s)]
*  Didn't follow through on his campaign pledge [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  to call on states to eliminate the death penalty. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=206.84s)]
*  If he wanted to make this a priority [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  during his administration, that's what he should have done. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  Not at the 11th hour, commute these sentences [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=213.86s)]
*  and rob people of the justice that they thought they had. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=216.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, and the other thing is Carly, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  he's presenting this in the statement [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=220.9s)]
*  that was written for him, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  The administration is presenting this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=223.72s)]
*  as a principled stance against the death penalty. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=225.62s)]
*  He's like, you know, we're, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=228.34s)]
*  we're against capital punishment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=229.18s)]
*  We're not gonna let the next guy come in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=231.38s)]
*  and carry out these executions when we had a moratorium. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=232.22s)]
*  Okay, if you're so principled, why the exceptions, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=236.74s)]
*  Principals don't have exceptions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=240.9s)]
*  Political blowback. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=242.62s)]
*  Politics, it's all about politics. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=243.46s)]
*  So if you're one of the 37 other families, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=245.3s)]
*  sorry, your politics didn't matter as much [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=247.74s)]
*  than those three, which they flagged for political reasons, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  which is very different than a principled stand. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z9q9FO-PTU&t=252.78s)]
