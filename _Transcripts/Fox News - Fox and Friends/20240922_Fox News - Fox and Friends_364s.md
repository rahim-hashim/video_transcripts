# Dems have a ‘monopoly on compassion,’ GOP rep says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU)
*  Sir, don't you understand that Maduro is laughing at us? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=0.0s)]
*  We are going to continue to consider the whole range of sanctioning options that we have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=5.44s)]
*  available based on what we see from Maduro, how the situation develops, as well as what [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  we think is going to be the most effective response. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=16.88s)]
*  Sir, you're sending a very weak message to Maduro. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=20.36s)]
*  I'm sure they're analyzing this hearing to the T. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Our next guest calling out the Biden administration for not enforcing oil sanctions during a time [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=30.0s)]
*  of deep political corruption in Venezuela. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=35.24s)]
*  Joining us now with more from that exchange, House Foreign Affairs Committee member, Congresswoman [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Maria Salazar. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=42.04s)]
*  Maria, explain to our audience what's happening there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=43.04s)]
*  What is the Biden administration doing with regards to Venezuela and what we know was [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=46.72s)]
*  a rigged election? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  And what should they do in order to not project this weakness that you call it? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=54.6s)]
*  Very, very weak. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  The Biden administration is, Biden-Harris administration, they are solely responsible [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  for what's happening in Venezuela right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=67.32s)]
*  Venezuelans said that if Maduro stays in power, four million more Venezuelans are going to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=70.12s)]
*  be knocking on our southern border. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=75.16s)]
*  Four million more people. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=77.8s)]
*  All right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=79.08s)]
*  So Biden signed an accord with Maduro saying, we are going to allow Chevron to sell your [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=80.08s)]
*  oil so then you can have more money in your pocket if you accept the results of the presidential [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=86.92s)]
*  election. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=92.76s)]
*  So now they're selling oil and they have one point five billion dollars in their pockets [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=93.76s)]
*  in the last few months and they did not respect the presidential, the results of the presidential [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  election. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  So what do you think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris should do at this moment? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  Same thing that Ronald Reagan did in 1989 when the Sandinistas were giving free and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=107.76s)]
*  fair elections and they lost. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  You pick up the phone and you said you signed an accord, we, the United States, we're telling [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  you that you have to commit to and fulfill what you committed to. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=118.04s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=122.48s)]
*  And then say to Chevron and to Repsoil and to all the oil industries that are there, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=123.48s)]
*  you got to pause. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=127.92s)]
*  No more selling of oil, no more money to the repressive apparatus, no more money to Maduro. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=129.56s)]
*  And I am sure that Maduro will negotiate with Biden and Harris. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=134.72s)]
*  It's just that that phone call has not been made. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=138.32s)]
*  And the message that we're sending to the rest of the world, Latin America, the Middle [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=140.86s)]
*  East, is that the White House is weak on dictators. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=144.74s)]
*  Period. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  That's the message. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  It's so scary. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  And for more million people coming in. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you have the Tren del Agua right here in this city. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  Come on, you know, this is Venezuela. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure you have thousands of people that are really good, that want to come ask a claim [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=158.46s)]
*  for political asylum, but you have thousands of thugs coming because, because we don't [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  have leadership of the White House. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=169.86s)]
*  And how much of this is pressure from the oil companies on the Biden administration? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=171.3s)]
*  Well, the oil companies are out there to make money. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=175.78s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=178.5s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=179.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm pro-capitalism. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=180.5s)]
*  I'm pro- you make a lot of money, energy sector. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=181.5s)]
*  No problem. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=183.94s)]
*  But not in this occasion because you are profiting from people's lives and you are causing major [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=184.94s)]
*  migration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=191.06s)]
*  We should just be producing our own oil and then we wouldn't have to worry about all this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  We'd have a lot more power and leverage over these dictators. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=198.22s)]
*  Let's move to this topic, which is that Trump is outperforming his 2020 support among Hispanics [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=199.26s)]
*  who prefer him on immigration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=204.58s)]
*  The poll shows as the former- this is what the polls show as the former president calls [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=206.66s)]
*  on Congress to ban sanctuary cities. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=210.86s)]
*  So let's just talk about this because it's really- this is an amazing thing that we're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=214.18s)]
*  seeing in this cycle. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=218.82s)]
*  So you have Donald Trump, who the left has tried to smear as a racist because of his [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=220.5s)]
*  position on immigration. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=224.9s)]
*  He hasn't backed out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=226.46s)]
*  In fact, he's running on mass deportation and he's winning with Hispanics. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=227.54s)]
*  Help us understand why that's happening. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=233.34s)]
*  The economy, woke and socialism. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=234.7s)]
*  The economy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=238.26s)]
*  If you're Hispanic and you go to the supermarket, eggs are 10 bucks. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=239.26s)]
*  It doesn't mean that because you're a Democrat, every registered Democrat, you're going to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  have cheaper eggs or milk or bread. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  Number two, woke. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=250.22s)]
*  We're not woke. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=251.22s)]
*  Once again said, Republicans, I mean, Hispanics are Republicans. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=253.22s)]
*  They just don't know it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=257.78s)]
*  Very true. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=259.18s)]
*  God-fearing, law-abiding, taxpaying, small governments. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=260.18s)]
*  We come here to work, not to get a handout. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=263.38s)]
*  So the economy woke. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=265.94s)]
*  I mean, talking about sex to kids in kindergarten. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=267.58s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=270.38s)]
*  Well, tell me, when does that happen in this culture? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=271.38s)]
*  And at the end, socialism. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=274.1s)]
*  We are not socialist. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=275.82s)]
*  We're not perfect, but we're not socialists. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=276.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=278.9s)]
*  Well, I think that sums it up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=279.9s)]
*  It sounds like Donald Trump has his pulse on just Americans who happen to be Hispanics. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=280.9s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=285.85999999999996s)]
*  And people who want the best for the country, that want to continue with the American exceptionality. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=286.85999999999996s)]
*  Remember that, I mean, you understand we come from the largest or at least I'm one of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  representatives of the largest minority in the country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=296.17999999999995s)]
*  We're 20 percent of the population. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=299.58s)]
*  We want to live a dignified life in the promised land. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=302.08s)]
*  We don't want handouts. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=305.9s)]
*  We want opportunities. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=307.14s)]
*  We want to work hard and be proud of, you know, if you're Mexican-American, you love [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=308.26s)]
*  your roots, but you're happy to be here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=314.06s)]
*  You want to live a dignified life. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=316.38s)]
*  You don't want to see what's happening right now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  And another thing that I just want to say is that Dems always claim that they have the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=320.74s)]
*  moral ground. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=325.46s)]
*  So they have the monopoly on compassion. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=326.46s)]
*  We're compassionate, too. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=328.9s)]
*  We're giving the Hispanics an opportunity to grow and work and live. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=329.9s)]
*  When you've lost 300,000 mostly Hispanic children, Latin American children, to sex [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=333.94s)]
*  slavery and trafficking at the border, you really can't claim the mantle of compassion. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=339.98s)]
*  And no DNA testing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=343.74s)]
*  No DNA testing, which is, I mean, 80... [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=344.94s)]
*  They fought for that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=346.78s)]
*  The Democrats fought for no DNA testing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=347.78s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=349.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=350.74s)]
*  Thank you, Congresswoman Salazar. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=351.74s)]
*  My pleasure to be here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=352.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbs3MWMNJU&t=353.74s)]
