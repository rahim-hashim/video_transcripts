# I don't think Kamala Harris could pull this off: Gasparino
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54)
*  Kamala Harris opting to skip the Al Smith dinner here in New York City next month, making [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=0.0s)]
*  her the first nominee to pass up the invite since Walter Mondale in 1984. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=5.64s)]
*  But the event, which benefits Catholic charities, can expect Donald Trump to be there just like [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=12.0s)]
*  he was in 2016 with Hillary Clinton and in 2020 when he gave video remarks during COVID. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  Our next guest predicted this exact scenario nearly a month ago. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=24.52s)]
*  Fox Business correspondent and author of Go Woke, Go Broke, Charles Gasparino joins us now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=27.96s)]
*  Charlie, what did you predict a month ago that we would just have a campaign that is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=33.04s)]
*  manufactured and not exposed to public scrutiny? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=36.24s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=40.2s)]
*  I mean, listen, like a broken clock, you know, what can I tell you? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=41.2s)]
*  I mean, I just reported it out and it was kind of an overlooked story. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=46.08s)]
*  The Al Smith dinner takes on greater significance during the presidential year where these presidential [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=49.56s)]
*  candidates get up there usually, unless some major, major scheduling thing at the last minute [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=55.36s)]
*  or a disinvite. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Bill Clinton got disinvited by Cardinal O'Connor [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=62.08s)]
*  because of partial birth abortion or some issue over abortion. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=68.56s)]
*  But you know, barring some of these sort of extraneous circumstances, the presidential [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=73.84s)]
*  candidates go there during the presidential year. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=79.52s)]
*  They throw sharp elbows at each other. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=83.2s)]
*  It's a freewheeling thing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=85.2s)]
*  You know, Trump went at it with Hillary in 2016, which I suggest you go back and YouTube [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=87.0s)]
*  it because it's hysterical. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he threw some. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  He talked about her email server, made fun of it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  People were laughing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=97.44s)]
*  She came back to him and said that Trump's speech was translated from the original Russian, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=99.2s)]
*  which was really funny at the time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, it takes a certain type of self-awareness and confidence, being able [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=107.24s)]
*  to speak on your feet, to really engage in this sort of banter. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=113.88s)]
*  I mean, this is high level, throwing elbows at each other in a funny way. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  And she just doesn't have it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=125.0s)]
*  So, you know, when I did the story a month ago, I asked why is no one was talking about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=127.32s)]
*  this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=131.88s)]
*  This was theoretically a soft debate where people were saying how many debates they would [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=132.88s)]
*  have. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=136.92s)]
*  They should probably have a debate at the Al Smith dinner. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=137.92s)]
*  When I did my research, I found out that, yeah, Trump's going to go. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=140.4s)]
*  Oh, you know, 99 percent sure, unless something happens. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=143.84s)]
*  She's not going to go. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=149.16s)]
*  And lo and behold, last night it started to leak. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=150.72s)]
*  It's funny how they leaked it simultaneously to CNN while they called the Archdiocese. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=153.12s)]
*  This is essentially what I heard from the Archdiocese while they called the Archdiocese. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=159.52s)]
*  And I talked to the people at the Archdiocese and they confirmed everything, including Trump [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=165.4s)]
*  made the call right after the story broke that he will attend. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, Charlie, I don't think most of our viewers are familiar with the Al Smith dinner. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=174.68s)]
*  The format, does it does each candidate give a speech and is a certain amount of time? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=179.52s)]
*  You said it's a quasi debate. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=183.96s)]
*  So it's kind of roast. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=185.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=186.74s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=187.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's a roast. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=188.74s)]
*  Let's just talk about what the Al Smith dinner is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=189.74s)]
*  Al Smith was the great governor of New York, populist, working man, governor of the 1920s. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=192.4s)]
*  He was one of the top guys in the Democratic Party. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=197.52s)]
*  I believe he actually ran for president one year. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=200.12s)]
*  He grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and came from poverty to become one of the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=203.32s)]
*  most powerful people in the country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=209.72s)]
*  The dinner is named after him and it supports Catholic charities and it's put on by the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  Archdiocese. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=216.6s)]
*  So the so the Cardinal O'Connor, in this case, Dolan will be there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=217.6s)]
*  Usually it's headlined by a a it's the headliners are the presidential candidates during presidential [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=222.36s)]
*  years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  But you know, there's a comedian that usually intros people and it's it's funny. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  And it's by the way, it's not for the faint of heart because you got to go in there prepared. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=233.4s)]
*  You got to know what you got to. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=237.0s)]
*  You got to be funny. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=238.72000000000003s)]
*  You know, when you think back at it, I don't think her cackle would work very well at the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  Al Smith dinner. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  I think this is I mean, I don't mean to make make light of this, but her personal demeanor, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=247.84s)]
*  the way she comports herself would be mocked. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=254.48s)]
*  Tremendous. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=257.64s)]
*  I don't think she could pull it off at something like this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=258.64s)]
*  I think. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=260.72s)]
*  Well, I think it's you know what I find interesting, Charles, and this is not to demean the event. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=261.72s)]
*  I do think I like the bipartisan nature of that event. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=266.12s)]
*  I like politicians being self-deprecating and and bringing the country together in that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=269.2s)]
*  way. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=274.56s)]
*  And I think that the charities is under a lot of scrutiny these days. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=275.64s)]
*  They are in bed with the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=278.64s)]
*  Many people say it's neither Catholic nor charity because they're the these are the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=281.64s)]
*  NGOs that are bringing working with the government to bring illegals across the border and have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=285.12s)]
*  turned a blind eye to the child sex trafficking that is happening as a result of this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=290.08s)]
*  We've lost 300000 children. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=295.44s)]
*  So I'm not trying to be, you know, you know, boo boo the whole thing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=297.16s)]
*  But it's a it's a it's a big deal. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=301.48s)]
*  She's not going to be there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=303.2s)]
*  That's not that's not why she's not doing this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=304.2s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=306.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=307.88s)]
*  I will say this. I don't I'm not an expert at the Catholic charities. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=308.88s)]
*  I do delve into the world of NGOs and how they and I do this in my book, Go Loco, about [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=311.92s)]
*  radicalization of various entities like this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=318.32s)]
*  I don't know if Cardinal Dolan, though, is a lefty and you know, he may not, but he may [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=321.48s)]
*  not also be calling out the NGOs. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=327.48s)]
*  I don't know. We'll have to ask him about that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=329.04s)]
*  But that's interesting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=331.2s)]
*  Charlie, thank you for breaking it down. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=332.72s)]
*  You saw it before we did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=334.44000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks, Charles. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=335.6s)]
*  Thanks, Charles. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3dh-_RO54&t=336.6s)]
