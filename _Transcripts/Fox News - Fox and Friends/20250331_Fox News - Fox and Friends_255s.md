# State's GOP HQ targeted in alleged arson attack, officials investigating as hate crime
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw)
*  So early Sunday, the Republican Party of New Mexico headquarters was the subject of what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=0.0s)]
*  the party chair is calling a deliberate act of arson. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=8.1s)]
*  The building's front entrance was completely destroyed and graffiti reading ICE equal KKK [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=11.6s)]
*  was spray painted on the side. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=17.48s)]
*  Joining us now is the chairwoman of the Republican Party of New Mexico, Amy Barella. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=20.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining the program. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=26.7s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=29.8s)]
*  So, Amy, I want to play this soundbite first from one of the members of Congress and get [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=30.8s)]
*  your reaction. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=37.32s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=38.32s)]
*  How are we going to respond? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=39.32s)]
*  Because people keep asking about me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=41.32s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=42.96s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=43.96s)]
*  What more can you do? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=44.96s)]
*  And we have a three-pronged project. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=45.96s)]
*  Legislate, litigate, agitate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=48.96s)]
*  And you guys are part of the agitate part. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=52.16s)]
*  So don't feel like we are hopeless or helpless. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=54.16s)]
*  When we express our outwage and it is universal, they are forced to put it back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  The congresswoman later said this in an ex post after the attack. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=64.44s)]
*  Political violence is unacceptable, including the arson attack on New Mexico's GOP headquarters. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  The perpetrators must be held accountable. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=74.34s)]
*  Every American should be able to freely and safely participate in our democracy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=75.88s)]
*  At my town hall yesterday, I spoke about love and action, about the importance of showing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=80.44s)]
*  respect and listening. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=84.92s)]
*  This is what we need right now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=86.82s)]
*  Now obviously that was a softer term in tone before, after the fact of this bombing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=89.02s)]
*  What do you have to say about it? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=98.22s)]
*  Well, I believe that she changed her statement as soon as I came out to the media and was [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=99.78s)]
*  calling her out on those statements. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=105.34s)]
*  You're holding a town hall to discuss about the love of the community and you use the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=107.41999999999999s)]
*  words agitate I think is contradictory. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=112.41999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so don't you think the temperature just needs to be lowered? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=114.98s)]
*  It looks like it's coming from one side right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=119.46s)]
*  I think spirited debate is great, but it's clear that they're targeting Tesla, Republicans, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=122.62s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=128.5s)]
*  When is it going to end? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=129.5s)]
*  It ends with the left calling out and just instead of calling out for violence and the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=133.26s)]
*  destruction of the United States and across New Mexico, how about we come to the table [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=139.66s)]
*  and work together and fix the crime problems in New Mexico instead? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=143.76s)]
*  Yeah, so Madam Chairwoman, can you give us some details exactly what happened that day? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  So while it's still under investigation, we do know that there was some sort of device [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=155.12s)]
*  to start a fire placed in front of the doorway about or around 1 a.m. and that the ignition [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=161.44s)]
*  was about 5 a.m. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=167.88s)]
*  Yeah, was anyone anticipated or supposed to be in the building at the time of this attack? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=170.4s)]
*  No, thankfully not. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  And that's been one of my worries for the last few months is with all this going on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=179.4s)]
*  across the United States, I'm really worried about our safety of our staff. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you think it's okay for you to reopen your facility or are you guys taking extra security [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=188.44s)]
*  precautions going forward? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=193.94s)]
*  We will probably be in remodeling for two to three months, so we are going to temporarily [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=197.32s)]
*  relocate in a different community that hopefully has a lower crime rate that we can feel safer [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  in and we will address the security system as we move it back into our old headquarters. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=207.72s)]
*  Have you talked to the FBI or anybody about this since this was clearly a political attack? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=212.88s)]
*  This has been deemed a hate crime and I know that they're going to be back today to do [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=219.32s)]
*  more investigations and collect more cameras from the neighboring businesses. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=223.98s)]
*  So yes, we are in close contact with ATF and the FBI and the Attorney General did reach [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=229.06s)]
*  out to me yesterday as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=235.26s)]
*  We're praying for you folks right there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=238.1s)]
*  Hopefully we can get the temperature down just a little bit. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=239.54s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=242.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb8qPvlcaUw&t=244.29999999999998s)]
