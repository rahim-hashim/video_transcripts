# Wisconsin voters can ‘see through’ Tammy Baldwin’s ‘radical’ campaign: Hovde
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA)
*  Wisconsin is a major swing state for presidential election, but it could be a deciding factor as well for the Senate's balance of power a new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=0.0s)]
*  Report previously saying that the state was leaning towards reelecting Democrat Senator Tammy Baldwin [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=7.36s)]
*  Now calling the race a toss-up Eric Huvde joins us now. He is running in that Senate race [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=12.72s)]
*  Eric great to see you. Why has it changed? Why is it now a toss-up? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=20.76s)]
*  Well, first of all, good morning to man [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=25.16s)]
*  It sounds like they're having quite a party out at BYU. We should all be there. But look as it pertains to my race [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=27.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's all the polls show it's now, you know 50 50 50 [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=34.260000000000005s)]
*  149 or vice versa so I really think it comes down to a couple basic things [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=40.08s)]
*  one I'm talking about issues that matter to the people of Wisconsin about what's happened to their [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=45.92s)]
*  their wallets and how [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=51.44s)]
*  How the inflation that Joe Biden and Tammy Baldwin supported all of the spending has really impacted [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=53.32s)]
*  their their ability to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=60.2s)]
*  buy food [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=63.28s)]
*  groceries [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=65.12s)]
*  energy costs housing costs [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=66.78s)]
*  Car insurance all the rest the open border [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=69.56s)]
*  Obviously, that's a big issue [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=73.08s)]
*  I've been talking about health care how health care costs continue to go up and access to health care continues to go down [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=74.4s)]
*  Affordable housing for young people so I'm focused on issues that matter her campaign conversely [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=81.66s)]
*  All she's done is lie. I mean it's it's the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=89.1s)]
*  Rather remarkable that literally every single campaign ad is either an attack [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  Complete crazy lie about me like I want to take older people Social Security away or I support a national abortion ban [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=99.78s)]
*  I never supported that and of course I don't want I want to protect Social Security. They're the one bankrupting it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=107.28s)]
*  So I think it's I think people are seeing through her whole campaign [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=114.6s)]
*  So I think those are the two reasons and lastly I'm out there every single day talking to people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=119.64s)]
*  Giving speeches doing interviews. She's like Kamala Harris. I mean she barely gets interviewed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=126.08s)]
*  She barely does any events and she's just trying to coast through so I think those are the reasons [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=131.98s)]
*  Well, that's been her mo for years Eric. I mean she's been hiding forever [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=136.9s)]
*  I don't think anybody really [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=140.9s)]
*  This might be the first time her radical record has really been exposed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=143.38s)]
*  I heard that she didn't want to have Kamala Harris come campaign with her. Is that right? I [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=148.1s)]
*  Think that may be the case, you know, remember she said that Joe Biden was the most [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=154.74s)]
*  Successful president of her lifetime a week before he blows up in the debate and then she runs from supporting him [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=160.7s)]
*  And then she fully embraces Kamala Harris and now she doesn't want to be seen around with her [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=168.46s)]
*  She doesn't know what to do [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=174.62s)]
*  Again, she she always masquerades back in the state as a moderate and yet [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=177.3s)]
*  This is a senator who literally school boards are now fighting against the Department of Education and Agriculture [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=182.9s)]
*  To get their funds if they don't want to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  Change title 9 to allow guys to play in girls sports or guys to go in girls locker rooms and bathrooms [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=193.7s)]
*  And so we have school boards pushing back and this is what the federal government's trying to force and they're saying to school boards [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  If you don't accept it will withhold money from you. So she's so radical on every single thing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=207.3s)]
*  So we're just continuing to point out these issues charging hard [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=214.82s)]
*  Feel really good about it need all the support go to Eric of the comm but yeah, things are really going well [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=218.74s)]
*  It seems like every time we interview you the Baldwin lead shrinks even more and more and more [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=225.18s)]
*  It's a trend going in your direction. We'll see if it continues over the next three weeks Eric. Hovde. Thank you for your time [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNUlMSXNiA&t=230.02s)]
