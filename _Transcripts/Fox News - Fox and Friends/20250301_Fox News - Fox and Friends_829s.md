# Peter Doocy: The Democrats have amnesia about this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y)
*  So, you know, my first day on the White House beat was Joe Biden's first day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I've seen many of these oval sprays. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=5.12s)]
*  Some of them can be kind of boring. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=6.78s)]
*  Yesterday, top of the list, most interesting, possibly most consequential. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=8.76s)]
*  And this president, Donald Trump, who's been asking federal workers for five things that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=15.44s)]
*  they did last week, all he was asking Zelensky was to say thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=19.64s)]
*  Just say thank you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=26.96s)]
*  And he wouldn't do it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=27.96s)]
*  Truly amazing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=30.64s)]
*  You know, it's funny in this environment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=31.64s)]
*  So I keep my texts at zero. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=34.0s)]
*  That's like the one thing I always clear out are all my texts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=36.32s)]
*  But I was in the air. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  I was flying at the same time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  When I landed, I opened up, you know, you turn your phone on and I had like 70 texts. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=42.04s)]
*  Everybody going, oh my gosh, did you see this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=47.16s)]
*  Oh my gosh, are you watching this? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=49.16s)]
*  And then at that point, I'm like, oh no, something bad has happened. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=51.68s)]
*  And you just have a lot of friends who are in the rare earth minerals business. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=54.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=57.76s)]
*  All of my rare earth dealers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=58.76s)]
*  Well here is that moment that the entire, listen, this is reverberating across the world [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=61.48s)]
*  and sending messages to other leaders as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=66.2s)]
*  Here is this exchange that has just everyone riveted. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=69.12s)]
*  We signed ceasefire. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=75.24s)]
*  Ceasefire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=77.52s)]
*  All of them told me that he will never go. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=78.52s)]
*  We signed him a gas contract. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=81.84s)]
*  Gas contract. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=84.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=85.8s)]
*  He broke the ceasefire. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=87.24s)]
*  He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=89.44s)]
*  We signed the exchange of prisoners. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=93.2s)]
*  But he didn't do it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=95.32s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=97.6s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=100.8s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=102.8s)]
*  Yes, but if you are not strong. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=106.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=107.4s)]
*  into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=110.72s)]
*  I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=113.8s)]
*  you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=119.28s)]
*  Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=122.28s)]
*  And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=130.6s)]
*  country? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  A lot of questions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  With us you start having cards. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  Right now you don't have your playing cards. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  You're playing cards. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=143.36s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=144.36s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=147.36s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=149.36s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=152.36s)]
*  Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you you take it so the bullets stop [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=157.36s)]
*  flying and your men stop getting killed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=161.96s)]
*  Of course we want to stop the war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=163.96s)]
*  But you're saying you don't want a ceasefire? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=164.96s)]
*  But I said to you, with guarantees. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=165.96s)]
*  I want a ceasefire because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=166.96s)]
*  Ask our people about ceasefire. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=171.84s)]
*  What do they think? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=172.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter for you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=173.84s)]
*  That wasn't with me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=174.84s)]
*  That wasn't with me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=175.84s)]
*  That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=176.84s)]
*  That was with Obama. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=181.84s)]
*  That was with Obama who gave you sheets and I gave you javelins. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=182.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=187.84s)]
*  I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=188.84s)]
*  Obama gave you sheets. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=191.84s)]
*  In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=193.84s)]
*  You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=199.72s)]
*  With us, you have the cards. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=203.72s)]
*  But without us, you don't have any cards. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=205.72s)]
*  And we don't know how Zelensky misread the situation so much, but we know what he missed, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=208.72s)]
*  right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=214.72s)]
*  It's not Trump's money. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=215.72s)]
*  It's not Biden's money. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=216.72s)]
*  It's American taxpayer money. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=217.72s)]
*  It's people that just elected Trump that he is still in touch with, you know, he still [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=219.72s)]
*  feels a connection to, who are complaining that they can't afford eggs right now and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=225.14s)]
*  that everything is so expensive. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=229.06s)]
*  And then we're pouring $300 billion a year into Ukraine. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=230.34s)]
*  And you know, Donald Trump did something that at my house, we sometimes have to do with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=235.4s)]
*  the two-year-old, they say if your toddler is having a tantrum, sometimes the only thing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=239.74s)]
*  that you can do is just take them to another, remove them, and let them cry it out. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=245.22s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=250.24s)]
*  He's on timeout. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=251.24s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=252.24s)]
*  He's on timeout. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=253.24s)]
*  Listen, I think that the attitude that he had coming into this is fascinating. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=254.56s)]
*  First of all, let's just talk about that we're even seeing this, that Donald Trump has allowed [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=258.72s)]
*  the curtain to be pulled so that the world can see what an exchange like this looks like [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=262.88s)]
*  and also see who Zelensky is because he's been sort of propped up as this like, you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  know, George Washington figure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  This this and yet you see the way he acted in here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=274.56s)]
*  He literally believes everything the elites and the neocons told him about himself. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=278.52s)]
*  He didn't seem to realize that USAID actually paid the celebrities who came in to see him. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=284.52s)]
*  He's believing his own sort of Euro press. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=290.32s)]
*  And and and he comes into this meeting with that attitude. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=294.08s)]
*  And you know, listen, I saw a lot of alpha male energy coming from Donald Trump, from [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=299.44s)]
*  J.D. Vance saying, listen, I don't know what the other guy did before me, but this is a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=306.0s)]
*  new sheriff. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=311.68s)]
*  We're going to end this war because a lot of people have died. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  He did. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  J.D. Vance talked about how they're forcing conscripts up. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  I've read stories that they even had took men with Down syndrome and recruited them [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  and forced them into Vance to recruit them to go into this meat grinder of a war. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  This has been a brutal war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump said to him, you are gambling with World War Three and we're not going to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  pay for this. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=337.54s)]
*  And of course, after that explosive meeting, Zelensky canceled all of his interviews with [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=338.54s)]
*  American media after that, except for our own Bret Baer. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=345.3s)]
*  But then he went on with Bret Baer last night on Special Report and did not take the opportunity [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=348.74s)]
*  to apologize. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=354.06s)]
*  Do you think your relationship with Donald Trump, President Trump after today can be [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=356.54s)]
*  salvaged? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=362.98s)]
*  Yes, of course, because it's relations more than to President. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  The historical relations, strong relations between our people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=376.06s)]
*  And that's why I always began with to thank your people, from our people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=381.3s)]
*  And this is the most important. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=387.66s)]
*  And of course, thankful to President and of course to Congress. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=389.62s)]
*  But first of all, to your people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  Your people help to save our people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=395.14s)]
*  Based on everything that we know about what happened yesterday, Zelensky thinks he's going [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  to get a better deal from, that he can get a better deal from Donald Trump by holding [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=402.32s)]
*  out. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=407.7s)]
*  From everything that we know about Donald Trump, that's not going to happen. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=408.7s)]
*  And these Zelensky political geniuses should have told him beforehand that it's possible [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  JD Vance or somebody in the room might bring up that he did campaign alongside these Democrats [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=418.46s)]
*  in the 2024 cycle because there is one person in the world with an encyclopedia in their [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=423.9s)]
*  mind of everybody, whoever campaigned with a Democrat or another Republican. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=430.06s)]
*  And that is Donald Trump. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=434.74s)]
*  And we've got this video. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=436.98s)]
*  There they are in Scranton, Pennsylvania. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=438.42s)]
*  Zelensky went to Battleground PA with Josh Shapiro, the number one Harris surrogate for [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=439.7s)]
*  a while once Biden was sidelined. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=448.26s)]
*  And Bob Casey, who is running, is right there behind him. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=450.3s)]
*  He lost. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=452.66s)]
*  And they were watching these missiles that the U.S. was paying for and sending over to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=453.8s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=458.5s)]
*  Look, he's signing them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=459.5s)]
*  And he was acting like he didn't know what Vance is talking about. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=460.5s)]
*  Oh, you went and campaigned with the opposition. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=462.82s)]
*  That's what he's talking about. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=465.18s)]
*  Not only did that happen, but I believe Donald Trump tried to report this as foreign interference [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=466.38s)]
*  in this election. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, repulsive signing these bombs that are going to kill. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes, in the same outfit that you were to the Oval Office, by the way, at the bomb factory. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=477.38s)]
*  He has one costume. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=480.86s)]
*  And of course, foreign interference also being the premise of the entire first sham impeachment [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=482.54s)]
*  against Donald Trump in the first place. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=489.98s)]
*  So it's kind of worth noting that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=492.2s)]
*  But it also goes back to the point with Zelensky. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=496.17999999999995s)]
*  You have no cards, bro. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=498.58s)]
*  The only cards you have are the cards that President Trump is providing you or the American [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=500.38s)]
*  people are providing you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=504.76s)]
*  That's the only reason you're here in the first place. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=506.61999999999995s)]
*  And for him to get all cheeky and talk about, oh, no, we're not playing cards here, like [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=508.9s)]
*  refusing to accept. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=514.78s)]
*  It's like dealing with like a drunk, insolent teenager trying to have a logical debate with [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=517.92s)]
*  him. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=522.3s)]
*  And he's just being like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=523.3s)]
*  And you can't be surprised that it ends up pissing off Donald Trump. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=525.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=529.54s)]
*  And J.D. Vance. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=530.54s)]
*  And everybody else. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=531.54s)]
*  I think the role of Vance in this was so fascinating. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=532.54s)]
*  The way he and Trump are tag teaming on this and that they're both on the same America [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=536.02s)]
*  First page. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=542.18s)]
*  It's bad cop and better cop. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=543.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=544.98s)]
*  So no surprise, Democrats took that America First exchange that you just saw. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=546.58s)]
*  And they're on the side of Zelensky. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=553.3s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=554.74s)]
*  President Trump wants to look tough. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=555.74s)]
*  It's important for the American people to understand because of what happened today, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=557.98s)]
*  we are all less safe. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=561.66s)]
*  They're going to be happy about this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  Putin and his cronies are probably popping champagne bottles right now. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=564.46s)]
*  What we just witnessed between Donald Trump, J.D. Vance and President Zelensky inside the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=568.3s)]
*  White House was an ambush. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=573.1s)]
*  It was a planned ambush designed to embarrass President Zelensky in order to benefit Vladimir [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=575.66s)]
*  Putin. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=581.54s)]
*  That was an embarrassment. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=583.5799999999999s)]
*  That was an abomination. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=585.0999999999999s)]
*  The president of the United States is a coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=586.4599999999999s)]
*  It's just embarrassing that the only hero in the Oval Office, the only decent human [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=591.5s)]
*  being for that matter, is the Ukrainian. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=598.16s)]
*  It's a very sad day and an embarrassment for the United States on the world stage. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=602.38s)]
*  But let's step back and analyze what's happened here. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=608.14s)]
*  I think there's no question that this was a setup. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=612.06s)]
*  You heard Donald Trump say at the end of that clip you played, this is great television. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=616.38s)]
*  This was a setup. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=621.26s)]
*  You know what was a setup? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=623.02s)]
*  Susan Rice. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  Susan Rice set up this whole war. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  Susan Rice encouraged Zelensky to push for entering into NATO and sort of signal we might [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=628.26s)]
*  do that. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=636.22s)]
*  That, of course, ended up ticking off Putin and I think in many ways starting this invasion. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=637.22s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump has said, no, you're not going to be part of NATO in this deal. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=645.26s)]
*  We're going to leave that as a neutral area and also you're going to pay us back. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  The Europeans, you guys, are also sending messages similar to the Democrats saying, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=655.98s)]
*  we stand with you, Zelensky. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=660.34s)]
*  I think it's interesting because what I see is that the American people are not just seeing [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=662.02s)]
*  the ingratitude and sort of entitlement of Zelensky, but that actually is emblematic [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=667.3s)]
*  of the Europeans in general. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=673.9s)]
*  They don't seem to care that we have our own problems here, that we have our own debt, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=675.8199999999999s)]
*  that we have our own people to take care of. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=680.66s)]
*  We have our own border. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=682.62s)]
*  We have our own border that we're just now finally, thank God, because of Donald Trump's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=683.62s)]
*  securing. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=687.3s)]
*  For this guy to walk in here with that kind of attitude, I think is also a bad look for [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=688.3399999999999s)]
*  Europe in general, but also I think reflective of who they are. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=693.9399999999999s)]
*  To all these Democratic points, Democratic lawmaker points that this was a big setup [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=698.74s)]
*  and it's so embarrassing, White House officials insist to us it was not a setup and somebody [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  went on the Daily Mail, a White House official, to say Zelensky should not have gone after [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=708.9799999999999s)]
*  J.D. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=713.2199999999999s)]
*  The bigger point about these Democrats, they have amnesia because, yes, this extraordinary [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=714.22s)]
*  moment played out on live TV, but this extraordinary moment also happened behind closed doors two [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=719.74s)]
*  and a half years ago. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=724.98s)]
*  NBC News, Halloween 2022, Joe Biden had barely finished telling Zelensky he'd just greenlighted [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=725.98s)]
*  another $1 billion in U.S. military assistance for Ukraine when Zelensky started listing all [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=733.86s)]
*  the additional help he needed and wasn't getting. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=738.86s)]
*  Biden lost his temper, people familiar with the call said. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=741.3s)]
*  The American people were being quite generous and his administration and the U.S. military [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=744.74s)]
*  were working hard to help Ukraine, he said, raising his voice and Zelensky could show [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=749.2199999999999s)]
*  a little more gratitude. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=753.74s)]
*  If you swapped in the names Trump and Vance, that is pretty much exactly describing what [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=756.1999999999999s)]
*  we saw yesterday. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=762.02s)]
*  In politics, there's this rule, you know, never, the top people, they never really say [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=764.6999999999999s)]
*  sorry for anything. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=768.2199999999999s)]
*  You can say thank you. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=770.9s)]
*  Yeah, but what's interesting is that that was a private call. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=771.9s)]
*  We heard that readout of it, but it's a whole other thing, isn't it, Charlie? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=776.1s)]
*  Just seeing it, seeing his face, seeing his smirk, seeing him roll his eyes, seeing him [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=779.78s)]
*  refer to JD Vance, the vice president, as JD, while JD refers to him as Mr. President, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=784.14s)]
*  showing up in the Oval Office, you know, wearing his military costume. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=790.78s)]
*  And sitting there like this, you sit there like this if you're in trouble for something [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=794.28s)]
*  or if you're really worried about... [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=800.5s)]
*  The body language was something else, and the eye rolling and the huffing, the body [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  language in and of itself was pretty amazing. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=808.74s)]
*  Well, he said, as Donald Trump said, you're gambling with World War III, Donald Trump [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=811.62s)]
*  doesn't want to fund it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=815.6600000000001s)]
*  I think most of the American people are with him. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJnOeN-8Y&t=816.98s)]
