# Jim Gaffigan roasts everyone, including Kilmeade, at Al Smith Dinner
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo)
*  When the president joins us, we will start by asking him about last night's 79th annual [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=0.0s)]
*  Al Smith dinner in New York City, 6 blocks away. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  He stole the show and was the feature as Vice President Kamala Harris was not there, but [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=8.84s)]
*  Ainsley and I were. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=14.4s)]
*  You were on the dais. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=16.14s)]
*  Oh, I let that slip. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=17.14s)]
*  Yeah, you were up there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=18.14s)]
*  You were very special. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=20.14s)]
*  And Judge Janine was there, Suzanne Scott, our CEO, Jay Wallace was there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=21.14s)]
*  Bill Hemmer. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Bill Hemmer was there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Alan was on the dais and so was Maria Bartiroma. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  Lauren Green was there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=30.639999999999997s)]
*  It was a big night. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=32.0s)]
*  It was great. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=33.0s)]
*  You know, since 1960, it has been a tradition for both presidential candidates to attend [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=34.0s)]
*  the dinner and kind of politely roast each other. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=38.76s)]
*  But Vice President Kamala Harris is the first presidential candidate since 1984 to be invited [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=42.64s)]
*  and not attend. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=50.64s)]
*  It's kind of unbelievable. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=51.64s)]
*  So Harris instead held an event in the battleground state of Wisconsin. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=54.64s)]
*  Trump joked about her missing the big event, though. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=58.84s)]
*  The Catholic Church, you're helping the poor, educating children and supporting the vulnerable. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=62.64s)]
*  But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=69.56s)]
*  have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  and she would have been here, guaranteed she would have been here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=80.86s)]
*  It's a true pleasure to be with you this evening. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=84.96s)]
*  Amazing pleasure. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=87.2s)]
*  And these days it's really a pleasure anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=89.2s)]
*  Anytime I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  As I look around the dais, I see all of the usual suspects. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  For instance, Mayor Adams. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=108.64s)]
*  I'd like to poke some fun at Eric, but I'm going to be nice. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=110.36s)]
*  I just want to be nice because I know what it's like to be persecuted by the DOJ for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=113.64s)]
*  speaking out against open borders. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=118.54s)]
*  We were persecuted, Eric. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=121.84s)]
*  I was persecuted and so are you, Eric. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=123.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, Governor Walz isn't here himself, but don't worry, he'll say that he was. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=126.52s)]
*  But I have to be careful, however, to understand that this will be the first time in the history [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=132.96s)]
*  of this event where jokes will be fact-checked. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=137.84s)]
*  No polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote, as I should be, as I should be. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=142.36s)]
*  But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=150.56s)]
*  She hasn't instead of attending tonight. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  She's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  Yes, it's climate-wise. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=163.56s)]
*  Today's headlines. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=164.56s)]
*  Yeah, she actually apologized for that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=165.56s)]
*  That was a big disaster. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  The takeaway was, number one, everybody wanted to be there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=170.24s)]
*  They were pumped up for it, thought the room was fantastic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  And when you have a comedian like Jim Gaffigan, maybe the top five comedian in the country, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=176.56s)]
*  as a host, and he's a big Catholic guy, he plays a huge role in the church. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  I almost said admiral. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=185.84s)]
*  Cardinal Dolan are really tight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=187.12s)]
*  And then you have, you got the most powerful senator, happens to be a New Yorker, right [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=189.8s)]
*  there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=194.12s)]
*  And then you got the former president right there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=195.12s)]
*  And then you have about, you have three NFL owners, the commissioner. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=197.1s)]
*  And then I think it was just pretty really powerful. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=201.4s)]
*  You were there too. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=204.78s)]
*  I'm curious, what was the reception like for Donald Trump? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=205.78s)]
*  And were people upset that Kamala wasn't there? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=209.34s)]
*  People were surprised that she wasn't there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=212.12s)]
*  And when you're in a room full of Catholics, and these are Catholics that are, you know, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=214.34s)]
*  changing the world, you have so many people sitting on that dais, including Brian. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=218.14s)]
*  There's Brian. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=221.82s)]
*  Oh, well, I saw Brian on the dais. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=222.82s)]
*  So I said, Laura Trump came up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=224.1s)]
*  Brian didn't know I was going to be there because I was asked to go the day before. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  So Laura, Laura comes over to my table and we started talking. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=230.5s)]
*  I said, come with me, come with me. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=233.62s)]
*  We have to go say hi to Brian. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't know that we're here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  So there was, there were all these ropes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=237.62s)]
*  So you couldn't get to the whole people on the dais. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=239.62s)]
*  So we just stood in front of the ropes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  We said, Brian! [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=245.34s)]
*  And he looked at us and it was cute. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=246.34s)]
*  We had a good time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=248.7s)]
*  And ultimately, millions of dollars are raised for various Catholic charities, also to help [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  put a lot of kids into the schools, the Catholic schools throughout the New York City area. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=256.14s)]
*  So you know, it is a tradition. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=261.06s)]
*  And we've been talking about this over the last couple of days. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=263.34s)]
*  Kamala Harris missed a great opportunity because, you know, we saw Donald Trump. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=266.86s)]
*  He's sitting, he's standing there and there's Chuck Schumer. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=271.5s)]
*  He pats him on the back, says, you're doing a great job, stuff like that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=274.86s)]
*  This is the one night in New York City where people come together. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=277.9s)]
*  They sit next to each other. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=283.17999999999995s)]
*  They exchange pleasantries. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=284.62s)]
*  It's kind of the way politics used to be. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=287.5s)]
*  It's too bad she wasn't there because it would have showed a different side between the dynamic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=294.73999999999995s)]
*  But she didn't go. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=296.73999999999995s)]
*  Remember, they paint him as the supervillain. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  And events like this, anytime he's with people and he gets to interact with them on this [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=301.17999999999995s)]
*  level, it humanizes him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  And it was a total win for him because she didn't even show up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=307.66s)]
*  And from what I hear, the video didn't do so well that she played. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=311.66s)]
*  Oh, it bombed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=314.7s)]
*  It bombed. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=315.7s)]
*  No one said a word. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=316.7s)]
*  And you couldn't even, you couldn't believe what you were seeing because she actually [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=317.7s)]
*  tried to be funny in a skit. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=322.5s)]
*  It was not funny even when it was on SNL, in my view. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=324.66s)]
*  And Catholics hate this character because it mocks Catholic kids in school. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=327.94s)]
*  I know comedy is comedy, but why bring it back in a Catholic dinner? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=332.7s)]
*  Jim Gaffigan, he was really funny. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=336.74s)]
*  He actually said something about you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=339.78s)]
*  We're going to include that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=342.3s)]
*  You'll see it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=344.3s)]
*  But he also said when he was talking about, you know, he plays Tim Walls on SNL. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=345.3s)]
*  So he said, Donald Trump said this about him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=349.9s)]
*  Most recently, Tim has been playing, no, Jim has been playing Tim Walls on SNL. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=352.65999999999997s)]
*  And that'll be a very short gig. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  He goes, it better be. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=359.9s)]
*  He goes, it better be. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=360.9s)]
*  Here's a little of Jim Gaffigan. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=361.9s)]
*  You know, looking at this impressive dais of attendees up here, I never know how to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=366.7s)]
*  address you people. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=373.5s)]
*  Do you prefer, you know, global elite or coastal elite? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=374.7s)]
*  You know, I mean, I know we live in sensitive times and I don't want to mislabel anyone. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=380.3s)]
*  You know, you're all thinking about it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=384.9s)]
*  Let me just cut to the point and point out who's not here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=387.9s)]
*  And of course, I'm talking about the middle class. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=391.3s)]
*  That filthy group of people. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=396.7s)]
*  Right, Chuck? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=400.3s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=400.9s)]
*  If I am too critical of President, of Vice President Harris, I will, you know, I will [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=403.5s)]
*  lose friendships and, you know, and mess up my career. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=412.3s)]
*  And if I am too critical of President Trump, I will lose friendships and improve my career. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=416.3s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=422.7s)]
*  The media has begun discussing the phenomena of secret Trump voters. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=431.7s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard about this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=437.7s)]
*  People who publicly say they would never vote for Trump, but then when they go in the voting [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=438.9s)]
*  booth, they do. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=444.3s)]
*  It's a small group. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=445.5s)]
*  They're called the Biden family. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=446.5s)]
*  President Biden couldn't be here tonight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=452.7s)]
*  The DNC made sure of that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=459.3s)]
*  Ten million dollars is pretty impressive. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=475.7s)]
*  I mean, granted, it could get you a studio apartment in Manhattan, which seems, you know, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=476.3s)]
*  more expensive, especially considering you can get a mayor for two business class flights. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=482.1s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=490.5s)]
*  This entire room is filled with some of the most powerful people in New York City and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=491.5s)]
*  Brian Kilmeade. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=498.5s)]
*  Remember Brian? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=502.5s)]
*  I told you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=503.5s)]
*  Brian and I started doing standup together. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=504.5s)]
*  So, we're friends. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=507.5s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=508.5s)]
*  What did you think of that? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=512.5s)]
*  I was like, it sounds like Gutfeld. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=513.5s)]
*  I thought it was cool. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=515.5s)]
*  I saw him before and he said, oh, I'm referencing you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=517.5s)]
*  I hope it's OK. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=521.5s)]
*  I'm like, do I have a choice? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=522.5s)]
*  So, I just thought, then I thought he was kidding. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=523.5s)]
*  But I think the whole thing was he wrote the jokes. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=526.5s)]
*  A lot of them up until the last minute. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=529.5s)]
*  And I think the thing about Jim Gaffigan is he's clean. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=533.5s)]
*  So, if you look at his comedy, it doesn't matter how old you are. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=537.5s)]
*  He's just a funny guy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=540.5s)]
*  There was one growner I read in the paper that kind of alluded to an inappropriate topic [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=541.9s)]
*  we will not talk about. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=548.9s)]
*  But aside from that, it was a great show. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=549.9s)]
*  And once again, going back to my original point, it's too bad she was not there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=553.9s)]
*  It was shown a side of the dynamic that would have given people a different opinion. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=557.9s)]
*  I mean, Steve, I'm sitting at this table and I'm like, wow, I'm so impressed. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=561.9s)]
*  Martha's right there behind the president. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=566.9s)]
*  Martha's right over his shoulder. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=568.9s)]
*  They do so much for the Catholic Church. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=570.3s)]
*  Brian's up there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=572.3s)]
*  I'm so proud of you, Brian. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=573.3s)]
*  And then I see Ken Langone who started Home Depot, who's been on the curvy couch. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=574.3s)]
*  I see Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the NFL. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=579.3s)]
*  I see Cardinal Dolan, who we all adore and love. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=583.3s)]
*  Obviously, Trump and Melania. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=587.3s)]
*  Robert Kraft, exactly. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=589.3s)]
*  Woody Johnson was there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=590.3s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, even Letitia James was there. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=592.3s)]
*  You see all the mayors. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=595.3s)]
*  Bill de Blasio was the only one that was booed when he walked out. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=596.3s)]
*  Mayor Adams was there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  And you just realize, my gosh, they have contributed so much to our country. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=600.6999999999999s)]
*  It was such a missed opportunity for Kamala Harris. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think she didn't go, Lawrence? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  I just think that her team has this calculation that they're going to focus on other things. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=610.6999999999999s)]
*  And the new traditional way of campaign is, you know, it's going to these different events instead of the big ones. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=616.6999999999999s)]
*  A pretty good source told me that Hillary Clinton told her not to go, that Trump can be brutal. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=625.1s)]
*  And that was the reason. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=630.1s)]
*  I'd love to see her answer that question because she blew off a lot of capsules. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=632.1s)]
*  But we've all been to this event. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=636.1s)]
*  The whole point of it is they just roast each other. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=638.1s)]
*  It's the one time you see during the whole election season where there's levity. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=640.1s)]
*  And it's just a few weeks before the election, and that's why it's so consequential. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=644.1s)]
*  That's why we ran it live last night. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=647.1s)]
*  That is also why Donald Trump is in New York City. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=649.5s)]
*  And, you know, we don't see him much during the campaign. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=652.5s)]
*  He's going to be live here. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=656.5s)]
*  He's going to be in this studio within 45 minutes. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=658.5s)]
*  He's going to be right here, live from the curvy couch. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=660.5s)]
*  And we're going to include some of the questions that you all submitted. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=664.5s)]
*  Yesterday we did a solicitation. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=667.5s)]
*  We said, take out your phone, make a video, short question. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=669.5s)]
*  We will play a bunch of them. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=674.5s)]
*  Also, you know we've been doing these barbershop series. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=676.5s)]
*  Well, he went to a barbershop with me in the Bronx. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=678.9s)]
*  And I can't wait for you to see the reaction. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=680.9s)]
*  Did he get a haircut at the barbershop? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=682.9s)]
*  I can't report on that yet. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=685.9s)]
*  We didn't really see it. I can't wait. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=687.9s)]
*  We're going to see it a little bit in the show. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=689.9s)]
*  When he's here? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=691.9s)]
*  I'll tell you how good it is. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=692.9s)]
*  So I walked up to him on the day. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=693.9s)]
*  It just said hello. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=695.9s)]
*  And he said, I was with Lawrence in the Bronx. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=696.9s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=698.9s)]
*  He goes, did he tell you about it? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=700.9s)]
*  And I actually said, yes. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=701.9s)]
*  I saw you. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=702.9s)]
*  And he goes, when is it going to be on? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=703.9s)]
*  I can't wait to see it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=704.9s)]
*  He thinks it was great. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=705.9s)]
*  What did they say when he walked in the barbershop? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=708.3s)]
*  They were happy to see him. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=710.3s)]
*  They were. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=711.3s)]
*  They were happy to see him. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=712.3s)]
*  And it wasn't just the people in the barbershop. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=713.3s)]
*  The street. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=715.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=716.3s)]
*  Secret service blocked it off as much as they had to call for reinforcement. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=717.3s)]
*  I mean, that's never happened before. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=720.3s)]
*  What is it about the Bronx? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=722.3s)]
*  Because when he was there serving pizzas or something recently. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=723.3s)]
*  And you got Latin and Afro-Latina voters that are frustrated with the state of the country. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=726.3s)]
*  And they're giving them a shot. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=733.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=734.3s)]
*  And the Yankees. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=735.3s)]
*  To a Fox News lawyer. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=736.6999999999999s)]
*  Bill Clinton actually has his presidential office up there. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=738.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=742.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right in that neighborhood. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIp5Wo7nrqo&t=743.6999999999999s)]
