# 'EXECUTION FANTASY': Dems, media smear Trump with false claim
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg)
*  Democrats and the media are smearing Trump over his comments about Liz Cheney. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=0.0s)]
*  Aisha Hasni joins us now from Gastonia, North Carolina with more. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=5.2s)]
*  Hey Aisha. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=9.28s)]
*  Hey, good morning to you guys. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=10.28s)]
*  We're almost there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=12.64s)]
*  We have made it to the final weekend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=13.64s)]
*  A couple more sleepless nights and we'll get there to election night. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=15.08s)]
*  The former president moving on on the campaign trail heading here to North Carolina, a very [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=18.16s)]
*  critical state for him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=22.16s)]
*  He is moving on while the left and Vice President Kamala Harris try to hang on to this moment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=23.8s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=30.72s)]
*  She's a radical war hawk. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=32.56s)]
*  Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=34.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=38.64s)]
*  Let's see how she feels about it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=39.64s)]
*  You know, when the guns are trained on her face, you know, they're all war hawks when [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh gee, we'll let's send, let's send [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=45.92s)]
*  10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=51.52s)]
*  But she's a stupid person. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  And I used to have, I'd have meetings with a lot of people and she always wanted to go [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=56.68000000000001s)]
*  to war with people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=62.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  So that was a full sound bite. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  You got the context of the situation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris, though, trying to jump on this, saying that this should disqualify [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=69.92s)]
*  the former president from this race. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  He has increased his violent rhetoric, Donald Trump has, about political opponents and in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=79.44s)]
*  great detail, in great detail, suggested rifles should be trained on former representative [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=86.48s)]
*  Liz Cheney. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=93.84s)]
*  This must be disqualifying. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=96.12s)]
*  But Trump is actually doubling down and defending his comments. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  She's a war hawk. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=103.84s)]
*  She kills people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=105.88s)]
*  She wanted to, even in my administration, she was pushing, we go to war with everybody. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=107.0s)]
*  And I said, if you ever gave her a rifle and let her do the fighting, if you ever do that, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=113.28s)]
*  she wouldn't be doing too well, I will tell you right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=118.12s)]
*  But she had to face the consequences of battle. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=120.48s)]
*  She wouldn't be doing it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=123.8s)]
*  So it's easy for her to talk, but she wouldn't be doing it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=124.84s)]
*  And get this guys, at least one CNN contributor is now retracting his original criticism. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  We're talking about Jonah Goldberg and he said that he reacted in quote haste when he [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=136.4s)]
*  said that Trump was calling for a firing squad execution. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=141.52s)]
*  That's not what he was doing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=145.12s)]
*  He still doesn't like what Trump said, but he said that he let his disgust for the comments [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=146.44s)]
*  get the best of him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=150.88s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=152.56s)]
*  Alright, thank you Aisha. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=153.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=154.96s)]
*  Yeah, so that one thing none of us had in our election admin calendar was, oh, closing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=155.96s)]
*  argument for Kamala Harris will be campaigning with the Cheneys. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=161.68s)]
*  So that has been a focal point of what she's done. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=166.4s)]
*  Now obviously Donald Trump has taken notice of that and part of taking notice of that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=169.48s)]
*  is pointing out the record of the Cheneys, which is as war hawks they have gotten us [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=173.24s)]
*  into and dragged out wars that have gotten a lot of Americans killed and that haven't [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  necessarily done a whole lot for the national security of America. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=181.56s)]
*  So in the process of, I should just play it, in the process of making that argument he [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=185.16s)]
*  said, why doesn't Liz Cheney go out and fight if she loves these wars so much? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  That's the point he made. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=193.44s)]
*  It's very clear. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=194.48s)]
*  If you watch the clip, it's very clear what he was talking about, but the media has said [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=195.48s)]
*  otherwise. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=199.4s)]
*  In fact, they took to their airwaves and this is what they had to say about him suggesting, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=200.4s)]
*  if you're going to vote for wars, maybe you should pay the price of wars, maybe you should [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=205.96s)]
*  fight in wars. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=209.82s)]
*  Look what this was done when it was turned into a translation by your friends in legacy media. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=211.12s)]
*  Isn't that statement a disqualifying statement? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=220.56s)]
*  Why is he allowed to mean for president? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=223.6s)]
*  I fled communism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=225.88s)]
*  This is exactly what communists do. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  They shoot their opponents. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=229.44s)]
*  Let's just be clear. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  When you talk about nine barrels, I'm sorry for all the folks out there who want to dance [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=232.76s)]
*  on the head of a pin, that is what he is talking about, an execution fantasy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's continued embrace of rhetoric encouraging violence against American citizens, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=240.83999999999997s)]
*  the latest suggestion being that Liz Cheney should have guns, quote, trained on her face. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=246.64s)]
*  Whether Trump was making a point about warmongering or not, what is clear is that Trump has made [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=251.68s)]
*  many comments recently that have been inappropriate and even violent. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=255.24s)]
*  In true autocratic fashion, he took it even further, openly fantasizing about violent [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=258.48s)]
*  retribution against one of his political opponents. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=263.72s)]
*  This is so remarkable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=267.48s)]
*  The person who was shot at twice, you know, had assassins try to shoot him twice, once [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=269.04s)]
*  got him in the ear near his head, is the guy who is being called out for political violence. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=276.18s)]
*  What? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=283.46s)]
*  And as you said, Pete, it's so obvious what he meant. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=284.46s)]
*  And this thing with the Cheneys goes way back. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=287.62s)]
*  Remember it was Donald Trump in 2016 who said no more stupid wars. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=290.82s)]
*  And he has been calling out the Cheneys and the whole neocon warmongering crowd that's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=295.42s)]
*  on the left and the right for a long time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=300.26s)]
*  And that's what he was referring to. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=303.94s)]
*  It's obvious to anybody who saw that clip. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=305.34s)]
*  Pete, you might not have had it on your bingo card that there would be the Cheneys at the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=308.29999999999995s)]
*  center of the 2024 election, but you could have had it on your bingo card. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  There would be a completely manufactured false church story in the days before the election. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=315.34s)]
*  Got to be something. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=319.46s)]
*  Here's how it was turned into headlines. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=320.46s)]
*  Look at the Drudge Report, the shell of what used to be the Drudge Report. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=322.29999999999995s)]
*  Trump calls for Cheney's execution. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=326.62s)]
*  The New York Times. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump attacks Liz Cheney using violent war imagery. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  CNN. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=332.53999999999996s)]
*  Trump rages that Warhawk Liz Cheney should be fired upon. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=333.58s)]
*  The Washington Post. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=337.18s)]
*  Trump embraces violent rhetoric. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=338.7s)]
*  Suggests Liz Cheney should have guns trained on her face. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=340.26s)]
*  Rolling Stone. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  Trump fantasizes about putting Liz Cheney in front of a firing squad. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=344.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, I'm pretty fired up about this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  And I know that at times that we can laugh off, oh, look at how ridiculous the media [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=350.82s)]
*  is. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=355.02s)]
*  This is a complete and utter hoax. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=356.06s)]
*  It is the truth spun on its head and turned into a lie. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  President Trump has talked about this at times. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=362.1s)]
*  First of all, you at home, you should create a list. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=364.3s)]
*  I want to start a list. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=367.22s)]
*  And anybody that perpetuated this story never deserves attention, nor any credibility, nor [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=368.58s)]
*  any benefit of the doubt. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  You are a liar. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=375.38s)]
*  You are a 100% pure liar. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=376.54s)]
*  And if there are licenses, if there are government grants, if there are anything going to an [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  organization that does this, cut them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=383.98s)]
*  This is the end. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=387.38s)]
*  To me, this is it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=389.16s)]
*  You don't get to look straight into America's face and go, black is white and up is down. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=390.8s)]
*  You don't get to lie. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=395.8s)]
*  Not like this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=397.1s)]
*  Well, speaking of that, well, here is a list of all the journalists who are spreading misinformation [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=398.1s)]
*  about the Cheney comments. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=404.6s)]
*  Look at that list. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=406.76s)]
*  Pretty long. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=408.44s)]
*  Yes, you got CNN, Politico, MSNBC, The Washington Post, Reuters, even National Review, Rolling [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=409.44s)]
*  Stone. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=416.68s)]
*  I don't like the word misinformation because it gets used all the time in the wrong context. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=418.84s)]
*  I hate that word. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=421.88s)]
*  It's just a lie, Will, to your point. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=422.88s)]
*  It's not misinformation. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=423.88s)]
*  It's just straight up, we refuse to acknowledge the truth of the comments that he made, which [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=424.88s)]
*  are substantive comments about someone who for years has been peddling and pushing wars [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=429.28s)]
*  that she would never fight. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  Her class and her ilk of people would never fight. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  Dick Cheney's only shot one person and it's his hunting partner. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  It's just never been a thing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  And they just straight up want to, they just add it to the enemy's list. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  This is a laziness. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=447.16s)]
*  And Liz Cheney just soaks it in like, oh, yes, Donald Trump wants to kill me. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=449.0s)]
*  They want to be at the center of their own universe. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=454.88000000000005s)]
*  I don't think people are buying it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=456.6s)]
*  That's what's so interesting. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=458.36s)]
*  There have been so many hoaxes. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=459.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't think people are buying it anymore. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  It gets clipped and played, right? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  Clip it, 12 seconds, boom, social media, boom. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=466.42s)]
*  And I hope other people see through that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it moves many votes at this point. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=473.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think that it's very interesting that Donald Trump is going to Michigan, by the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=474.48s)]
*  way, as Cheney is running with the Democrats and that record. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=479.68s)]
*  And I think everyone knows that there's all these lies and these hoaxes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=484.24s)]
*  And I don't think people are buying it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=488.84s)]
*  I want there to be a price to be paid. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=490.24s)]
*  And I'm not satisfied with low ratings. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=491.8s)]
*  I want there to be a price to pay. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=494.32s)]
*  I want licenses pulled. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=496.0s)]
*  And I want a boatload of defamation suits filed about people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=497.56s)]
*  The standard when it comes to a public figure is reckless disregard for the truth or actual [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=501.68s)]
*  malice. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  There's no more public figure than Donald Trump. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  So in order to prove defamation, he has to suggest that list of people knew that they [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=509.16s)]
*  were wrong and they had malice in their intent. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=514.2s)]
*  Easy, easy standard to prove. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=516.96s)]
*  He'll be on at eight. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=519.8s)]
*  I want to know, are you going to file defamation suits? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=520.84s)]
*  Because there has to be a price to pay for this type of lie. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  He's definitely not afraid of filing lawsuits. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=526.44s)]
*  So that's a great question. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=528.72s)]
*  I'm fired up this morning. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=530.2s)]
*  I love it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=531.2s)]
*  Ready to go. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNGYd4oSMg&t=532.2s)]
