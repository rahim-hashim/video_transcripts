**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE)
*  Congresswoman to leap I don't talk to Fox News at a rally in your district people were chanting death to America. Do you condemn? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you condemn chance of death to America? I don't talk to people that use racist tropes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=9.48s)]
*  Why can't you just say whether or not you condemn people chanting death to me? Why are you afraid to talk to Fox News is not? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=16.4s)]
*  Not listen using racist tropes towards my community is what Fox [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  News is about I don't talk to Fox News is death to America racist [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  Is chanting death to America racist talking about your guys racist tropes, you know, you guys are you guys know exactly what you do [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=34.12s)]
*  But you guys gotta go deal with it on your own self you're not gonna use me [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=42.78s)]
*  Members of your community are chanting death to America. We would think you would have a response on that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=46.32s)]
*  Plus you said when confronted after you should have been expelled from Congress when you said from the river to the sea [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  You said it didn't mean what we thought it meant [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=56.68s)]
*  Then you have that same God that's from your community saying that it's for the annihilation of Jews [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=58.68s)]
*  So which is it Congresswoman and I just gotta ask the people of Congress you guys were so [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=63.7s)]
*  Ready to get rid of Santos, but you can't get rid of a congresswoman that has this type of stuff [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=69.88s)]
*  Expousing the same rhetoric that this guy expels there in her community. I just think it's cowardice [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=75.76s)]
*  Well this way she was first, but she's not the last [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=81.88s)]
*  She was the first one to speak out against Israel now most of the Democratic Party does and keep in mind in my view [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=83.96s)]
*  She became a congresswoman to represent Palestinian cause and that's all she really cares about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=89.8s)]
*  They didn't really want her to go visit Tel Aviv [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=94.92s)]
*  They told her to go visit go over to Gaza when she did decide to visit and she has not condemned the comments [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=97.38s)]
*  You could do in the statements [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=103.5s)]
*  You don't have to give it to Hillary Vaughn if you don't want if you if you find Fox so offensive also Governor Whitmer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  Where's Governor Whitmer coming out saying? Oh, yeah, this does not represent the people of Michigan [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=108.8s)]
*  I got some yesterday saying we don't agree with this, you know [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=112.68s)]
*  Don't worry about who about whether I vote for a Democratic Republican [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  This is not represented Michigan [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=120.58000000000001s)]
*  But in that area in Dearborn the president United States should have condemned those statements [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=122.48s)]
*  You might have the right to say it, but it doesn't mean I don't find it abhorrent in America [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  Do that president and the mayor of Dearborn said that this is unacceptable. So he has spoken out against these comments [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=132.44s)]
*  This just feels like such a scary time when you think about Americans people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=139.3s)]
*  In a state like Michigan saying death to America [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=144.94s)]
*  There was this 18 year old in Idaho that was just arrested by the FBI because he pledged allegiance to ISIS [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=148.5s)]
*  And he came up with this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=155.88s)]
*  What literally looks like an actionable terror threat that where he was going to kill people at a church in his hometown [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=158.02s)]
*  I know and it is scary to hear death to America depth that Israel Brian was talking yesterday to Carrie [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=163.8s)]
*  Kupec urban who said that essentially that that language is protected its [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=169.56s)]
*  Protected speech it is offensive. And here's the thing about to leave [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=176.18s)]
*  essentially to leave has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=180.24s)]
*  Remember when she was sworn in as all members of Congress you are sworn in to defend [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=182.24s)]
*  the United States of America [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=187.6s)]
*  If you cannot defend the United States of America, hey death to America [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=190.12s)]
*  Are you for that and she would not respond is just like come on. That's a no-brainer [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=194.28s)]
*  She could have said look, I've already pledged to defend the United States [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=199.2s)]
*  So it's it's the other guys freedom of speech, but I don't agree [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=202.92s)]
*  You can't respond because she agrees and the reason why I say that she agrees because it's her community [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  She said some of the same similar things to the river to the sea [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=212.6s)]
*  She tries to twist the words and act like she doesn't meanwhile she's on the financial service committee which has [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=215.72s)]
*  Oversight of Treasury when there is sanctions being brought on different countries. I don't think she should be on there [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=220.96s)]
*  She definitely should not be over oversight getting information from the FBI [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=226.9s)]
*  If she cannot be firm on her stances when it comes to defending and protecting this country [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=231.08s)]
*  I don't understand why she's on these committees let alone in Congress and moving beyond her [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=236.94s)]
*  I mean if you think about what President Biden is doing with his [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=242.88s)]
*  Israel policy it's I mean [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=245.88s)]
*  Clearly he is criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu now [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=248.4s)]
*  Every other day because he is trying to appeal to these very voters who are chanting death to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=251.68s)]
*  America and as we move on just a quick note [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=258.56s)]
*  I just was watching local Israeli TV essay go on YouTube and find out Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=260.56s)]
*  No one's pushing back against his policies [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=265.12s)]
*  They don't like what he's doing with certain areas [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=267.0s)]
*  But not the way he's doing the war against Amos is not upsetting the people of Israel [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=268.72s)]
*  So when you condemn him you're condemning the people of Israel and what they want and that is not to be massacred in October 7th [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=273.96s)]
*  And this is what they get the people the Palestinian people [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=281.28s)]
*  85% support Hamas Hamas is living underground using them as human shields. This is our mosque problem [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=284.76s)]
*  It's not a Netanyahu problem when we used to understand that I'm Steve Ducey [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJ61J_72rE&t=290.71999999999997s)]
