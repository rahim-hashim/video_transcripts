# Mark Cuban's pitch for Harris stuns hosts: 'This is desperate'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M)
*  The economy an issue, jobs an issue, the border an issue. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=0.0s)]
*  Last week, listen to what Kamala Harris supporter Mark Cuban, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=4.8s)]
*  the guy from Shark Tank, and a billionaire as well, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=9.44s)]
*  how he explained why so many people are in this country [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=12.52s)]
*  after having entered illegally. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=16.8s)]
*  Look, here's my opinion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=20.2s)]
*  I'm not speaking for the campaign with this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=21.76s)]
*  I thought their hearts were too big when Joe came into office, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=23.8s)]
*  that they didn't know how many people would cross the border, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=27.36s)]
*  and it got away from them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=30.24s)]
*  But they figured it out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=31.48s)]
*  They learned. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=32.56s)]
*  Big hearts. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=34.0s)]
*  Mark Cuban is somebody who's vehemently anti-Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  He is desperate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=38.72s)]
*  He can't believe that Trump is on the cusp of getting re-elected. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=41.64s)]
*  He is now trying to counter Elon Musk. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=45.36s)]
*  Obviously, that is the biggest reach I've ever [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=48.84s)]
*  heard from an intelligent person in the history of man. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=52.4s)]
*  Well, not just intelligent. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=55.44s)]
*  His heart is too big. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=56.44s)]
*  So I let murderers and criminals in. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=57.28s)]
*  Well, not just an intelligent person. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=59.28s)]
*  You live in Dallas, Texas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  OK? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=63.4s)]
*  You live in Texas, the epicenter of this crisis. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=63.92s)]
*  There's not even a Democrat in Dallas, Texas that is sympathetic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=66.52s)]
*  with the administration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=70.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=72.2s)]
*  I mean, what do you live in? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=72.96s)]
*  Who are the people that you're talking to on a day-to-day basis? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=75.44s)]
*  You know what grates me about this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=77.96s)]
*  OK, Kamala's heart is too big. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=79.32s)]
*  Well, my heart is big. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=81.12s)]
*  In 2021, when I saw a report that these migrant children, who [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=82.64s)]
*  I have a deep passion for, they were being put in facilities [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=86.6s)]
*  eating bloodied raw chicken with feathers coming out of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=90.28s)]
*  They were on suicide watch lists. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=93.56s)]
*  And one little girl prayed, I pray God hears me, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=95.6s)]
*  because no one is hearing me right now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=98.44s)]
*  If you're Kamala Harris and your heart's too big, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=100.44s)]
*  you go to that emergency and take facility. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=102.52s)]
*  You see those migrant children, who I want to help, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=104.56s)]
*  who I have a heart for. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  But she did not. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  So don't give me this crap about a heart being too big, Mark. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Let's finish this up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=112.4s)]
*  We also know that your heart's too big. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=113.64s)]
*  If I'm with the Harris campaign, hey, Mark, stop helping. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=115.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=118.84s)]
*  That does not help. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=119.64s)]
*  JD Vance saw that and said this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=120.56s)]
*  But look, we also have to deport people, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=124.2s)]
*  not just the bad people who came into our country, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=127.76s)]
*  but people who violated the law coming into this country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=130.36s)]
*  We've got to be willing to deport them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=134.04s)]
*  And I think, I think, by the way, of course, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=136.96s)]
*  you can be humane about this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=141.16s)]
*  You can be compassionate about this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=142.68s)]
*  But I completely reject the argument [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  that Kamala Harris's open border, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=147.28s)]
*  which has led to 320,000 missing children, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=149.32s)]
*  that has led to 11 and 12 year old girls [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=153.56s)]
*  being sex trafficked by Mexican drug cartels, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=157.68s)]
*  that is not compassionate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=160.4s)]
*  Having a border is compassionate for American citizens [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=161.92s)]
*  and for everybody else too. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=165.16s)]
*  It was a good argument. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=166.52s)]
*  Also, what about us? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=167.52s)]
*  Why do we, why does our heart continue [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=169.52s)]
*  to have to supersede, you know, our current circumstances [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=171.68s)]
*  where the communities are being taken over, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=175.08s)]
*  the rec centers are being taken over, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  the schools, they're passing out debit cards to people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=180.12s)]
*  And we got kids that are in our own communities [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=183.12s)]
*  that can't read and write, right, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  that are struggling on a day to day basis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=187.12s)]
*  They're not getting a debit card. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  They pay for the food. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=190.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=190.96s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  They're not getting a debit card. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  They pay for the food. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=193.76s)]
*  Use the heart and the head, how about that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oau7LNDc-M&t=194.56s)]
