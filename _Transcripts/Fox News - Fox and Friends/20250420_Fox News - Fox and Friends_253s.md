# Rev. Franklin Graham: Easter is about a ‘second chance’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ)
*  Samaritan's Purse, helping Western North Carolina [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  recover from Hurricane Helene and California residents [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=3.88s)]
*  months after wildfires devastated Los Angeles. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  President and CEO of Billy Graham Evangelistic Association [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=11.88s)]
*  and Samaritan's Purse president, Franklin Graham [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=15.72s)]
*  joins us now with his Easter message to communities in need. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=19.2s)]
*  It is so great to see you this morning and happy Easter. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=24.8s)]
*  Well, you know, a happy Easter to you and he's risen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=30.2s)]
*  You know, the grave is empty. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=33.16s)]
*  Jesus Christ is alive and guess what? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=34.8s)]
*  He's coming back for those that put their faith [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=37.12s)]
*  and trust in him and he's gonna take them [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=39.2s)]
*  to his father's house. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=40.96s)]
*  And let me tell you, that house is some kind of house. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=42.36s)]
*  They got gold streets up there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=44.64s)]
*  They got gates that are made out of solid pearl. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  It's an amazing place, but happy Easter. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=49.2s)]
*  So what is your message? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=53.04s)]
*  Obviously, it's wonderful to, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=55.16s)]
*  you painted a wonderful picture there [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=57.8s)]
*  and it's wonderful to think about all of that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=60.36s)]
*  But obviously, the message is probably a little bit different [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=61.84s)]
*  for some people in Western North Carolina [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=65.88s)]
*  and in around Los Angeles in the wake of all [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=67.96s)]
*  that they've been through and nobody has been more there [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=72.2s)]
*  for those people than you have been. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=75.4s)]
*  And so what is your message to those people? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=78.12s)]
*  Well, we've got a special that is, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=82.32s)]
*  that's gonna be on Fox tonight or today at 12 noon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=84.88s)]
*  But it's, I want the people of California [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=88.36s)]
*  here in North Carolina know that God isn't mad at them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=91.44s)]
*  So many people think when a storm comes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=93.4s)]
*  and bad things happen to them, the fires or whatever, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=95.64s)]
*  God is somehow mad at them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=98.4s)]
*  I want them to know that God loves them and cares for them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  And we have that hope, if we put our faith [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=102.72s)]
*  and trust in his son, Jesus Christ, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=106.68s)]
*  that when this life is over, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=108.84s)]
*  and it's gonna be over for all of us, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=111.16s)]
*  one day, and I'm 73, it may be over for me today, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=113.08s)]
*  you never know. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=116.44s)]
*  But I'm gonna be in my father's house [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=117.56s)]
*  because I put my faith and trust in Jesus Christ [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=120.52s)]
*  when I was 22 years old. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=122.84s)]
*  And so the people out there in California still, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=124.48s)]
*  they've got a long road in front of them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=126.8s)]
*  Same thing here in North Carolina. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=129.24s)]
*  We'll be working here in North Carolina [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=130.68s)]
*  for the next probably three to four years helping people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=132.6s)]
*  It's just gonna take that long. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=136.2s)]
*  But I'm just grateful that Samaritan's Purse, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=138.16s)]
*  we've got an opportunity to help people to do it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=140.44s)]
*  in Jesus' name. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=143.08s)]
*  And as we celebrate Easter, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Easter's about a second chance. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=146.4s)]
*  Not only has God given us a second chance, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=148.68s)]
*  but we all have a second chance [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=151.44s)]
*  by just confessing our sins and repenting, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=153.96s)]
*  asking God's forgiveness, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=156.44s)]
*  and then inviting Jesus to come into our hearts, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=158.16s)]
*  and he'll do that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=161.52s)]
*  You are always so faithfully pastoring to people [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=163.96s)]
*  that are in need, but I also know [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=167.24s)]
*  that you probably see some pretty inspiring stories [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=169.56s)]
*  out of those ashes in the places where you go to help. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=173.96s)]
*  Well, you know, we talked to people out there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=179.72s)]
*  on the streets in California, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  and they talked about the fires. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  They talked about it as like going through the flames of hell. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=186.52s)]
*  And you know, my Easter message this year [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=191.0s)]
*  is a little different. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=193.32s)]
*  It says most pastors aren't gonna speak on it, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=194.56s)]
*  but Jesus Christ came to save us from hell. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  And out there, we heard a lot of testimonies [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=201.68s)]
*  of people that came to those fires miraculously. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=203.68s)]
*  But there is a real hell. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Jesus preached on hell. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=208.36s)]
*  And so this Easter message this year [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=210.28s)]
*  is about how to escape the flames of hell. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's gonna be at 12 noon here on Fox. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=216.0s)]
*  So I hope people have a chance to tune in. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=219.72s)]
*  And then it'll be on later on in the day as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=222.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  We will definitely be tuning in. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=226.16s)]
*  Do not miss out on that message. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Franklin Graham, thank you for joining us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfZyi-sXyQ&t=233.68s)]
