# Democrats RAGE against Trump, Musk over DOGE: 'Fight it out!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c)
*  Okay, Democrats are heading to court to fight Donald Trump's cost-cutting agenda, temporarily [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=0.0s)]
*  blocking Doge from Treasury records and pausing Trump's federal employee buyout plan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=6.42s)]
*  We will fight it out in Congress. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=15.9s)]
*  We will fight it out in the courts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=18.42s)]
*  We will fight it out across this country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=21.1s)]
*  And I promise you, we will win. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=24.3s)]
*  I want to applaud the courts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=26.62s)]
*  They're doing a pretty damn good job right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=28.82s)]
*  The courts shut Elon Musk down at the Department of Justice and the FBI. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=31.78s)]
*  And the courts shut them down at USAID on Friday night. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=37.3s)]
*  And the courts shut them down at the Department of Treasury. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=42.7s)]
*  Well, we're not shutting her down, we're bringing her on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  Fox News legal editor Carrie Urbahn joins us right now from D.C. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=49.86s)]
*  Carrie, good morning to you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=53.22s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=54.22s)]
*  To quote Barack Obama, elections have consequences. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=55.5s)]
*  And this is one of those consequences. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=58.78s)]
*  If you are in charge of the executive branch, and all those agencies are, you are the sheriff [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=60.76s)]
*  in, the new sheriff in town. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=67.14s)]
*  You can do what you want. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=69.02s)]
*  So ultimately, the Democrats might want to take him to court, but who ultimately is going [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=70.58s)]
*  to win? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=77.42s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=78.42s)]
*  And Steve, this was something that I observed over and over again when I worked in the federal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=79.62s)]
*  government at DOJ. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=84.26s)]
*  Are career officials vital to the day to day functioning of the federal government? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=85.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  We need them for that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  However, it's the political appointees who are technically the elected folks who implement [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  the president's agenda because they've been appointed by the guy, as to your point, who [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  won the election. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=100.7s)]
*  And one thing I watched inside the government and I've watched the media push this misguided [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=101.94s)]
*  notion is that career folks should have the power when in fact it's the politicals because [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=106.14s)]
*  of the election and also the judgment of career officials should not supplant that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=111.9s)]
*  of the political appointees. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  But that has been a push inside the government for many, many years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  And I think why there's such a meltdown right now is because the Trump administration, I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=121.42s)]
*  say, is going about it the right way and saying, no, no, I was elected. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=126.22s)]
*  These are my appointees. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=129.82s)]
*  They're the ones responsible for driving and implementing my political agenda. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=131.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I think Donald Trump loves the fact that a lot of Democrats' hair is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  on fire because now they are forced to defend millions and millions and perhaps billions [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=140.08s)]
*  of dollars in, when you look at it, it looks like stupid programs that through time have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=147.16000000000003s)]
*  just continued or somebody figured out how to squeeze it through Congress and it's the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=153.5s)]
*  law of the land. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  And in what universe should a government not be able to, should not be allowed to conduct [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  an audit of its finances? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=163.44s)]
*  That's what we're talking about, which is why I think the Treasury Department decision [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  is especially concerning. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  The fact that a judge said that only career officials within the Treasury Department can [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=171.12s)]
*  assess their own data that has personally identifiable information, it's outrageous. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of talk about the constitutionality of Donald Trump's actions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  I would say the conversation really should start shifting to the constitutionality of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=184.6s)]
*  the judiciary, because in a situation like that, for instance, they are blocking a co-equal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=188.56s)]
*  branches function, you know, a legitimate exercise of their authority. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=194.0s)]
*  And so the fact that for some reason career officials should have more access than the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=199.06s)]
*  politicals, it's not just ridiculous. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=203.48s)]
*  I would argue that politicals should have more access than the careers in that they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=205.04s)]
*  were appointed by the person who won the election. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=209.56s)]
*  And he won on a campaign promise to clean up the government. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=211.68s)]
*  And they're trying to do that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=216.08s)]
*  And there is mass resistance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=217.36s)]
*  And Carrie, you know, ultimately, you know, for a lot of people, they said, I never heard [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=219.6s)]
*  of U.S. aid before. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=224.32s)]
*  But that was one of those things that Republicans had railed against for decades, just like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=226.6s)]
*  the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=231.6s)]
*  Republicans haven't liked that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=234.68s)]
*  NOAA, the weather people, stuff like that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=235.68s)]
*  We knew that was coming. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=238.98s)]
*  The next part is going to be harder, because it's going to be the Department of Education [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=240.6s)]
*  they're going to take a look at and the Pentagon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  And the Pentagon has got so many lobbyists who fan out, you know them, across Washington. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=247.32s)]
*  And suddenly Republicans are even going to go, you know, I'm not so sure about that cut. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  It's always about money, isn't it? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=260.2s)]
*  You know, when people start freaking out, that's typically what you can trace it to. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=261.52s)]
*  And look, Steve, I think even on the federal buyouts, you know, action that Doge drove, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=266.0s)]
*  you know, if you take a look at that, no one is being forced to resign. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=271.36s)]
*  No one's being fired. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=274.4s)]
*  And this idea that, well, Congress appropriated these funds in this way. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=276.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  That hasn't changed. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  Those positions are funded. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  And so once those positions are funded, the executive branch can decide how they want [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=282.48s)]
*  to deal with it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=286.6s)]
*  And here they're offering them a deal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=287.6s)]
*  They don't have to take it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=289.12s)]
*  And so I don't even see what the issue is there exactly, especially when you and clearly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=290.8s)]
*  a lot of those federal employees don't either considering how many thousands of them have [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  accepted that offer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=298.56s)]
*  But we'll see what happens given the judiciary's interference in that one. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=299.56s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=304.52s)]
*  Thank you very much for trying to make it so much easier for us to understand. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=305.52s)]
*  And you did a good job. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=307.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=308.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=309.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX19wVD2u7c&t=310.52s)]
