*  It's the worst border in the history of the world the people are petrified and it's getting worse and worse you look at New York [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=17.32s)]
*  Chicago Los Angeles and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=24.88s)]
*  Now you look at all over the place [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  This comes as a new report reveals illegal migrants are making up to about 75% of the arrests [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=31.24s)]
*  Right here in Midtown Manhattan where I am sitting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Former director of New York ice removals Tom Feely joins us right now with reaction Tom. Good morning to you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=42.28s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. Thanks for having me [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=48.96s)]
*  You know, we've got this kind of perfect storm going on where you've got the migrant crisis tens of thousands of migrants are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=50.64s)]
*  Here in the New York City area at the same time, you know, they had the bail reform [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=57.92s)]
*  So they know that if they're arrested, it's a revolving door. They're gonna be out in eight minutes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  Absolutely, you know [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=69.0s)]
*  It's really sad I retired in 2021 from ice just because of this reason the Biden administration [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=70.12s)]
*  Came in and was gonna order us not to enforce the law and quite frankly [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=75.92s)]
*  I just wasn't raised that way and it wasn't gonna happen with me, you know, New York City did this to themselves [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=80.12s)]
*  They could do four things right now this morning Steve that could fix this problem [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=84.52s)]
*  Get rid of the horrible green light law which prohibits law enforcement with cooperating with ice in New York State [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=88.56s)]
*  Get rid of your ridiculous ridiculous sanctuary city stuff in New York City, which isn't working anywhere in the country [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=94.44s)]
*  Take a look at this bail reform because you are absolutely right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=101.72s)]
*  If you go into these tent cities or these camps or the hotels or wherever they're housing these illegal aliens [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  They will flat-out tell you they know they're not gonna be detained long and the other thing that we really need to do [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=109.8s)]
*  You know New York City and law enforcement in New York State has to honor ice detainers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=115.08s)]
*  All we're asking for is you to hold a bad guy [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=119.6s)]
*  Right a day or so [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  So we have an opportunity to get there pick them up and interview them all these things would keep our country state safe [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=123.8s)]
*  But the governor and the mayor down in New York City absolutely want no part of us [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and and Tom I know you've you've seen her ads where she talks about, you know [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=134.0s)]

*  As president I'm gonna crack down on fentanyl [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=145.16s)]
*  Doesn't really address the issue of tens of thousands of migrants coming into the country right now [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=147.88s)]
*  Where as we've seen here in New York and you've seen it some of punch cops kick cops that Tom [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=154.0s)]
*  There should be a rule you punch a cop you're going home [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=160.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know the Biden administration has been the worst [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=163.04s)]
*  Administration as far as border security goes and like President Trump said last night [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=166.88s)]
*  You don't have to like him [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=170.68s)]
*  I've worked with every president since Papa Bush and the reality and the fact is the border was secure under President Trump [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=172.04s)]
*  That is what we need and I was actually on Fox News once [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  You know when she was first nominated or told or announced as the borders are and she you know [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=182.0s)]
*  Says that never happened and people want to say that never happened really because I was on Fox News once [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=187.68s)]
*  And talking about how she's the border czar never been to the border and how this is a complete failure [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=192.08s)]
*  So, you know, you can be fact intolerant all you want but you know [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  The government has a duty to keep us American citizens safe and they're not doing it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ixzGEOemU&t=201.20000000000002s)]
