# Wildfire smoke is California’s biggest health threat: Dr. Marc Siegel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0)
*  Smoke from the California wildfires traveling hundreds of miles and air quality dipping into ranges deemed very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=0.0s)]
*  Unhealthy for people still in LA. So what are the health concerns? Dr. Mark Siegel joins us now. Dr. Siegel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=6.98s)]
*  Thank you for joining this morning. So, um, you know, obviously, you know, everybody thinks about wearing masks and you know covering your face [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=13.84s)]
*  What are the most important things in addition to that that people can do that are around the wildfires? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=22.12s)]
*  Well, you know Charlie good morning [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=31.0s)]
*  The first thing is we have to separate out what's acute and what's long-term risk and one of the things that really is disturbing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=32.96s)]
*  About this particular fire it's is it's in the city [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=40.76s)]
*  So you're seeing a lot more toxins than you would if it was in wooded areas and you have those [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=44.32s)]
*  Particulate matter that's very very small and gets deep into your lungs [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=49.96s)]
*  So I'm particularly worried about children who have smaller lungs and I'm particularly worried about people with underlying lung [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=53.68s)]
*  Conditions and heart conditions where inflammation is caused that can provoke [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=61.6s)]
*  lung attacks [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=66.48s)]
*  asthma emphysema [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=67.88s)]
*  Heart attacks all of that starts to fill the ER and we're starting to see an uptick of asthma right now in attacks [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=69.32s)]
*  Just as importantly is the mental health aspects of suddenly being displaced from your home [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=76.36s)]
*  Not knowing if you can go back our reporters have been reporting on people trying to get back to their homes and they're told [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=82.06s)]
*  It's not safe yet [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=88.66000000000001s)]
*  It's not safe and this these fires are still burning completely out of control [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  Smoke is the number one health risk not the fire and the psychological reaction to that is huge [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  But I think that's really interesting and very important point to make because obviously that's the reality on the ground there [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=100.26s)]
*  Stress really is a has to be a huge factor in all of this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=107.5s)]
*  Because you don't know where you're gonna sleep that night because you you don't remember if you took everything that you need [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=114.66s)]
*  We don't you don't know if your home's still there [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=119.34s)]
*  You don't know if it could be there now [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=121.26s)]
*  But not be there in two days and all of these effects are long term people with pre-existing mental health issues [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  There the studies have been very dramatic on this a study out of Alberta [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=130.38s)]
*  Showed that one-third of all people in an area with a wildfire had long-term mental health issues [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=134.14s)]
*  California studies over a decade looking at millions of people have shown this again and again remember that that fire in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=139.94s)]
*  2020 burned over 4 million acres and this one here is just getting started smoke [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  Short-term health risks the particulate matter long-term health risks in terms of your lungs risks of cancer [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  Fertility issues and again worsening lung and heart problems [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  So and then obviously you see a lot of people wearing goggles because of the embers that are flying around [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=162.46s)]
*  How important is it to keep your skin covered? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=167.66s)]
*  Well, that's hugely important and I think in this instance [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=171.38s)]
*  It's a time when we should really be promoting the use of n95 masks if you're close to the area [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  You know, it was 65 degrees in LA County yesterday. I think air conditioning should be on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  I think you should be in as in stores as much as possible if you can get those air filters they work [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=185.5s)]
*  There's a run on them right now [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=191.18s)]
*  It's hard to get them but the air filters work the masks work and getting as far away from the fire [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=192.7s)]
*  Obviously and another thing most importantly Charlie. This is insidious. It spreads from miles beyond the initial area [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=198.58s)]
*  All right, dr. Siegel. Thank you for joining this morning [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=205.78s)]
*  Great to see you Charlie. I'm Steve juicy [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlHCwWB1fV0&t=210.06s)]
