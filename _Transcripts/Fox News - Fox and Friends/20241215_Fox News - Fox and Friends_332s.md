# Bartiromo calls out Big Tech CEOs for wanting a ‘seat at the table’ in Trump admin
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4)
*  Titans of the business world wasting no time rushing to curry favor with President-elect Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=0.0s)]
*  Reportedly angling for spots on whatever business advisory panels [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=6.08s)]
*  He's going to form and in the tech world meta [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=9.8s)]
*  Amazon and open I AI all pledging seven figure donations to the inaugural fund with Jeff Bezos set [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=13.24s)]
*  To meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago this week [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=20.04s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=22.72s)]
*  He's not the only Titan set to head down to Mar-a-Lago this week and to react with more on that Sunday Morning Futures anchor [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Maria Bartiromo so great to see you my friend. I've been to Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=29.48s)]
*  I'm sure you've been to Mar-a-Lago a lot of tech Titans making the journey down to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=33.72s)]
*  Palm Beach this coming week. What's behind all this and you can't be too transparent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=39.04s)]
*  I understand you don't want it to look as if you're saying this is purely transactional [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=45.68s)]
*  But I do think they're trying to curry a little favor. What say you? Oh, yeah for sure Kevin great to see you all [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=49.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. They want to be part of the conversation and that's the bottom line. I would say two words [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=55.16s)]
*  regulation and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=61.28s)]
*  Antitrust those are the two issues that have been big issues for many CEOs because the Biden-Harris administration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Has been stopping lots of deals the FTC has a problem with antitrust concerns when you see big merger [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=69.6s)]
*  so they've been getting in the way of lots of deals and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=77.28s)]
*  preventing many of these companies from getting larger and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=80.96s)]
*  Merging so that's the antitrust part of it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=84.32s)]
*  and then there's the regulation part of it many of these companies have been just [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=86.52s)]
*  Dominated by dealing with new rules and regulations under the Biden-Harris administration [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=90.88s)]
*  They know President Trump is going to do the opposite of that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=95.32s)]
*  He's going to deregulate in other words take away some of these burdens and rules around the climate change agenda [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=97.92s)]
*  Like one easy one which the Securities and Exchange Commission put in place a couple of years ago, which [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=104.16s)]
*  made it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=110.72s)]
*  unlawful to not have a plan for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=112.2s)]
*  Emissions impact from your customers and their customers [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=116.76s)]
*  And so all of these rules around the Biden climate change agenda will go away [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=119.84s)]
*  Likely on day one with President Trump's executive orders and these CEOs want a voice at the table [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  They see what has happened to Elon Musk by the way by partnering with Trump on so many things and they say oh look [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=129.68s)]
*  At this he's got the president's ear. They want the president's ear as well when talking about regulation [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=136.32s)]
*  So that's one of the issues I think yeah [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=142.2s)]
*  I think crypto is also gonna is a big one on the table, isn't it? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=144.28s)]
*  Yeah for sure and that's why people are very happy about Paul Atkins as the incoming Securities and Exchange Commission [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  Head because he will take over for Gary Gensler. This is Trump's pick [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Paul Atkins has been saying for a long time that all of the regulation around crypto has forced [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  Developers to go to Europe and Asia and and and do real big business and it's leaving the US [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=165.44s)]
*  Alone and in not having that kind of expertise. So Paul Atkins coming into the Securities and Exchange Commission [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=172.2s)]
*  It's gonna do a lot for crypto legislation people need clarity that all of these different agencies running things [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=178.38s)]
*  You know, they want oversight over crypto. You've got the Securities and Exchange Commission the CFTC [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=184.98s)]
*  That's where also Doge comes in because Doge [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=188.88s)]
*  Is looking to cut costs and one idea is to merge the CFTC [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=192.04s)]
*  Which is the commodities futures and trading Commission with the SEC Securities and Exchange Commission? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=197.06s)]
*  We'll probably see mergers like that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=201.7s)]
*  So people want to know if Paul Atkins is gonna get behind that idea [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=203.17999999999998s)]
*  And so yes [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely crypto is one of the issues and then they see these CEOs see people like David Sacks getting a White House role [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=207.1s)]
*  Running crypto and AI again, they want a voice at the at the table. So we're talking about that this morning for sure [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=213.54s)]
*  We are leading off the program with Utah Senator Mike Lee and we're gonna talk about the change in the regulatory framework to come [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=219.54s)]
*  We're also talking about the president's budget and and his first 100 days [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=226.54s)]
*  What will that first 100 days look like? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=230.84s)]
*  We're told that the priority is going to be the border will be the border and then energy in in the first [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=233.48s)]
*  Reconciliation package, you know, you wouldn't think that they need a reconciliation package [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Which means you only need a majority vote in the Senate for the border knowing the way America just voted [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=244.44s)]
*  But guess what they don't have the votes for the border bill [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=250.0s)]
*  So they have to take it to the reconciliation package meaning the extension of the tax cuts gonna come much later in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=254.0s)]
*  2025 something that the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Jason Smith is not in favor [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=260.8s)]
*  I'm so I'm gonna talk about that the agenda as well as how how likely it is that President Trump gets his [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  Nominees for his cabinet through and then we're talking with Devin Nunes this morning big story here as Christopher Wray [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=270.88s)]
*  Announced his resignation this week and cash Patel perhaps coming in to run the FBI [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=277.68s)]
*  Devin Nunes knows all about the political dirty tricks that that were played on him as well as cash Patel [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=283.28s)]
*  And of course President Trump with the Russia collusion lie yesterday [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=289.96s)]
*  I'm not sure if you guys saw it, but President Trump announced a new role for Devin Nunes [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=293.64s)]
*  He's gonna continue running Trump Media and Technology Group, but he's taking on a new role of chairman [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=297.56s)]
*  chairman of the intelligence [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=304.2s)]
*  the intelligence architecture [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  As an outside chairman, so we'll see this is gonna be outside people away from the federal government [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  So that'll that'll be interesting to talk with Devin Nunes about this morning as well. We'll be watching Maria [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=314.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thanks guys. I'm Steve juicy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tSMPsd0pF4&t=319.28s)]
