# Kamala Harris has been an ‘agent of change’ in making America’s worse: Donald Trump, Jr.
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs)
*  Joining me now in this Sunday Morning Future's exclusive is Trump Organization executive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=0.0s)]
*  vice president and the son of the 45th president, Donald Trump Jr. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Don, good to have you this morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=7.44s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=9.68s)]
*  I'd like to start there because you've gotten information from the FBI that Iran not just [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  wants to take down President Trump, but his family as well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=17.12s)]
*  There is a direct threat on you and your brother. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Is this correct? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=24.6s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=27.1s)]
*  If they inflict the kind of damage to someone's family, they get the effective disturbance [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=28.98s)]
*  to the campaign, to my father, to that mentality without perhaps eliciting the response from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=34.34s)]
*  the U.S. government. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=39.300000000000004s)]
*  I've been told that not only by the FBI, but also by members of Congress who are read into [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=40.300000000000004s)]
*  these kinds of things. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  They can't obviously give me certain details, but they're like, you guys better take it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  really seriously. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=50.3s)]
*  So this is kind of getting old. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=51.3s)]
*  I've had a lot of time in the last few months where I'm going to have to explain to my young [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=53.7s)]
*  children why radicalized Democrats are trying to kill their grandfather. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=56.78s)]
*  Now you've had to do that twice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=61.7s)]
*  Then you have this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  And then you have the hacking where Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terror, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=64.58s)]
*  is literally colluding with the Biden-Harris administration to try to give them information [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=69.34s)]
*  against their political enemies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=75.7s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I can't tell if it's terrible or if it's perhaps the greatest endorsement of my [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  father's campaign. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  Iran does not want him to be president. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  Russia does not want him to be president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=86.66000000000001s)]
*  Our enemies do not want my father to be president because they understand that bringing back [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=88.54s)]
*  strength and resolve to America is really bad for their global ambitions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=93.22000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I can't think of a better endorsement, Mary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  Well, let me switch gears to the upcoming vice presidential debate this Tuesday night. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  Don, it has been said that you were among those encouraging your father to choose J.D. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  Vance as his running mate. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=109.66000000000001s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=110.98s)]
*  Now he goes head to head against Tim Walz on Tuesday night. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=111.98s)]
*  What are you expecting? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=114.78s)]
*  Listen, J.D. has been incredible. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=116.38s)]
*  Every time I watch him, whether it's the Sunday morning shows, you know, just dismantling [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=119.74s)]
*  the left on their home turf, I just feel totally vindicated in all of that decision. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=124.02s)]
*  He's been absolutely outstanding. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=128.54s)]
*  J.D. is a guy of substance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=130.54s)]
*  He's a guy that's lived that American dream, coming out of Appalachia to become now the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=132.18s)]
*  vice presidential candidate for the Republican Party in the United States. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=137.66s)]
*  But beyond that, building businesses and everything along the way. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=142.7s)]
*  I think he's been incredible. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=145.58s)]
*  You know, Tim Walz is the exact opposite of that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=146.58s)]
*  He's someone that lied about his military career. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=149.22s)]
*  He lies about each and everything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=151.3s)]
*  He makes every mistake in the book. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=153.58s)]
*  His greatest accomplishment seems to be he's the guy that was able to put tampons in boys' [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=154.9s)]
*  bathrooms in schools and the guy that let the main city of the state that he's supposedly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  the governor of burn to the ground without any confidence. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=165.34s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't really pick a more, you know, a greater dichotomy of individuals. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=170.18s)]
*  I think it's going to be a lot of fun to watch. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=175.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, what do you think comes out of this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=177.66s)]
*  President Trump is leading on all the important issues like the economy, like immigration, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=181.66s)]
*  although these polls are very tight. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=186.66s)]
*  Are you surprised by how tight these polls are? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=188.34s)]
*  You know, I'm not surprised because I'm used to seeing this, whether it's the games in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=193.02s)]
*  the polls. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't really look at polls, Maria. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  Most of them are designed to artificially boost someone's ego. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=197.98s)]
*  The other half are designed to demoralize you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=201.14s)]
*  Most of it's nonsense. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=204.22s)]
*  The only poll that matters is on November 5th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=205.22s)]
*  So I encourage everyone out there to start voting, to start voting early. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=206.82s)]
*  None of that really matters. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=210.7s)]
*  But we also have to understand we're not in a fair fight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=211.82s)]
*  We see the entire weight and force of the mainstream media against us. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=213.98s)]
*  You don't see the media complaining about Kamala Harris literally letting in 16,000 [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  rapists across the border that she was in charge of. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=223.14s)]
*  16,000 murderers as part of the millions of people they've let into this country unchecked. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  They know that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  They understand they put out these statistics. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  Six hundred thousand criminals. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=235.17999999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  Sure, come in. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't really matter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  They're able to print those statistics. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=240.45999999999998s)]
*  So that means they knew and they allowed them in anyway. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, so if you have a media that refuses to call that out, if you have a trillion dollar [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=244.61999999999998s)]
*  big tech apparatus that continues to function as the marketing department for the other [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  side, you know, it doesn't surprise me that it's close. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=254.66s)]
*  You know, close. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  I think the American people get it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  I think they understand. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=260.02s)]
*  You know, they go to the grocery stores and they feel that pain. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=261.02s)]
*  Kamala Harris caused that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=265.14s)]
*  She's not the agent of change that the media is telling us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=266.62s)]
*  She's changed everything for the worse. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=269.74s)]
*  She's been in charge for three and a half years. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  She copied the Joe Biden, Kamala Harris failed policies and put them on her website. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  They didn't even delete the source code. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=280.1s)]
*  Nothing is going to change. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  These failed policies of America weakness, America last are going to continue. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=283.54s)]
*  And I think the American people will finally understand that if they start paying attention [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=288.66s)]
*  and don't just believe what they're force fed through the media. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=292.3s)]
*  And yet you've got social media doing its best to sort of change the narrative. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=295.62s)]
*  You know, President Trump has vowed to to prosecute Google, for example, at maximum [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=301.1s)]
*  levels for election interference. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=307.18s)]
*  Give us your sense of whether or not we've seen a change in the unfairness on social [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=309.82s)]
*  media against President Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think you've seen it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=316.26s)]
*  Obviously, you have truth social. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=318.82s)]
*  Now you have, you know, what's going on at Twitter or X. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=319.94s)]
*  That's become a little bit more of a fair playing field. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=324.05999999999995s)]
*  But most of the other platforms are still a total disaster. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=326.14s)]
*  Then you get into search engines, you know, such as Google, you know, just manipulating [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  the data that's seen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=332.58s)]
*  If you do a search on anything, Trump, it's all negative. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=333.58s)]
*  Sort of like a statistics you saw from ABC News where 100 percent of the Kamala Harris [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  coverage in the last three months has been 100 percent favorable and everything on Trump [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=340.22s)]
*  was 93 percent negative. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=344.38000000000005s)]
*  That's exactly how search engines work. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  People go online, they're looking for the story in the first 40 articles they see on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=347.98s)]
*  a given subject as the CNN version of the truth, not what actually happens, but through [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=351.14000000000004s)]
*  their lens. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  You can actually find the truth if you actually have the time to scroll to page eight thousand [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=356.94000000000005s)]

*  But most people don't. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=361.94000000000005s)]
*  So what's going on in big tech, what's going on in search engine space, what's going on [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=362.98s)]
*  with Google, the way they're manipulating what people are seeing, the information they're [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=366.98s)]
*  able to garner. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=371.26s)]
*  You know, the truth is out there somewhere on the Internet. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=372.26s)]
*  You'll just likely never find it if you don't have infinite amount of time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=374.5s)]
*  Well, look, Don, at the end of the day, people just want a fair election in November. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=378.06s)]
*  I want to get your insight perspective. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=383.70000000000005s)]
*  the GOP and the RNC has done enough to protect a fair elections coming up now five weeks [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=387.34s)]
*  away. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=394.94s)]
*  I'm talking about the swing states, Nevada, Pennsylvania and the enhanced election integrity [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=395.94s)]
*  moves we've seen. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=401.29999999999995s)]
*  Are you comfortable with this? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=402.85999999999996s)]
*  Do you feel that enough has been done? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  Listen, I think they're doing everything they can. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=405.94s)]
*  The problem is, you know, these things are all left with the states. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=408.62s)]
*  If you have a leftist slash Democrat state legislator, there's only so many things you're [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=411.02s)]
*  going to do. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=415.82s)]
*  I mean, even in Alabama this week, I guess the DOJ is suing because they don't want to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=416.82s)]
*  remove 4000 people that they know are actually noncitizens that are on the voter rolls. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=421.94s)]
*  I mean, that's the Democrat Party doing this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=427.02s)]
*  They don't want to take people who are known noncitizens, people who are legally not allowed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=429.3s)]
*  to vote. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=434.78s)]
*  They want to make sure that we can't take them off the roster. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=435.78s)]
*  That kind of stuff happens every day. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=438.34s)]
*  That's happening everywhere. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=440.34s)]
*  The amount of lawfare that they're able to put into this, the millions and millions that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=441.42s)]
*  are funded to it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=445.54s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's not just fundraising and campaigns where they can dwarf us because [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=446.54s)]
*  Soros or whoever it may be. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  They do that in each and every instance. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=452.62s)]
*  So I think we've done an incredible job doing what we can. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=454.42s)]
*  But we're up against a lot of forces that are not looking to do the right thing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  They're looking to try to literally give illegal aliens the right to vote. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  They're looking to let them get away with it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=466.36s)]
*  Well, it's not really a crime. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=468.18s)]
*  If you didn't know, so wink, wink, wink, show up and vote. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=470.0s)]
*  They're doing this across the board. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=473.86s)]
*  The amount of calls I've had from people, Ken Paxton in Texas, hey, they're giving them [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=475.14s)]
*  I.D. cards and then they're registering to vote, even though they know they're not actually [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=479.3s)]
*  legal to vote. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=482.41999999999996s)]
*  And they're just hoping that no one has the time to catch it all. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=483.41999999999996s)]
*  So they're playing whatever games they can imagine. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=486.06s)]
*  They're flaunting it before the American people. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=489.06s)]
*  It's absolutely disgusting. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  But we should be accustomed to that now from the Democrat Party, because they are not the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=492.94s)]
*  party of putting Americans first. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=496.82s)]
*  They've ostracized so many of their normal demographics that would have been reliable [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=498.78s)]
*  Democrat voters. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=503.3s)]
*  So rather than actually do what's good for those people and the rest of the American [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  people, they said, you know what, we're just going to replace you by bringing in 20 million [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=508.34000000000003s)]
*  unknown, unfettered, some of whom are murders and rapists, many of whom, frankly, at this [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  point. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=516.58s)]
*  And that's how they're going to handle the situation. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=517.58s)]
*  It's honestly, it's laughable if it wasn't happening in America right now. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=519.54s)]
*  It's truly disgusting. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=523.22s)]
*  And Don, thank you very much for weighing in this morning. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=524.22s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=526.74s)]
*  Trump Organization Executive Vice President Donald Trump Jr. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=527.74s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfdipO-V4Xs&t=530.34s)]
