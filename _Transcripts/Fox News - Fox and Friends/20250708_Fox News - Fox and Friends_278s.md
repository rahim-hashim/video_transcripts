# New details revealed after July 4th attack on ICE facillity
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88)
*  You know, meanwhile, we've been talking this morning and as someone who covered the border, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=0.0s)]
*  it's just outrageous that the threat environment against Border Patrol officials, ICE agents, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=3.68s)]
*  has never been higher. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=9.84s)]
*  We had, of course, the attack just before 6 a.m. down in McAllen, Texas on the Border [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Patrol annex. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=16.38s)]
*  You can see this is actually from another one. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  This is the Border Patrol annex in McAllen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=20.44s)]
*  I've been there many times. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=22.56s)]
*  The special operations division, this individual charged it with a rifle and was killed in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=24.96s)]
*  the process. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=31.92s)]
*  And, of course, this comes after we just saw the shooting outside an ICE facility in Prairie [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=32.92s)]
*  Land, Texas, which 10 individuals have now been charged with first degree attempted murder [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=39.68s)]
*  of a federal agent because they fired off 20 to 30 automatic rifle rounds at officers, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  ICE officers, striking one in the neck. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=51.08s)]
*  Especially who will be okay. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=53.12s)]
*  In McAllen, by the way, a McAllen police officer who helped respond to the incident was shot [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=54.44s)]
*  in the leg. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=59.92s)]
*  He'll be okay. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=60.92s)]
*  But it's all part of why you're hearing from White House First Secretary Caroline Leavitt [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=61.92s)]
*  that, you know, we're going to get to the bottom of these instances and it's time for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=67.28s)]
*  the rhetoric to tone down. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=71.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=73.44s)]
*  We certainly call on Democrats to tone down their rhetoric against ICE and Border Patrol [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=74.44s)]
*  agents who, again, are everyday men and women. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=81.52s)]
*  I would encourage AOC and other Democrats to actually meet with the United States Border [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=83.8s)]
*  Patrol. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=88.66s)]
*  These are honorable Americans who are just simply trying to do their job to enforce the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=89.66s)]
*  law. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  They go home to their families every night, just like we all do, and they deserve respect [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  and dignity for trying to enforce our nation's immigration laws and to remove public safety [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=97.96s)]
*  threats from our communities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=103.3s)]
*  The White House is aware of the shooting that took place today in Texas, and we are working [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  with the appropriate federal agencies to get to the bottom of what happened. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=110.34s)]
*  Charlie and Emily, we're learning more and we will continue to learn more about the incident [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=113.78s)]
*  that happened in Alvarado, Texas. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=118.66s)]
*  The Northern District of Texas is putting out at least these details now, saying the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  defendants dressed in black military-style clothing began shooting fireworks at the facility [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=124.76s)]
*  as part of an organized attack when the Alvarado police officer arrived. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=130.1s)]
*  One alleged defendant positioned in nearby woods shot the officer in the neck area. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=134.34s)]
*  Another alleged assailant across the street fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed correctional [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=139.8s)]
*  officers who had stepped outside the facility. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Additionally, officers found spray paint, flyers stating, fight ICE terror with class [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  warfare and free all political prisoners, and a flag stating, resist fascism, fight [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  oligarchy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  It underscores the organized effort behind this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=161.52s)]
*  And so to Caroline Levitt's point, we're going to find out who's at the bottom of this, and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  that's a little bit of a contrast from that single person that ambushed there and McAllen, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=167.92s)]
*  who loved Call of Duty and as the former director Chris Clem said, well, there's no reset button [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=172.32s)]
*  in real life, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  There's one in your video game. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  But the reality is that somehow there is funding, there is organization, and there is leadership [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=179.6s)]
*  behind these attacks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's behind the reason or part of the reason why now ambush attacks have risen almost [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=186.16s)]
*  800%. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  It is patently unacceptable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  But I have faith in this administration. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  Not only will they identify those sources and the origins, but they will also put a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=194.88s)]
*  stop to it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=199.24s)]
*  Well, you know, a lot of these, a lot of this unrest is perpetrated by people who are just [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=200.24s)]
*  out to protest absolutely anything. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=204.72s)]
*  They don't care what it is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=207.24s)]
*  If they can cause mayhem, they will. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=208.24s)]
*  And I think there's a huge funding apparatus that pays for a lot of that stuff. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=209.98s)]
*  But of course, this is a whole lot more targeted. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=214.72s)]
*  This is very specific, targeted at ICE officers. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=218.26s)]
*  And of course, it all mirrors a lot of what we hear from actual elected political officials [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=222.94s)]
*  in the Democrat Party. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  And so they do bear responsibility for toning down the rhetoric and standing up to this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=230.62s)]
*  faction within their party. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=236.78s)]
*  This is a real part of their party. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  And we had an election. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=240.42s)]
*  The electorate spoke very clearly that they want our immigration laws enforced. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=242.82s)]
*  They want to have a border. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=249.22s)]
*  And the problem for Democrats is that even Democrat voters want that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  And so at some point, Democrat officials, Democrat politicians need to stand up to this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=257.58s)]
*  faction and put an end to this nonsense. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=263.94s)]
*  The American people spoke clearly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FfdqCRnf88&t=266.1s)]
