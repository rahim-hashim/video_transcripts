# Lara Trump: This is FAR worse than what's being reported
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg)
*  Tomorrow, former President Trump is rallying voters in Butler, Pennsylvania, for the first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=0.0s)]
*  time since the July 13th assassination attempt. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=7.76s)]
*  And Lara Trump joins us now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=10.76s)]
*  Good morning to you, Lara. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=12.36s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=13.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=14.92s)]
*  Why was it important for him to do this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=15.92s)]
*  Well, listen, Ainsley, I don't think any American will forget where you were on July 13th, 2024, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=17.32s)]
*  at 6.11 p.m. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=24.6s)]
*  That's a moment we will all remember. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=26.28s)]
*  Obviously, this was important for Donald Trump to go back to Butler, Pennsylvania, not just [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  for the people there in Butler, which, of course, he's got this bond with forever, I [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=34.6s)]
*  believe, but really for the country as a whole. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  We need a moment of healing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  And he wants to create new positive memories and associations with Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's what you're going to see tomorrow. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=49.92s)]
*  In life, I feel like you can operate out of a place of fear and cowardice, or you can [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  operate out of a place of strength and faith. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=57.56s)]
*  And that is who Donald Trump is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=60.88s)]
*  I knew before he even announced he wanted to go back to Butler that this would be something [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=62.28s)]
*  that he would want to do, because he is trying to show leadership right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=66.56s)]
*  And this is a man, Ainsley, I know that you know this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=70.92s)]
*  I don't have to even tell the audience this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  This is a man who is not afraid of anything. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=75.0s)]
*  He doesn't back away from a challenge. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  And what you're going to see in Butler, Pennsylvania tomorrow is the kind of strength and leadership [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=79.28s)]
*  we are desperate for back in that White House. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=84.0s)]
*  And I think this is going to be an emotional rally tomorrow. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=87.12s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to being there with Eric. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=90.84s)]
*  And I think it's going to be really, really incredible. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=92.84s)]
*  That's great. I know Elon Musk has announced that he's going to be there and they're going [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=95.48s)]
*  to honor the memory of Corey Compenter and the two others that were injured, which I [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=98.72s)]
*  thought was beautiful. So, Laura, you're from North Carolina. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  We're talking to our friends there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  We're talking we're interviewing so many people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=107.44s)]
*  It's just it's it's so sad. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=109.4s)]
*  All these houses are gone. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=111.52s)]
*  Lives have been taken away from from families. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=113.12s)]
*  And the former president is going to go there, North Carolina and Georgia today, Donald [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=116.64s)]
*  Trump. What do you make of this disaster relief help? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=121.24s)]
*  They're saying they feel forgotten. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  I got to tell you, Ainsley, you're right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  This is my home state. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't even have the words to describe what I have been hearing from people who live in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=129.84s)]
*  the western part of the state. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=134.68s)]
*  I have to tell you, I think what we're going to find out is far worse than anything that's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=135.76s)]
*  been reported. I'm hearing from people that the the local authorities are no longer trying [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=139.84s)]
*  to go house to house to just bring water to people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=144.72s)]
*  They're going house to house to bring body bags, that there's an overwhelming smell of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=147.12s)]
*  corpses rotting right now in the western part of the state. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=151.68s)]
*  People have been left behind and disgraceful does not begin to describe what we have seen [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=155.44s)]
*  in the western part of North Carolina. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=162.56s)]
*  I am hopeful that our authorities across the board are paying attention to this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=164.76s)]
*  Our federal response has been abysmal and it is absolutely disgraceful that in the United [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=169.32s)]
*  States of America we have Americans dying not because of a natural disaster, but because [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=174.16s)]
*  of a manmade disaster of relief efforts. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=178.56s)]
*  There is a lack of that there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=181.6s)]
*  And as a former North Carolinian myself in a place I call home, I cannot tell you how [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=183.24s)]
*  upset I personally am to see what's going on there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=188.88s)]
*  I'm so sorry, Laura. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=192.24s)]
*  I've been fighting something about corona the last few days. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=194.32s)]
*  I know. And I'm so sorry about those people in North Carolina. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=197.0s)]
*  God bless you. I'm going to get some tea. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=200.12s)]
*  We'll be back in a minute. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=201.96s)]
*  Steve is having breakfast with friends. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lsLJrO09Qg&t=202.8s)]
