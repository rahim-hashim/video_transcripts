# ‘We’re a new party now’: GOP rep details a ‘populist’ push within ‘all Americans’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg)
*  Well, let's bring in a man, GOP congressman, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=0.0s)]
*  Jim Jordan, who joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=4.18s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for being here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=5.68s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump is real. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=8.98s)]
*  He's not fake at all. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=10.44s)]
*  I love the way Rachel said he's as real and genuine [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=11.48s)]
*  as it comes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=13.68s)]
*  And they're the party that, you know, the borders are. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=15.08s)]
*  It can't secure the border. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=17.48s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act, that can actually cause [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=19.42s)]
*  and play, they're the party that's always faking it [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=21.66s)]
*  and winging it, not President Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=23.56s)]
*  He's as genuine as they come. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=25.42s)]
*  And that's why I think, then you're in your first part, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=26.7s)]
*  that's why I think you're seeing his support increase [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=28.66s)]
*  with Hispanic Americans, African Americans, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=31.36s)]
*  maybe most importantly, all Americans, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=34.0s)]
*  you're seeing his support increase because they know [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=36.1s)]
*  what we had when he was president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=38.7s)]
*  We have, frankly, we have something we very seldom [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=41.7s)]
*  get in American politics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=43.6s)]
*  Back-to-back administration is now running for the top job [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=44.74s)]
*  and you get a direct comparison. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=47.18s)]
*  We haven't had this in not know how long. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  So this is, and people are starting to look at four years [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=50.24s)]
*  of Trump versus what we've had with three and a half years [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=52.58s)]
*  of Biden-Harris and they see the real difference. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=54.92s)]
*  Well, Congressman, we're seeing a shift in strategy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=57.72s)]
*  from Democrats who were effectively running [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=60.22s)]
*  a bubble-wrapped campaign, not doing much media. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=62.26s)]
*  And now Tim Walz is on Fox News Sunday, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=64.38s)]
*  again this weekend, they're doing press all over the place, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=66.08s)]
*  although most of the time it's still very carefully curated, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=69.16s)]
*  but they feel like they need to get out front. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=71.92s)]
*  Why the change for them? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=73.86s)]
*  Because they're losing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=75.94s)]
*  You can see even the polls are starting to just ever so [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=77.44s)]
*  slightly tick in President Trump's direction [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  in all the swing states and the states that they're focused [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=81.74s)]
*  on, you know, the so-called blue wall, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=84.44s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=85.58s)]
*  President Trump just keeps inching up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=87.76s)]
*  And as we've seen in the past two cycles, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=89.1s)]
*  those polls typically underestimate where President Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=92.0s)]
*  is in his support. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=95.08s)]
*  And again, I think this is so clear. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=96.14s)]
*  Under President Trump, we had a secure border. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=97.94s)]
*  Under Biden-Harris, no border. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=99.82s)]
*  Under President Trump, we had $2 gas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=101.32s)]
*  Under Biden-Harris, $4 gas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=103.34s)]
*  Under President Trump, we had safe streets. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=105.18s)]
*  Under Biden-Harris, we've had record crime. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=106.92s)]
*  And under President Trump, we had stable pricing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=109.78s)]
*  Under Harris, we've had record inflation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=111.86s)]
*  And I haven't even got into full policy, for goodness sake. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=114.58s)]
*  So the American people are smart. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=117.62s)]
*  They can see the difference. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=119.66s)]
*  And again, I think that's why you see all Americans moving [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=120.78s)]
*  in President Trump's direction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=123.22s)]
*  And by the way, we're a new party now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  We're now a populist party rooted in conservative principle. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=127.86s)]
*  And President Trump has made that dynamic happen. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=132.26s)]
*  And that is a good thing for our party. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=135.7s)]
*  I think it's a good thing for the country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=137.24s)]
*  And that's why you're seeing new voters, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=139.1s)]
*  working class people, middle-class people being attracted [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=141.18s)]
*  to President Trump and his leadership. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, Congressman, I want to ask you about this story. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=146.06s)]
*  We covered it a week ago. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a pretty concerning story about an Afghan refugee [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=149.06s)]
*  who was arrested as part of a plot [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=152.4s)]
*  to unveil an ISIS-like attack, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=154.4s)]
*  perhaps in D.C., perhaps on Election Day. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=156.84s)]
*  He's been arrested. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Now we have information that he previously worked with the CIA. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=160.84s)]
*  And because we worried about this, Congressman, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=164.88s)]
*  like when thousands of people were brought out of Afghanistan, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  were they all properly screened, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=171.22s)]
*  what could their connections have been? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  Because, of course, we want to help those [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  that helped us in Afghanistan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=175.86s)]
*  Are we making sure we're only bringing friendly people to America? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=177.36s)]
*  What the latest news is, he was screened three times [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=181.9s)]
*  before entering the United States? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is just sort of the natural thing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=187.24s)]
*  that I think is going to happen [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=190.02s)]
*  when you look back at that debacle [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=192.32s)]
*  that was the exit from Afghanistan. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=193.88s)]
*  I think we can all remember, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=195.62s)]
*  I think it's sort of a metaphor for the Biden-Harris regime, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=197.16s)]
*  which is that picture, that plane getting ready to take off [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=200.02s)]
*  and people actually trying to jump on the wheels of that plane. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=203.02s)]
*  When you have that many people come in, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=205.74s)]
*  I think things like this are potentially going to happen. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=208.06s)]
*  And then you couple it with the larger problem, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=210.3s)]
*  over 10 million migrants entering the country [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=213.06s)]
*  in three and a half years, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=215.06s)]
*  99 on the terrorist watch lists that we know about [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  who were actually released into the country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  Not to mention the fact that they've lost track [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=220.68s)]
*  of all kinds, thousands and thousands of children, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=222.34s)]
*  not to mention all the criminals [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=224.56s)]
*  who've done terrible things. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  But this thing with Afghanistan, so many came in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=228.3s)]
*  and you just know they weren't getting properly screened. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=230.74s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=233.66s)]
*  And of course you have something like this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  where this guy was planning to do something terrible [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=235.38s)]
*  on election day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=238.78s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=239.94s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, Congressman Jim Jordan, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  thanks for joining us on Fox and Friends with Ken. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=244.78s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_E_MNTrTQg&t=246.02s)]
