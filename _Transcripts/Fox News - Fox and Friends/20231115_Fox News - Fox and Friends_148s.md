# IDF targets Gaza hospital used by Hamas as terror headquarters
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY)
*  We begin in southern Israel where there have been numerous headlines from overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey, let's start there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Bill. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=8.6s)]
*  A lot of updates overnight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=9.6s)]
*  We'll start with Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital, where Israeli forces conducted an early morning [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  raid targeting what they say are tunnel entrances for Hamas, the group in control of Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I want to give you the play-by-play of how all of this unfolded and how we found out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=23.92s)]
*  Last night, I received a text message from a senior Hamas official inside Gaza, and he [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  said in a few minutes the hospital will be stormed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=33.44s)]
*  We then reached out to the Israeli military. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=36.54s)]
*  They didn't initially have any information, but then ultimately released a statement saying [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=38.32s)]
*  they are indeed storming Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility, to go after [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Hamas militants. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=47.92s)]
*  We've gathered more information this morning from top intelligence and defense officials [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=49.28s)]
*  here in Israel trying to get an understanding of what the focus and efforts were for the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=53.2s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  In some of this video here, one of the main objectives for the Israeli forces in Al-Shifa [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  was to deliver medical aid to Palestinian civilians. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=63.04s)]
*  We understand there are around 600 patients at Al-Shifa Hospital, also around 1,200 internally [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=66.0s)]
*  displaced Palestinians who are sheltering in place there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=71.36s)]
*  The Israelis delivered aid to those Palestinians, and they also went after Hamas militants. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=74.92s)]
*  They say they killed four militants around the hospital gates before entering the facility, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=79.58s)]
*  but once inside, no bullets were fired. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  This is of note because it indicates Hamas fighters and leadership used the tunnel network [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=88.22s)]
*  to get to the southern part of Gaza, knowing that the Israelis were going to raid the facility. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=93.22s)]
*  Now, all of this is taking place amid ground fighting inside Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=97.34s)]
*  The Israelis say they took over the Al-Shati camp in the northern part of Gaza, largely [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=100.98s)]
*  considered to be a Hamas stronghold. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=104.78s)]
*  And then when we go to the south of Gaza, with the Rafah crossing the border between Gaza [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=107.18s)]
*  and Egypt, today for the first time since the conflict began, a fuel truck passed into [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=111.66s)]
*  Gaza coordinated with the United Nations, but an indication there are conversations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=116.7s)]
*  taking place behind the scenes, not only to try to diplomatically get some of those hostages [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=121.02s)]
*  freed but also get more aid into Gaza. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=125.06s)]
*  Bill? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=127.58s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  In about 20 minutes, we'll talk to a member of the IDF and we'll go to the map and show [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  our viewers at home what is beneath that hospital in Gaza City. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=132.76s)]
*  Thank you, Trey, for that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=136.62s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFhYPzxmpIY&t=137.62s)]
