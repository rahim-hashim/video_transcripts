# Alina Habba: Is there anybody more savage than Trump?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I)
*  And here to react is counselor to President Trump, Alina Habba. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to have you with us, counselor. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=3.64s)]
*  My sister, if I could personalize this, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  a fairly outstanding junior amateur athlete. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=7.76s)]
*  And so this is a topic that is near and dear to me [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=10.44s)]
*  and I think to millions of Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=13.32s)]
*  When the president responded to the governor saying, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=15.08s)]
*  yeah, we'll see you in court, what'd you think of that? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=18.76s)]
*  I mean, I was his lawyer, as we know. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=24.28s)]
*  So it was really, I mean, is there anybody [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=26.68s)]
*  who is more savage, can we just say it like it is? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=29.8s)]
*  He's just so, he knocked her right down. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=32.2s)]
*  I mean, she was trying to rebel [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=35.2s)]
*  and she didn't know what she was talking about. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=36.96s)]
*  And he goes, she goes, we will comply with the law. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=38.6s)]
*  I made the law, I told you what it is. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=42.16s)]
*  And this is the mandate. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=44.4s)]
*  And more importantly, it's really not President Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=45.36s)]
*  It's what America wanted and voted for. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=48.2s)]
*  So when you see this, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=51.16s)]
*  honestly, this exchange is exactly why he won. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=53.64s)]
*  This is exactly why he won. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=56.36s)]
*  It could not have been summarized better. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=58.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely like 10% of the people agree with her [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=60.6s)]
*  and 90% with Donald Trump on just the sensibility of this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=65.48s)]
*  and just defending our girls. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=69.4s)]
*  People are just sick of this small minority [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=71.36s)]
*  bullying their way into women's sports. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=74.6s)]
*  Here was her response, Alina. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=77.16s)]
*  She went on to give a statement that said, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=79.36s)]
*  in America, the president is neither a king nor a dictator [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=82.44s)]
*  as much as this one tries to act like it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=86.28s)]
*  And it is the rule of law that prevents him from being so. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=89.44s)]
*  But do not be misled. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=92.44s)]
*  This is not just about who can compete on the athletic field. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=93.6s)]
*  This is about whether a president [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  can force compliance with his will. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=97.84s)]
*  Without regard for the rule of law [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=100.12s)]
*  that governs our nation, I believe he cannot. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=101.68s)]
*  Your response to that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=105.88s)]
*  Right, so maybe we should watch [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=109.92s)]
*  Stephen Miller's civics lesson again, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=111.64s)]
*  where he educated everybody on the fact [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=114.12s)]
*  that 77 million people voted for this person. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=116.76s)]
*  He is king in no way. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=120.6s)]
*  He is president in every way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=122.96s)]
*  So they keep using words. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=125.24s)]
*  It's like unbelievable. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=126.92s)]
*  What does she want? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=128.8s)]
*  Does she want a 17 presidents that are tenured forever [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=129.8s)]
*  and can't leave? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=135.24s)]
*  Does she want the Nancy Pelosi's Chuck Schumers? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=136.36s)]
*  Yeah, she does. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=138.72s)]
*  In her ideal world, they would all sit behind [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=139.56s)]
*  the resolute desk and they would then say, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=141.88s)]
*  we don't have one king, we have democracy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=144.16s)]
*  No, that's not it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  President Trump represents 77 million people. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=147.36s)]
*  Every state in this country said, we want Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=151.88s)]
*  And then he went out and did exactly what we said at rallies, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=155.76s)]
*  exactly what we campaigned on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=159.16s)]
*  And the panic is real. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=160.96s)]
*  It's real and it's quite honestly, quite enjoyable to watch. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=163.04s)]
*  I mean, we're winning, we're winning in court, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=165.8s)]
*  there are attacks on Elon, it's all desperation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=168.28s)]
*  and it's going nowhere. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=170.56s)]
*  I love Alina that you mentioned that civics lesson [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=172.6s)]
*  by Stephen Miller. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=173.92s)]
*  I went right to that as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=174.8s)]
*  And it's funny, the governor says in her statement, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  she's talking about compliance when it's pretty clear [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=178.48s)]
*  what she wants to participate in is what I call [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  malfeasent compliance, malicious compliance, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=183.28s)]
*  but it's not clear she has legal standing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=186.64s)]
*  even to make this lawsuit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=189.68s)]
*  We'll see where that goes before we run out of time though. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=191.44s)]
*  I do want to get to attorney general Pam Bondi [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=193.64s)]
*  is now vowing to release [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=196.76s)]
*  the bombshell Jeffrey Epstein documents. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=198.16s)]
*  She says it's sitting on her desk. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=200.92s)]
*  Here's a little bit of what she had to say, listen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=203.55999999999997s)]
*  This is something Donald Trump has talked about, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  the DOJ may be releasing the list [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=211.48s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=213.6s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=218.16s)]
*  I'm reviewing that, I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=220.6s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=224.64s)]
*  because that was done at the directive of the president [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=226.6s)]
*  from all of these agencies. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=228.64s)]
*  So have you seen anything there, you said, oh my gosh. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=230.12s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=234.08s)]
*  Elena, do you have any insight on what's coming? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=235.6s)]
*  Transparency, transparency is coming. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=240.28s)]
*  You know, we had a lot of defiance, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=243.96s)]
*  I think is the word you were looking for [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  from the radical left. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=247.4s)]
*  And that's because they would have rather us kept quiet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  They didn't want to expose the funding [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=251.16s)]
*  that they were getting through NGOs, through USAID. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  And now they're going to panic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=256.72s)]
*  because they don't want anybody to know [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=258.16s)]
*  who was on Epstein's Island, who was a pedo [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=260.16s)]
*  and who is probably still sitting in DC. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  And the reality of the situation is this, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=266.36s)]
*  there will be accountability and America deserves it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=268.64000000000004s)]
*  We needed to know what the drones are. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=271.16s)]
*  We needed to know that we were okay. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=272.6s)]
*  We need to know about Epstein's Island. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  We wanna know about JFK. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=275.72s)]
*  The days of American government hiding [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=277.44000000000005s)]
*  from American people are over. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=280.68s)]
*  We need transparency, we have done that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=282.68s)]
*  and we will continue to do so. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm excited for Pam and now Cash to get in there [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=286.44s)]
*  and clean up our mess. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=289.68s)]
*  Well, Alina, you talked about- [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=291.28s)]
*  What's behind January 6th too. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=292.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=293.48s)]
*  We wanna see what's behind January 6th as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=294.56s)]
*  You talked about panic before. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=296.56s)]
*  When she said she had the file on her desk. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=298.72s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people in panic now, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=301.76s)]
*  but I think you're absolutely right, Alina. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=303.8s)]
*  This is how you restore trust in government [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=305.32s)]
*  with transparency and with these secrets [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=309.2s)]
*  that don't need to be secrets. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=312.32s)]
*  The American people need to know. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=313.98s)]
*  So great to have you on as always. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  Thanks, guys. You got it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXxFaOLeD7I&t=320.64s)]
