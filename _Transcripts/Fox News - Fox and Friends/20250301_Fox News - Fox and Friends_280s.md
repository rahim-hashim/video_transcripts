*  So I'm looking at this the cost of eggs is expected to go up [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=26.3s)]
*  40% this year, I know that you met with you had like a round [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=29.76s)]
*  table with like 2 dozen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=34.74s)]
*  Farmers and what did you guys gather and what are what are [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=36.980000000000004s)]

*  address the avian flu and the and the prices of eggs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=44.14s)]
*  You know Rachel I think it's first it should be said that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=48.18000000000001s)]
*  watching what happened in the White House yesterday and with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=51.92s)]
*  the president you know America is back and the strength of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  leadership, but that's really across the board how are we [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=57.84s)]
*  going to solve all of these massive problems and challenges [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=61.12s)]
*  that were brought to us by the Biden administration and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=64.78s)]
*  certainly in my lane not not with Ukraine and not foreign [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=68.02s)]
*  policy but with domestic policy and certainly with that prices [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=71.92s)]
*  that our consumers are facing that single mom in Detroit, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  you know she may I know what's going on and she may be glad [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=78.8s)]
*  that we have you know peace through strength across the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=82.5s)]
*  world, but she is much more concerned. Yeah, it's been to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=84.38s)]
*  exit gotten right now she's going to feed her family and I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=87.82s)]
*  know you're a mom of a bunch of kids. I'm a mom of a lot of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=91.0s)]
*  kids to not as many as you so this is this is a real deal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=93.5s)]
*  listen under the Biden administration egg prices [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=97.14s)]
*  increased 237%. The cost of groceries, the cost of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=100.14s)]
*  everything went up 2530% but eggs specifically and there [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=105.28s)]
*  were a lot of reasons for that one of the drivers is the avian [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  bird flu which has required almost a 160 million birds have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=113.16s)]
*  been depopulated which is a real fancy term for basically [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=117.84s)]
*  killed so that we could try to stop the flu most of that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  happened under the Biden administration. So what do we do [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=124.72s)]
*  to to fix it so we've repurposed funds from USDA to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=127.32s)]
*  push back on that part of that money is going to be used for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=131.78s)]
*  biosecurity measures which is locking the barns down the avian [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=134.3s)]
*  flu is spread through wild birds. So how do we make sure [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=138.32s)]
*  that all these barns can protect against the wild bird flu. The [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=141.56s)]
*  second thing is how do we quickly repopulate under Biden [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=145.22s)]
*  and Obama a lot of rules and regulations were put on these [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=148.5s)]
*  chicken farmers and it just takes a lot longer than it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=152.5s)]
*  should to get hands back into the hen house in lane eggs [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=155.16s)]
*  again. Third what can we do again on that deregulation [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=158.34s)]
*  piece regarding repopulation but also just regarding egg [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=162.14s)]
*  farming in general and chicken farmers in general that's a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=165.98s)]
*  massive piece of this and we're rolling back a lot of those [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=168.72s)]
*  rules. Fourth is are there short-term import eggs that we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  can do. We're already talking to even now to deal with Turkey [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=174.5s)]
*  other countries around the world to get eggs in immediately [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  and onto the shelves and then fifth which is longer term but [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=180.94s)]
*  perhaps the most important is how do we address the bird flu. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=183.78s)]
*  It is highly pathogenic it moves through the air and and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=188.22s)]
*  it's really really affecting our farmers so we've got a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=193.08s)]
*  pretty big massive plan we rolled out this week at the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=195.72s)]
*  White House and I look forward to to implementing that but [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=198.5s)]
*  listen there is no short-term fix. Tomorrow, I wish I wish I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=201.6s)]
*  could you know snap my fingers and go to the grocery store [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=205.14s)]
*  Rachel and your eggs are back down to $2 a dozen from $5 or [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  $8 or in California $12 but we are on it and we're working [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  night and day to solve it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  Well I have chickens in my backyard Sean started that and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=217.27999999999997s)]
*  yesterday I went out they just started laying and yesterday I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=220.92s)]
*  got 5 eggs. I guess my question if you can make it just really [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=224.22s)]
*  really quick some out of time is part of the solution more [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=227.54s)]
*  small farms because when avian flu hits and you have these [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=230.68s)]
*  giant industrial farms and these chickens which I don't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=234.04s)]
*  think the eggs are as good anyway is part of it just [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=237.72s)]
*  investing in smaller farms encouraging that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=240.02s)]
*  I think the silver lining and all of this is how do we in our [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=243.72s)]
*  backyards we've got chickens to our backyard how do we solve [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  for something like this and and people are sort of looking [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=249.52s)]
*  around think wow well maybe I could get a check yeah my [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=251.9s)]
*  backyard and it's awesome I agree. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=254.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think everyone who isn't a farmer right now wants [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=257.26s)]
*  to be so you're in the right department. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=259.7s)]
*  Thanks for joining us today. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=265.74s)]
*  Good morning. Thank you take care. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUdNUagsoo&t=268.12s)]
