# Ainsley Earhardt: This was an incredible revelation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ)
*  FBI Director Cas Patel is promising the American people will get more answers on the assassination [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  attempt against then candidate Trump at Butler, Pennsylvania last summer. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=5.88s)]
*  Gosh, takes you back, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=11.64s)]
*  Alex Hoff is live at the White House with more on Cas Patel's push for transparency. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Alex. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=17.88s)]
*  Hey, good to be with you this morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=18.88s)]
*  The fact remains that many Americans feel like they simply do not know that much about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=20.88s)]
*  the Butler shooter, Thomas Crooks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=25.04s)]
*  And Director Patel, he says that he seeks to remedy that with full transparency, but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=27.0s)]
*  acknowledged to Brett last night that there may not be much more to know. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=31.92s)]
*  They're going to know everything we know. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  And that's the other thing we did. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=39.04s)]
*  We take assassination attempts, especially the president of the United States, extremely [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=40.36s)]
*  seriously. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=44.24s)]
*  And we don't feel that the American people have been given the information they need [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=45.24s)]
*  on that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=48.06s)]
*  And we're digging through the files and we're getting them a more robust picture of what [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=49.06s)]
*  happened and whether or not there were any connections. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  Now, Director Patel dismissed theories that have circulated online like campaign sabotage [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=56.08s)]
*  or foreign interference, saying in those realms, people are looking for things that where they [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=61.0s)]
*  don't exist. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=65.32s)]
*  Now, a serious concern is the impression that former FBI Director James Comey's notorious [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=66.32s)]
*  8647 post has left. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=70.68s)]
*  Director Patel is furious about that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=73.24s)]
*  Comey said he didn't know it could be seen as a threat to the president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=75.28s)]
*  But now the department has to make sure that imitation posts are not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you know how many copycats we've had to investigate as a result of that beachside [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=82.72s)]
*  venture from the former director? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=87.76s)]
*  Do you know how many agents I've had to take offline from chasing down child sex predators, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=89.58s)]
*  fentanyl traffickers, terrorists, because everywhere across this country, people are [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=94.48s)]
*  popping up on social media and think that a threat to the life of the president of the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=99.08s)]
*  United States is a joke? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=103.2s)]
*  Potential legal action against Comey is still uncertain. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=104.8s)]
*  I'll send it back to you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=108.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=110.52s)]
*  That's incredible news. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=111.6s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  So he's pulling people that are tracking down terrorists and drug traffickers and child [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  sex predators, taking them off those cases so they can go investigate shells on the beach [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=121.28s)]
*  because they're these copycats after James Comey, who was fired by President Trump in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=125.88s)]
*  May of 2017. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=129.8s)]
*  He sees those shells. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  He posts that on social media, thinks it's funny, thinks it's innocent, he said. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=133.16s)]
*  He was the former FBI director and he thinks that he didn't think that was a threat. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=137.88s)]
*  Well, there's also bipartisan condemnation of James Comey. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=142.84s)]
*  Democrats don't like him and Republicans definitely don't like him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=147.64s)]
*  And it's this universal opinion that he's a dirty cop. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=151.04s)]
*  And he does things that are politically motivated. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=154.16s)]
*  And the explanation that he gave about the shells just don't pass the smell test. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=156.24s)]
*  He was talking to his wife and they were on the stroll and it's like, oh, we'll just take [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=161.04s)]
*  a picture of this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=164.04s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=165.04s)]
*  I'm trying to sell this book. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=166.32s)]
*  The one thing who, you know, the one person who loves James Comey, James Comey. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=167.32s)]
*  This guy is so in love with himself, he can't get enough of himself. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=171.16s)]
*  And he says, Cash Patel, he goes, I almost feel bad for him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=174.3s)]
*  He says he's got the job. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=177.88s)]
*  He was going chasing it down for so long. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=179.36s)]
*  He does not know how to run this organization. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=181.08s)]
*  He has no idea how to run this organization. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=183.18s)]
*  And then Cash Patel laughed at that prospect. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=185.24s)]
*  He's moving the organization. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=187.86s)]
*  He's changing their focus. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=189.08s)]
*  He's moving them out of D.C. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=190.08s)]
*  He's putting them into the bureaus. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=191.88s)]
*  And he was struck by how many people came up to him saying that he wants, they want [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=193.48s)]
*  to reform it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  He was a critic of the FBI during Russiagate. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  And then Donald Trump appoints him to be the FBI director, Cash Patel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=200.72s)]
*  And he said, I think one of the things that surprised me the most and pleasantly so was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=204.54s)]
*  the amount of men and women at the FBI that hated that they did this to the bureau. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=208.6s)]
*  And that when I got in the seat, when Dan Bongini got in the seat, they said, we want [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  to fix this place. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=218.64s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD6T5gvWnFQ&t=221.95999999999998s)]
