# Ex-Harris staffer makes SHOCKING suggestion after 2024 loss
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA)
*  All right, thanks Janice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, this morning, one of the Vice President Harris's [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  former staffers raising eyebrows with this shocking suggestion. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=3.92s)]
*  He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=10.8s)]
*  make Kamala Harris the president of the United States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=13.32s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=15.44s)]
*  He would absolve her. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=15.94s)]
*  OK, great idea. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=17.88s)]
*  Fox and Friends weekend co-host Pete Hickson [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  joins us right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=21.56s)]
*  You're giggling because this is funny. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=22.6s)]
*  Brought to you by the Party of Democracy [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=27.720000000000002s)]
*  that wants everything to happen at the ballot box, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  except everything they've tried to do [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  has happened somewhere else. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=34.32s)]
*  They try to defeat their opponent through lawfare [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=35.88s)]
*  and in courtrooms, through FBI raids of his home. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  And they installed Kamala Harris without a single vote cast [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=43.0s)]
*  amongst Democrat voters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  And now why would it surprise us that the plan is, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=46.92s)]
*  you know what, transitional Joe, why don't you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=49.96s)]
*  transition over to Kamala for 30 days [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  so we can crack that glass ceiling for 30 days, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=54.6s)]
*  feel good about ourselves, and then move on? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=57.12s)]
*  The country sent a resounding signal in the other direction. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=59.72s)]
*  Joe Biden is walking around battling the sand. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=63.12s)]
*  He'll be gone shortly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=65.36s)]
*  She is playing connect for and drinking white wine [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  with her nieces. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=70.56s)]
*  That's great. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=71.72s)]
*  That's her future. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump's headed to the White House [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=74.24s)]
*  because the adults are in charge. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=75.96s)]
*  And suggestions like this are silly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=77.72s)]
*  They're cathartic for them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=79.32s)]
*  But they lost. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=80.72s)]
*  And let them talk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=81.52s)]
*  Well, by the way, you're right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=83.12s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why they want these. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=84.32s)]
*  Pundits are suggesting it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=87.0s)]
*  They said it would make it easier for, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=88.52s)]
*  if you broke the glass ceiling now, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=90.8s)]
*  it would make it easier for a future female president. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=92.52s)]
*  The other is, in that article, and there was an op-ed about it [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=94.64s)]
*  and there was also some commentary on TV, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  the other reason is they said, not only should you [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=100.72s)]
*  put Kamala in, but then make Liz Cheney the vice president. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=103.48s)]
*  And this would really stick it to Donald Trump [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  when he has to get up there in January for the transition [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=110.28s)]
*  in power and have to face those two. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=113.56s)]
*  This is the way they think, Pete. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=116.92s)]
*  Well, that's perfect. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=118.28s)]
*  That way we can start at least three wars before January 20th. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's perfect. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=123.96s)]
*  Liz Cheney would love to do that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=125.56s)]
*  And the world will be in complete chaos. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=127.24s)]
*  It's staggering how little they have learned at all. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=129.16s)]
*  The American people rejected that unholy alliance [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=133.72s)]
*  between Liz Cheney and neocons and Kamala Harris [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=136.72s)]
*  and rampant incompetence. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  She was a horrible, horrible candidate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=143.48s)]
*  The country spoke and they're ready for Donald Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=145.76s)]
*  Well, those op-eds and those comments [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=148.2s)]
*  actually prove what we've been seeing all around, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=149.92s)]
*  which is they're not handling this well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=152.76s)]
*  They need hugs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, live from Nashville tonight, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=156.56s)]
*  you are doing a special at John Rich's Bar, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=160.32s)]
*  Redneck Riviera, right there on Broadway. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=162.6s)]
*  Modern Warriors, because it's Veterans Day, Peter. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Modern Warriors live. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  I hope folks will join us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=170.88s)]
*  It's gonna be a special night [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=172.04s)]
*  at the Redneck Riviera in Nashville. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  It's not just me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=175.16s)]
*  I'm joined by Medal of Honor recipient, David Bellavia, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=176.0s)]
*  Space Force Commander Matt Lohmeyer. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=178.8s)]
*  Remember he blew the whistle on the Marxist DEI [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  inside the military. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=183.36s)]
*  Matt Best of Black Rifle Coffrey, former Army Ranger, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=184.36s)]
*  and Jason Beardsley, former Green Beret. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=187.4s)]
*  Guys, there's been a war on Warriors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=190.12s)]
*  I wrote the book about it under Obama and Biden. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=191.56s)]
*  The war for the Warriors starts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=194.6s)]
*  And tonight we start that conversation on Fox Nation, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  7 p.m. Eastern. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=199.52s)]
*  What does a new commander in chief look like? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=200.88s)]
*  Obviously we know it's Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=203.4s)]
*  What's he gonna do? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=204.52s)]
*  How do you pull out the PC social justice nonsense [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=205.36s)]
*  and get back to meritocracy and lethality? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=208.36s)]
*  And of course, we'll remember all those we've served with [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=211.36s)]
*  on this Veterans Day as well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=213.72s)]
*  So you wrote the blueprint of what can happen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=214.56s)]
*  to end that war on Warriors. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=216.56s)]
*  And so it'll be interesting to see [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=218.84s)]
*  what the other veterans say and if they agree [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  and how much more they can add to it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  What a great conversation, Pete. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=224.24s)]
*  Looking forward to it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=225.52s)]
*  It's gonna be at a bar. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=226.36s)]
*  Thanks guys, we'll see you on Fox Nation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  Are you allowed to drink on a streaming service? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=228.56s)]
*  Steve, it's not like cable. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=231.56s)]
*  We can have a beer or two. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=233.72s)]
*  So join us at home. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=235.32s)]
*  If Kamala can have her wine, Pete can have his beer. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=236.56s)]
*  There you go, all right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=239.6s)]
*  Have a great night. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=240.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fFdAKrgHA&t=241.76s)]
