# No Republican candidate has ever been able to do this, expert says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s)
*  Catholic voters helping president-elect Trump secure his victory after Vice President Harris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=0.0s)]
*  repeatedly snubbed them on the campaign trail with moments like this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=5.04s)]
*  With the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=9.6s)]
*  he intended. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=17.44s)]
*  Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=18.44s)]
*  Here to discuss the lessons learned from this election is president of Catholic vote Brian [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=27.32s)]
*  Birch. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=32.36s)]
*  Brian, so great to have you on this morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=33.36s)]
*  As you know, Catholics went for Donald Trump by 10 points. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=35.4s)]
*  So why don't you just lay out what are your takeaways from this campaign, both what Trump [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=39.56s)]
*  did right, what Kamala Harris did wrong? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, I think it was a combination of factors, Rachel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  I think number one, Kamala Harris had a problem with Catholics and had a record of hostility [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  toward Catholics that she only made worse. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=56.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, I think President Trump spoke to the concerns of many workers and families [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=59.68s)]
*  that just want to return to normal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=65.16s)]
*  They don't want radical abortion. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=67.32s)]
*  They don't want Catholic hospitals being shut down. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=69.36s)]
*  And they want normal gas prices and normal grocery prices, a normal border and normal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=72.4s)]
*  girl sports where boys aren't hanging out in their locker rooms. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=77.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=81.36s)]
*  Biden, actually, I mean, look, the difference between Kamala Harris's politics or policies [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=82.36s)]
*  and Joe Biden is really not that different. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=88.32s)]
*  And his abortion record is almost as radical as Kamala's was going to be. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=92.16s)]
*  But the point is that Joe Biden was culturally Catholic. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=96.72s)]
*  And I think that's why he was able to I think he tied with Joe with Trump in 2020 with Catholic [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=100.28s)]
*  voters. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=106.32s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=107.32s)]
*  It was it was a couple of points. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=108.32s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=109.48s)]
*  I think the numbers you just showed, I think are actually even smaller than the real margins. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, we show that President Trump won Pennsylvania among Catholics by 16, Michigan by 20 to 25, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Florida by as high as 29 points. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  And more importantly, and I know this is important to you, Rachel, Hispanics overall by seven [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=124.36s)]
*  points. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=128.56s)]
*  Yeah, no Republican candidate has been able to do this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=129.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's absolutely fascinating. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=132.32s)]
*  The left has often tried to use immigration as a cudgel against Catholics to say, well, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=134.0s)]
*  if you oppose, you know, if or if you're not for a secure border or if you're not for open [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=139.56s)]
*  borders, I should say, then you must not be compassionate and you're not being a Christian. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=145.8s)]
*  You're not being a good Catholic. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=150.48s)]
*  It didn't work this time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=151.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=153.24s)]
*  Well, I think people it wasn't just a question of, you know, accusations about racism or [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=154.24s)]
*  about being anti-immigrant. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=159.68s)]
*  It was a questions about a normal, lawful, humane process that America can welcome immigrants [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=161.52s)]
*  into this country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=167.0s)]
*  And it turns out that's what Hispanic voters wanted as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=168.16s)]
*  President Trump was right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=171.12s)]
*  He is not the thing, the man they accused him of. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=172.72s)]
*  He's the one that can help restore order to this process where America is a welcoming [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=176.28s)]
*  country. We just want to do so in a way that is that is humane and is consistent with our [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=181.12s)]
*  laws. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=187.16s)]
*  Yeah, the other thing that the Trump campaign did that that Kamala Harris did not do was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=188.16s)]
*  they in putting aside the big policy stuff, he made gestures. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=192.52s)]
*  I mean, he would post things like the prayer of St. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=196.96s)]
*  Michael. He had the Ave Maria, you know, played at his rally. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=199.6s)]
*  There were other gestures that he kept making sort of a tip to the hat to the Catholic voters. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=203.52s)]
*  I think he went to a shrine for a Catholic priest and a Polish priest in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  How much did those little gestures mean in the in the long run at the end of the day? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think they made a difference because Catholics did have concerns about Harris's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  record with Catholics, and she only doubled down on them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=226.28s)]
*  She snubbed the Al Smith dinner. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=230.08s)]
*  She told Catholics that there would be no accommodate accommodations for us when it [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=232.16s)]
*  came to her abortion policies. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=236.64s)]
*  And President Trump did the opposite. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=238.24s)]
*  He posted about our feast days. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=240.08s)]
*  He mentioned us in our rallies and he chose a Catholic vice president and J.D. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Vance that turned out to be a superb choice that I think many Catholics rewarded him for. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=245.8s)]
*  Yeah. Was that a big deal, you think, in the end, J.D. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=250.6s)]
*  Vance? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=253.88s)]
*  Without question. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=254.64s)]
*  I mean, I think many Catholics that I know looked at J.D. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  They know he recently converted to the faith. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=258.32s)]
*  He is one of the best, most articulate spokesperson of our kind of solidarity idea in our [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=260.64s)]
*  church that we have to care for each other. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=266.84s)]
*  And I think he has a big, big future ahead of him as well. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=269.0s)]
*  Yeah, some of our best Catholics are congregate. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=273.32s)]
*  So that that goes as well. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  So great to have you on, Brian. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=278.36s)]
*  Such a great breakdown of what happened in this election with Catholics and so much to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=279.64s)]
*  learn moving forward. Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=283.72s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=286.56s)]
*  You got it. Well. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=287.8s)]
*  All right. Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHRtB1Y0Y2s&t=289.0s)]
