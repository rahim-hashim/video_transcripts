# ‘Something catastrophic happened': Top Gun graduate analyzes deadly jet crash
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=0.0s)]
*  Cars are smashed and debris is covering the ground in northeast Philadelphia after a medical [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=2.0s)]
*  plane carrying six people crashed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Air traffic control audio captured the chilling moments after the plane went down. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=9.84s)]
*  Approach to runway 24, what's going on down there? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=14.44s)]
*  It's at 7.55. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=18.68s)]
*  We have a lost aircraft. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=20.72s)]
*  We're not exactly sure what happened, so we're trying to figure it out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=23.12s)]
*  For now, the field is going to be closed, so no inbounds or outbounds probably. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=25.48s)]
*  Here to discuss is Top Gun Navy graduate Matthew Wiz Buckley. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=31.96s)]
*  Matthew, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=35.8s)]
*  You hear that audio. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=37.52s)]
*  When it first came out, it was reported this was the moments before. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=38.52s)]
*  Now we understand it makes more sense. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=42.32s)]
*  It's the moments after. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=43.72s)]
*  Walk us through what you hear there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, obviously tower realized they lost the aircraft. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=47.72s)]
*  There's previous auto of the control tower clearing them to contact Philadelphia departure [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=51.6s)]
*  and they don't. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=57.2s)]
*  So any either the captain or the first officer of the medevac flight acknowledged that frequency [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  chain so sounded like everything was fine in the cockpit up until a couple, you know, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=65.8s)]
*  maybe 3040 seconds after that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=71.36s)]
*  Yeah, we're being told that this entire scenario took place in less than a minute, which is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  hard to believe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=77.88s)]
*  But this is something I want to ask you about because of your experience with very fast [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=79.32s)]
*  jets. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=83.24s)]
*  We look at the video and to the naked eye to the average person, it looks like a missile [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=84.24s)]
*  coming to the ground at full speed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=88.72s)]
*  I know it's a lot to put in perspective, but when you see those videos and you see them [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  all together, what do you see? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=94.96s)]
*  Do you see a plane that could be at full throttle? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Are there mechanical failures that you're reminded of? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  We showed a graphic at the beginning of the show that shows the steep angle in which it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=103.52s)]
*  was going up and now it's going down. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=106.52s)]
*  Give us any insight you have there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=108.9s)]
*  And I know we're speculating. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=110.06s)]
*  Absolutely, we're speculating. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=111.7s)]
*  But in nearly four decades of flying and flying fighters, that that jet was simply not flying. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=114.12s)]
*  That was that was a missile. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=120.56s)]
*  That was a rocket. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=122.0s)]
*  Clearly something catastrophic happened either with the airframe or the engines to cause [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=130.02s)]
*  The last radar hits that I believe I saw where it was going down at close to 11000 feet per [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=131.02s)]
*  minute and close to about 280 knots. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=136.7s)]
*  So clearly something catastrophic. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  And looking at the videos, it's on fire. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=141.66s)]
*  There are there are flames leaving the aircraft that tells me there's something catastrophic. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=144.5s)]
*  Let me share with you something I was thinking about is as an F-18 Hornet pilot and as a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  civilian pilot, we own our own fighter jet for the No Fallen Heroes Foundation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=154.14s)]
*  Before I take off, before I took off in the Hornet or my personal jet, you go to full [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=159.14s)]
*  power at the hold short or on the runway. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=163.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  Because the engines are at the most power at takeoff. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  So if anything is going to happen with a motor, it's going to happen in the first couple seconds [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  of flight. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=178.06s)]
*  Business jets, airliners, they don't go to the hold short and run the motors up to full [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=179.06s)]
*  power. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  They don't get on the runway and run the motors up to full power. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  So something to think about there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=186.98s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=189.26s)]
*  I've seen that happen. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=190.26s)]
*  So the NTSB investigators, they're preparing to examine the newly recovered black box from [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=192.38s)]
*  the Blackhawk helicopter involved in the D.C. crash just a few days ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=197.5s)]
*  President Trump says the military helicopters, he thinks, were flying too high. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=202.46s)]
*  I want to play a clip real quick of newly minted Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=205.62s)]
*  The black box from the Blackhawk, when we do, we'll get a sense of internal communications [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  that might tell us exactly who was piloting that Blackhawk. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=217.2s)]
*  You had a captain in training. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=220.58s)]
*  You had a chief warrant officer, too, as an instructor. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=222.84s)]
*  And then you also had a staff sergeant in that Blackhawk as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=226.34s)]
*  Who was talking? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=228.9s)]
*  Who was on the comms? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=229.9s)]
*  Who was piloting? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=230.9s)]
*  And then what, if any confusion was there at the end? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=231.9s)]
*  We're looking at altitude. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=234.22000000000003s)]
*  And the president was clear about that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=236.34s)]
*  Someone was at the wrong altitude. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=238.06s)]
*  Yeah, we're not here to point fingers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  I don't think that President Trump or Pete Hegseth are as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=242.38000000000002s)]
*  When we look at how closely military operations were happening to civilian air traffic, how [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=245.26s)]
*  common is that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=250.66s)]
*  Is that very common? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=252.1s)]
*  Is it unique to DC? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  I'd love some insight on that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=254.7s)]
*  Well, hitting another aircraft is never common. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=257.06s)]
*  Around the DC area with all the military and civilian aircraft, it looks like controlled [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=261.86s)]
*  chaos, and it is, as long as it's controlled. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  If somebody doesn't do their job, bad things happen. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=269.02s)]
*  So I got to tell you, man, Occam's Razor, usually the most reasonable thing, they were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=272.84s)]
*  off course. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=279.2s)]
*  Route four through that corridor, they're supposed to hug the eastern side of the Potomac [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=280.44s)]
*  River. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  They were completely off course. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  They were in the middle of the Potomac. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  The max altitude is 200 feet on route four. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=289.5s)]
*  So you're all the way over to the east. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=292.88s)]
*  Do not go above 200 feet. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=295.84s)]
*  But when they said, hey, traffic in sight, the wrong traffic, they might have said, hey, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  there's nobody around us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  Maybe we can deviate a little bit for whatever reason. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  So there's two strikes right there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  Off course, off altitude. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  Third strike is the controller, as soon as he heard traffic in sight, since he was single [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=310.58000000000004s)]
*  manning two positions, put a mental check mark there that said, I'm busy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=315.6s)]
*  They have that other traffic in sight. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to focus on other things. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=322.44s)]
*  Yeah, never been there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=324.04s)]
*  Traffic control school. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  But I can almost guarantee you on day one, they tell you if you see two targets coming [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  at each other on your scope, even if one of those guys said traffic in sight, give them [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=330.56s)]
*  a harder traffic call. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=335.32s)]
*  Pack two five. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=337.32s)]
*  Confirm you have traffic left. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=338.52s)]
*  Eleven level. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=340.4s)]
*  Acknowledge that would have got the hair on the back of their neck and the helos standing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  up in this mishap wouldn't have happened. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  So a couple of links in this chain that if you took one of them out, this didn't happen [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=348.14s)]
*  in a tragedy unfolds. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=352.52s)]
*  Again, we're not here to point blame. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  We're here to try to understand what happened. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=356.64s)]
*  I'm sure we'll learn more as the days go on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=358.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=361.0s)]
*  And of course, thank you for your service. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=362.0s)]
*  You bet. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kka7gF7AFdo&t=363.92s)]
