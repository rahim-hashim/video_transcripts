# This Biden-Harris policy defies common sense: Former DHS official
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w)
*  Fox News alert an Afghan man living in Oklahoma charged with plotting an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=0.0s)]
*  election day terror attack right here in the U. S. On behalf of Isis. The 27 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  year old arrived in 2021 after the disaster with withdrawal of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=8.68s)]
*  Afghanistan. And just one day after Donald Trump gave this warning, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  the country has never been more unsafe. We have people pouring in through our [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=17.64s)]
*  southern border, which everyone's forgetting about right now because of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=20.96s)]
*  the travesty of Afghanistan. And if you look at the people coming in by the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=24.6s)]
*  hundreds by the thousands, and these are not the people necessarily that wanted [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=28.72s)]
*  the protection, right? These are people. So are they terrorists? How many [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=32.84s)]
*  terrorists are coming in? Well, at least one is former DHS Senior Advisor [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=36.12s)]
*  Charles Marino joins us now. Charles Fadman, Oklahoma, selling his stuff [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=40.36s)]
*  ready to do that do a major plot on Election Day. How concerned are you? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=44.28s)]
*  Well, very. I've been concerned from the start of this administration once [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  they unveiled their policies and stood down the policies of the Trump [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=53.66s)]
*  administration, which defied common sense when it comes to securing the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=57.8s)]
*  country. Look, this is all predictable and preventable. But Biden, Harris and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=61.92s)]
*  my orcas decided that they were going to proceed and go against the best [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=67.08s)]
*  practices when it comes to securing the homeland and implement policies that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=71.6s)]
*  actively undercut the very departments and agencies that were created in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=76.6s)]
*  aftermath of September 11th. They were able to tap into telegram and see his [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=81.28s)]
*  communications. They also he saved ISIS propaganda on his iCloud, participated [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=85.68s)]
*  in pro ISIS telegram groups, and he was here, not grateful, just thought what a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  great time to hit back in America. Wanted to sell all this stuff, get some [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  money. So when he died as a martyr, he'd be a hero. So think about how many other [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  27 year olds are like this that we brought over here out of the goodness of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=103.56s)]
*  our heart. Under President Biden, there were 375 that we know of that crossed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  from the terror watch list under Trump over four years. There was 11. That's an [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=112.08s)]
*  over 3000% increase. That's just across the southwest border. How could anyone [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=117.12s)]
*  feel good about that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=122.2s)]
*  Well, they shouldn't. And they're in every community now across the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=125.0s)]
*  And I can tell you the betting as far as that goes, the betting is only as good [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=129.0s)]
*  as the systems we bet against. And the truth is, is that of the 180 countries [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=132.64s)]
*  being encountered, many special interests locations, we just cannot thoroughly [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  that not only the people that we're encountering, but also you've got this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=143.36s)]
*  large growing bucket of gotaways, which has stayed at two million since the first [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  year of this administration, and in all reality is likely more closer to four or [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=153.28s)]
*  five million. So we've got people evading the system. We've got people exploiting [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=158.56s)]
*  the system when they're being encountered, because this is a rush to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=164.08s)]
*  process. This is a rush by this administration based on their politics to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=167.96s)]
*  quickly change the demographics of this country, despite what it does to our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=172.8s)]
*  overall national security. And this is a fact. And this was going to be a hit on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=177.24s)]
*  Election Day. And we know that Christopher Ray warned everybody about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=182.0s)]
*  this multiple times in multiple hearings. He is the FBI director. Thanks, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=186.08s)]
*  Charles. Appreciate it. You got it. Thanks. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZQucqlJ7w&t=189.52s)]
