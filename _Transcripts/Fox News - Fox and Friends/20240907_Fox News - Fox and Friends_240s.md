# Brenberg: Kamala Harris is going to have a hard time selling this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY)
*  The smartest economists in the world have said that Trump's plan would increase inflation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=0.0s)]
*  and land up in a recession by the middle of next year, so that the economists have said [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=7.8s)]
*  that his plan would cause middle-class families to pay almost $4,000 more a year in the very [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=12.96s)]
*  necessities they need every day because of his so-called plan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=20.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris claiming in a new interview that a Trump economy would hurt everyday Americans. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=24.36s)]
*  Just hours after her own administration released August dismal job numbers adding 18,000 fewer [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=29.66s)]
*  jobs than expected and revising June and July reports down 86,000 from what was initially [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=35.46s)]
*  reported. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=43.54s)]
*  So what pitch does Trump need to make to voters in Wisconsin today? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  The Big Money Show co-host Brian Brenberg joins us now to do math at 6 in the morning [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=48.86s)]
*  You don't want me doing math this early in the morning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=57.42s)]
*  So the job numbers came out for normal humans like me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  It's all very, very confusing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=63.5s)]
*  Big picture. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=65.5s)]
*  Not that confusing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=66.5s)]
*  The job creation is slowing down in America in a pretty significant way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=67.5s)]
*  We got a lower number than expected for August, but worse than that we keep getting these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=70.52s)]
*  downward revisions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  You've heard about this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=75.7s)]
*  So they give you a number in June, they give you a number in July, and then in August or [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=76.82s)]
*  September they tell you, hey, guess what, that number was actually lower by 50,000 or [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=80.98s)]
*  20,000. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=85.22s)]
*  And that's what's happening this summer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=86.26s)]
*  So what we're learning, Charlie, in retrospect, is that this summer job creation numbers per [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  month were like 100,000. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  And when you get in that territory, now you're starting to talk about recession territory. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  And that's what had the markets really worried yesterday. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  You saw stocks dropped because we've got this slowdown on our hands, it appears. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=104.62s)]
*  And so you have the Vice President talking about the smartest economists in the world [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=109.86000000000001s)]
*  and all this kind of stuff who supposedly support her. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=113.9s)]
*  I don't necessarily believe that necessarily. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=116.02s)]
*  Well, I don't even know who those guys are. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=117.38s)]
*  She's got all these economists, boatloads of economists. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=118.5s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=121.3s)]
*  But that is supposed to offset what people feel in their own wallets, in their own homes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't work like that in politics. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=127.1s)]
*  Well, no, she's saying that the Trump policy is going to create all this inflation and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=128.74s)]
*  make you poorer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=132.7s)]
*  And it's so easy for Trump because all he has to say is, well, the last time I did this, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=133.5s)]
*  I've done this before. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=139.02s)]
*  You actually had more money in your pockets because guess what? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=140.26s)]
*  Crazy idea. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=143.46s)]
*  When you cut taxes for people, they have more money. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=144.62s)]
*  I mean, that's how simple his pitch is right now for businesses, for people. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  If you're an investor, if you're a worker, doesn't matter if you earn tips, you can keep [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  more of your money. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=157.22s)]
*  So she's going to have a hard time selling that one. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=157.94s)]
*  Yeah. And the only thing she can really say about inflation is sorry. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  Now, what do you make of this whole issue of the foreign born workers where you have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=163.46s)]
*  more jobs created, taken by foreign born workers and actual an actual loss among [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=168.1s)]
*  American born? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=174.62s)]
*  It's a huge problem. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=175.34s)]
*  And I combine it with the other issue that we have, which is way more temporary jobs [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  than full time jobs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=182.3s)]
*  We've seen a decrease in full time jobs, an increase in temporary jobs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=183.34s)]
*  So if you're a native born American, you haven't been getting full time jobs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=187.3s)]
*  If you're a foreign born worker and maybe 50 percent of those could be illegal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=192.02s)]
*  migrants, maybe more than that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=196.38s)]
*  That what that tells you is this economy, like the baseline of this economy, Charlie, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=198.66s)]
*  is not firing on all cylinders. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=203.54s)]
*  It is struggling. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=205.7s)]
*  That's what people feel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=207.1s)]
*  We debate whether or not we're going to have a recession. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=208.22s)]
*  I think 50, 60, 70 percent of America feels like we're already in a recession because [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=210.82s)]
*  when you can't get a job and your wages aren't growing, you you aren't thriving. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=215.06s)]
*  You aren't living in a growing economy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  That is what a recession is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=221.42s)]
*  You explained the math and it didn't hurt. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=223.14s)]
*  I don't think I did a lot of math, but I think I did my best, Charlie. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=224.82s)]
*  The best. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_YCkbyIUhY&t=228.3s)]
