# WORLD OF 'HURT': Energy workers in key swing state fear a Harris presidency
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8)
*  All right, let's talk politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=0.0s)]
*  The vice president Kamala Harris insists she won't ban fracking today, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=1.6s)]
*  despite claiming otherwise back in 2019. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=6.24s)]
*  So yesterday I went to the swing state of Pennsylvania to the town of Zilia-Nopal [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  to speak with worried energy workers who say they don't trust Harris [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=12.72s)]
*  and her flip-flops on fracking. Watch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  You're part of the fracking process. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=19.76s)]
*  So we're on the completion side. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  We'll fracture the well and then following the frack, we'll come in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=23.68s)]
*  and drill out those plugs and then we'll run the production [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=27.04s)]
*  tubing to be able to bring the oil or gas online. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=30.0s)]
*  With this current administration, how's it impacting the energy business [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=32.64s)]
*  and your business specifically? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=36.96s)]
*  I think right out of the gate, the shockwave with the Keystone XL [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=38.4s)]
*  was a big hit to the industry. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=41.68s)]
*  What was life like four years ago under Donald Trump? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=43.28s)]
*  The regulation everywhere was a heck of a lot less. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=47.04s)]
*  It's much easier to work under a Trump administration than this administration by far. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=49.68s)]
*  Is it fair to say that the more regulations you guys have to endure, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=55.28s)]
*  the higher the prices are probably going to be when people go to the pump? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. No doubt about that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=63.84s)]
*  Why should Americans care about your company and what your employees do? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=65.12s)]
*  I would tell you the greatest thing about this industry, plain and simple, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=70.4s)]
*  is you can be an 18-year-old kid. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=74.16s)]
*  You don't have to go to college. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=76.32s)]
*  Year one, you're going to make $60,000 to $70,000. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=78.0s)]
*  To come into the energy industry, to be able to provide for their family, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=81.28s)]
*  to be able to change the trajectory of their family and be the one that was able to do that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=84.4s)]
*  I think that's really important and that's something that gets overshadowed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=88.4s)]
*  Let's talk with the guys that do this job every single day. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  So how did you start doing this job? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=95.84s)]
*  I broke out in 2017. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Turns out the oilfield was the perfect fit for me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=101.12s)]
*  You made a good living too. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. It's a primary source income for my family. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=104.72s)]
*  So how long you've been doing this? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=108.4s)]
*  I've been doing it for about three years. I've been in the oilfield. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  It's a good living for your family. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=113.6s)]
*  Of course, yes sir. Of course. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=114.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris, who's the vice president, was once against fracking. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=116.64s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=120.08s)]
*  She now says she's for fracking. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=122.16s)]
*  I will not ban fracking. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=124.0s)]
*  Do you believe her? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=125.28s)]
*  No. I believe she's out there saying whatever she can to make people, you know, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  try to swing her way so that she can try to get the presidency. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=130.32s)]
*  The sentiment around this whole region is nobody believes that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=134.32s)]
*  I don't believe anybody in that administration. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=137.92s)]
*  What do you believe happens if she becomes the president? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=140.8s)]
*  You're going to have even more regulation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=143.6s)]
*  You're going to have people that banks aren't going to want to invest. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=145.36s)]
*  You're going to see people move out of the areas where the drilling and gas is. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=149.12s)]
*  So why should everyday Americans care about what you do and what frackers do, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=154.4s)]
*  even if they're not a part of the industry? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=159.52s)]
*  I would say a lot of us guys out here, this is the way we feed our families [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=161.76s)]
*  and the way we take care of our lives really. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=166.4s)]
*  So there's not a whole lot in the world right now that doesn't rely on petroleum. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=169.6s)]
*  Okay. Everything that we are wearing, our glasses, plastics, you know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=173.84s)]
*  that's aside from trucking and fuel and all those other things [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=177.68s)]
*  that everybody thinks about on the general scheme. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=181.6s)]
*  But, you know, there's tens of thousands of us, probably more than that, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=184.88s)]
*  that we will all be standing in a bread line because if you shut the oil field down, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=188.16s)]
*  then, you know, like all my eggs are in this basket and lots of guys, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=192.64s)]
*  all our eggs are in the oil field. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=196.0s)]
*  Tell us about the impact domestically and those jobs shifting elsewhere, other countries. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=197.68s)]
*  You're choking the industry and you're choking that economy that way [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=202.72s)]
*  and not allowing that to happen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=206.32s)]
*  You have to look elsewhere to be able to work. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=207.52s)]
*  You have to look at going overseas, going south, South America, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=209.12s)]
*  going over to the Middle East to do that work. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  So now you have people that want to be here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=214.56s)]
*  They want to work here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=216.8s)]
*  We have the ability to be energy independent and do it here to be a superpower in the world [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  from an energy perspective. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=222.32s)]
*  And when you have the regulation that is hamstringing us from being able to do that, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=224.0s)]
*  it's really going to hurt all of us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3VeN-x6Ci8&t=229.12s)]
