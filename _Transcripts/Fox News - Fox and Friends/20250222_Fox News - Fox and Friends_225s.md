# Elon Musk’s DOGE tallies another week of wins for the Trump admin
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0)
*  Well, it's another big week of legal wins for Doge after judges allowed the agency to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=0.0s)]
*  continue slashing government waste. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=5.72s)]
*  In some of these cases, judges say Democrats haven't proved these cuts are causing any [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=7.76s)]
*  harm as President Trump touts the work Elon Musk and Doge are doing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I have today the highest poll numbers I've ever had. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=17.92s)]
*  They like the job that Elon's doing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=20.44s)]
*  He's doing something that a lot of people wouldn't have the courage to do. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=22.12s)]
*  We want our country to survive and thrive. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=24.96s)]
*  And we're finding billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse, billions, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=28.48s)]
*  and I mean numbers like you wouldn't believe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=34.32s)]
*  And we haven't even started yet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=36.76s)]
*  Constitutional law attorney and former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky joins us now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=40.84s)]
*  Katie, welcome. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  So this has been an interesting week, the left pushing back on these changes and the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=47.04s)]
*  courts siding with Elon Musk. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  I want you to talk about these cases. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Can I tell you my favorite one is the Catholic Church going up against the U.S. Catholic [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  Bishops Council saying you better give us the money and Elon Musk winning in that case, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=61.76s)]
*  although I think it's up for appeal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=66.88s)]
*  So talk to us about that and any other cases that you think are relevant. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=68.92s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the big picture with the Doge lawsuits is that many people on the left do [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  not like the idea of what President Trump and Elon Musk are doing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=78.44s)]
*  Legally speaking, there's not a strong argument against why they cannot do that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=82.32s)]
*  And certainly many people support President Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=86.88s)]
*  He ran on this campaign promise to cut out the waste of the federal government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=88.8s)]
*  So the lawsuits primarily focus on ideas that they're a violation of the Privacy Act or [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=92.8s)]
*  other sensitive information type systems or that Elon Musk does not have the authority [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=98.28s)]
*  to do this job because he's not Senate approved. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=104.35999999999999s)]
*  And essentially, we've seen many of these lower court judges, even ones that were appointed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  by Democrat presidents, disagree, at least at these preliminary stages. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  So certainly there's a lot of momentum for Doge and the legal arguments behind these [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=116.8s)]
*  moves are very strong. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=122.08s)]
*  Right, because Elon Musk is not Senate confirmed, but the power is vested in the president [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=123.76s)]
*  and he has given him the authority. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=128.2s)]
*  And there has something to do with the office that they took over that gives them him the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=130.08s)]
*  authority, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  This office that Obama had set up that now they changed the name to Doge, which now gives [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=134.64s)]
*  Elon Musk authority to do this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=140.72s)]
*  Can you talk to me about the U.S. the U.S. Council of Bishops Council case against Elon [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=142.44s)]
*  Musk and the Trump administration? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=149.6s)]
*  Well, the case essentially involves the idea that the president does retain this authority [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=151.6s)]
*  to make broad decisions regarding any of the funds that go from the well, not the funding [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=159.68s)]
*  essentially, but the agencies themselves. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=165.68s)]
*  And the argument on the other side, of course, is that Congress dictates the funding. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  But ultimately, big picture from the executive branch authority that does come from the White [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=172.12s)]
*  House and he is entitled to have advisors that give him advice about how to handle that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=176.96s)]
*  Elon Musk is not acting independent of the White House here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  He is acting at the behest of the president, which is something that the courts have recognized. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=185.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, that money, of course, to the Catholic Bishops Council is a lot of the migration money, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  the refugee settlement money, all of that used for illegal immigration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=195.48s)]
*  And as we know, so much of that has to do with the children who have been lost, 300,000 [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=199.64s)]
*  of them, of which so many of these NGOs, including the Catholic Church, are complicit in what [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=204.84s)]
*  has happened to these children. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=210.16s)]
*  So Katie Trzaskiewicz, we thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOMFF1ucku0&t=211.51999999999998s)]
