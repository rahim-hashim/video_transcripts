# Puerto Rican voters not fazed by comedian's joke: Makes no difference
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA)
*  Good morning Steve, Brian, Ainsley and Lawrence. Yes, welcome to North Carolina, one of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=0.0s)]
*  seven big swing states today. I was just listening to Pete in Wisconsin talking to young men [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=5.72s)]
*  about the way they're voting. Brock, by the way, is 16 years old, so he's not yet a voter, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=10.84s)]
*  but he's telling me already some of the issues that are most important to you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=14.76s)]
*  My major concern is for allowing boys in women's bathrooms. It really concerns me. We have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=18.8s)]
*  regulations of men's and women's bathrooms for a reason, and that's for safety and protection [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=25.56s)]
*  of privacy for both boys and women's, and it's a really concern, and we need to take [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=30.24s)]
*  care of this. You know, and Pete was mentioning, or one of his diners was mentioning that the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=36.2s)]
*  male cohort, this is so important to so many of those young men, but it's not just young [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=41.04s)]
*  men. Katie, 21 years old, a voter, and you mentioned the same thing as Brock. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=45.44s)]
*  Yes, and as a woman who is passionate about women's sports specifically, I just don't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=50.04s)]
*  believe in men competing in the same division as women, and you know, as a Christian as [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=54.88s)]
*  well, I want a president that supports those beliefs as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  So there you have it. That's some of the younger demographic here in the diner, but we got [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  everybody. By the way, who's voted already? If you early voted, raise your hand. Pretty [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  much everybody. A few voted this morning, and a few who are traditionalist plan to vote [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=73.84s)]
*  this afternoon because it, right Omar? It's what you do every year. So let me talk to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=78.44s)]
*  Joanne real quick. So Joanne was saying she's a senior, fixed income. And did you not want [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=83.64s)]
*  me to say that you're a senior? No, that's fine. I'm not going to lie like other people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  like Kamala. And you were saying that Ukraine's a big issue for you. Yes. I hope when Trump [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=95.2s)]
*  gets in, he says and looks at where all our money is being spent. He should have a list. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=102.56s)]
*  And if it's not a good one, then why give them the money? And I heard that a lot of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=110.08s)]
*  that money went to some of the Ukraine people that moved out of the country and they're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  paid their pensions. And you know, that's what you're saying. What about Americans? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=121.0s)]
*  That's the theme of a campaign and a presidency. It's about America first. Let me introduce [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=127.28s)]
*  you to Tyler. Tyler, hold up your phone. We talked about this a little bit earlier. So [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=131.92s)]
*  picture of Rachel's diner. Rachel right now is in Pennsylvania. And in the background [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=135.88s)]
*  of this picture is Tyler's mom. Your mom's in Pennsylvania. Mom's in Pennsylvania there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=141.48s)]
*  Right. You made a superior diner there. Look at on the screen now, Tyler. It looks like [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=146.48s)]
*  Rachel sitting with your mom right now. What do you want to say to your mom? Mom, I love [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  you. Wish I was home with you. I know I saw you a couple of weeks ago. We cast our ballot [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=154.32s)]
*  and this is a shout out to my sister. You know what to do. Go Trump. There you go Rachel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=157.96s)]
*  All right. Hey Tyler, your mom's here. He says he loves you and he's went to be voted. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=168.68s)]
*  He came back to vote and he says that you're going to vote and you know what to do. I do [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=176.52s)]
*  know what to do. Vote for Donald Trump. A message for your son. Pardon me? A message [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=181.4s)]
*  for your son. Go to work and have a great day and I'll see you soon. Love from mom, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=189.88s)]
*  Tyler. Love from mom. Here, I'm here with two Puerto Rican Americans. They're Boricuas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=196.88s)]
*  Boricuas. Here we are with Lola. Lola, tell me about what, you know, there was a joke. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=201.88s)]
*  A lot of people were concerned about the Latino vote, particularly the Puerto Rican vote here [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=206.6s)]
*  in Pennsylvania after that. What are your thoughts on it? Well, first of all, it was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  a joke by a paid comedian and the Puerto Rican people are much more resilient than people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=215.34s)]
*  give us credit. We're not easily offended and I don't think it's going to make a difference [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=220.02s)]
*  at all. Gloria, this by the way, this is Gloria is Lola's mom. Do you think this might change [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=225.5s)]
*  the vote for Latinos here in Pennsylvania? No, not at all. You're voting for Donald Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=230.86s)]
*  Tell me why. Yes, I'm going to vote for Donald Trump because he's the right person to be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=237.02s)]
*  in the White House. All right, right on. Okay, I want to bring you over here because I have [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=241.14s)]

*  immigrant here. He told me that he bought a house under the Trump administration when [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=261.94s)]
*  Trump was in office. Could you have bought a house under this administration? Never, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=266.74s)]
*  never. Why? Because all they do is lie and look at the economy, the inflation, groceries, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F3Mv1r-rLA&t=270.78000000000003s)]
