# Peter Doocy: Everything is on the table here
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs)
*  Alright, so at ten minutes after the hour turning out of Europe a live look at the Munich Security Conference in Germany [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Vance is there and is set to deliver remarks a little bit later this hour and the vice president's also expected to speak with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=5.32s)]
*  The Ukrainian president Zelensky as the Trump administration pushes for peace and Peter Ducey is live at the White House with more Peter [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=11.8s)]
*  I was reading that Marco Rubio his plane [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=18.42s)]
*  He was supposed to be in that meeting too and they had to go back because there was a problem with a cracked windshield [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=20.36s)]
*  He was gonna get on another plane. I think he did and try to head to that meeting. Did he make it? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Yes, we understand that the secretary is either just arriving or is on the way [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=30.36s)]
*  But they did have a cracked windshield somewhere over the Atlantic and had to circle back and change planes entirely so that the Air Force [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=34.56s)]
*  Could fix that back at Andrews [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=40.08s)]
*  But as we look at the next couple of hours [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=42.28s)]
*  We and really the next couple of weeks with this promise to end the Ukraine war by President Trump [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=44.6s)]
*  You've got plan a which is Vladimir Putin says that he wants peace according to Trump and he goes along with a peace deal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=49.72s)]
*  Plan B is according to something that we just heard punish Putin [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=56.66s)]
*  Maybe with sanctions and maybe even with military action [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=61.5s)]
*  That would be a break with statements that we've heard this week including from the defense secretary [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=65.94s)]
*  Hegseth that US troops will never be fighting in Ukraine vice president Vance now says [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=69.94s)]
*  Everything is on the table and Vance is in Munich to try to make a deal with Ukraine's Zelensky Ukraine wants some for to some [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=75.1s)]
*  form of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=82.9s)]
*  Security guarantee from the US the US wants Ukraine's rare earth minerals [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  Well, let's see [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=94.26s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth is in Poland right next door to Ukraine and very strategically important to US efforts to aid the Ukrainians [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=96.42s)]
*  We saw him doing PT with deployed servicemen and women again and urging NATO partners to increase [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  Spending to hold Vladimir Putin to whatever he and Trump and Zelensky come up with [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  As I mentioned you can have as many flags as you want [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=116.58s)]
*  but if you don't have hard power you're not an actual alliance and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=120.58s)]
*  Unfortunately our adversaries look at that and they judge accordingly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  Hegseth also said it's not his job to read the mind of Vladimir Putin [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=129.54s)]
*  But that he doesn't think you need to trust somebody to negotiate with them [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=133.42s)]
*  And so when we hear President Trump saying yesterday that he thinks Russia should be allowed to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=137.26s)]
*  Rejoin the G7 make it the G8 again something that they have not been a part of since [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  2014 when they invaded Ukraine that time it seems like the position of the administration is that is a negotiating [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=147.38s)]
*  Tactic that's kind of the carrot to try to get Putin to the table to make a peace deal back to you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  There's so many moving parts. Thanks so much Peter. It's just amazing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=161.66s)]
*  What what is going on because you have the Secretary of Defense who had the job for a week [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=165.72s)]
*  You have the director of national intelligence told see Gabbard heading over there had the job for 24 hours [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=169.16s)]
*  So you have the in real time the vice president just got the job to a one month ago [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=174.88s)]
*  Going over there saying this is who I am [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=179.4s)]
*  This is what I stand for and this is America's policy and I'm just watching some of the European television BBC [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=181.44s)]
*  Television and it's not the criticism from 2017. There's more of this is the deal. It's not up to me to judge [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=188.04s)]
*  We have to recalibrate and what's what my one message is getting through [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=194.8s)]
*  Europe has to spend on defense and they know and isn't it refreshing to see because we remember what happened when in Trump's first term [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=199.04s)]
*  To see everyone who works for him really going along with his agenda because even when when Pete was asked [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Troops on the ground in Ukraine and he said that's not my decision. That's the president's decision, right? And Brian your point about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=212.68s)]
*  Europe's gonna have to pay more [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=219.4s)]
*  Remember during his first administration [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=221.24s)]
*  He wanted to get everybody in NATO up to 2% [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=223.56s)]
*  Now it's a couple days ago. He said 5% but think about how Donald Trump works. He said 5% [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  He'll take three. He'll take four something like that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=234.28s)]
*  the other thing is over the and I do love when the president goes and has that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  wide-ranging chat with the press late in the afternoon because you learn so much and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=242.12s)]
*  What we've heard over the last couple of days regarding the negotiations between Trump and Putin, you know after they said [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=246.36s)]
*  We're talking we're working it out. Then Zelensky's going hey isn't Ukraine gonna be part of this negotiation? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=253.2s)]
*  And today the European Union's saying hey, wait a minute. Don't forget about us. We're right there [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=259.0s)]
*  We want to be part of it too. So it's like yeah. Yeah, you can do it, but we got to get this done [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNVuiScfCs&t=264.8s)]
