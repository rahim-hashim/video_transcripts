# Louisiana AG seeking answers from FBI as officials search for terror attack suspects
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4)
*  Let's bring in Louisiana Attorney General Liz Rural. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=0.0s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=2.92s)]
*  What is your latest thinking on the security? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=5.36s)]
*  I know you have said that perhaps [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=8.44s)]
*  another delay is in order. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=10.56s)]
*  What can you tell us this morning? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=12.64s)]
*  Well, obviously our first priority today [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=15.56s)]
*  is the safety of everybody in New Orleans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=17.72s)]
*  While we kind of carry out and go through with this game, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=19.88s)]
*  I did express some concern about that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=25.36s)]
*  I think that yesterday there were discussions [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=27.36s)]
*  about whether to have the game last night, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=30.2s)]
*  which I frankly thought was absurd. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=32.76s)]
*  We still had bodies that had to be removed from the ground [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=37.12s)]
*  in an open investigation to secure the crime scene. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=40.24s)]
*  And so, it seemed to me that that was not a hard decision [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=44.32s)]
*  to make even if the logistics of it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  might have been more complicated. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  You know, Madam Attorney General, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=50.92s)]
*  the latest that we heard was there were more suspects [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=52.84s)]
*  that helped this gentleman carry out this plot. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=56.2s)]
*  How do you have a game? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=58.6s)]
*  How do you have any type of mass event [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  when you have people potentially that contributed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  to this event that are still within the city [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=66.16s)]
*  or in greater Louisiana? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=72.04s)]
*  I think that we have a lot of law enforcement presence [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=73.84s)]
*  in New Orleans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  When I left there last night, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=78.14s)]
*  all I could see were blue lights all over downtown [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=79.68s)]
*  New Orleans and the French Quarter. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=82.92s)]
*  I know that the police have conducted a grid search [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=84.84s)]
*  of the entire area down in downtown [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=87.84s)]
*  and in the French Quarter and around the Superdome. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=91.0s)]
*  So, the governor has added 100 National Guard to that area [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=93.36s)]
*  to ensure that it is secure. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, there's a lot going on. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=101.54s)]
*  It's an active investigation of a crime scene [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  after a terrorist event. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=107.48s)]
*  And I don't think we could, I mean, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  it's not possible to take this too seriously. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=111.16s)]
*  Attorney General, I just wonder, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  are officials on the same page here? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=115.68s)]
*  I sense that you're not ready for this game to happen today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=117.36s)]
*  Well, you know, they didn't ask my opinion [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=122.72s)]
*  about whether it should or it shouldn't, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=124.6s)]
*  although I do have one. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=126.0s)]
*  I think that, you know, we certainly want to reassure people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=128.0s)]
*  that we feel like they are safe in New Orleans. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=130.96s)]
*  I just, I think this is a very serious event. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=133.36s)]
*  I would like to talk to the FBI this morning [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  and to reach out, my priority this morning [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=140.04s)]
*  is to reach out to the Department of Justice and the FBI [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=142.8s)]
*  and make sure that they are given top priority [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  to this investigation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=148.72s)]
*  The special agent in charge in New Orleans [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  is out of the country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, that's the individual who has the most experience [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  and knowledge about the city and experience [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=157.96s)]
*  with public officials in the city and in the state. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  So, I want to make sure that they are taking this seriously [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=163.24s)]
*  and that they have put all of their best resources [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  toward this investigation [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=170.0s)]
*  and that they are tracking these people down. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=171.32s)]
*  So, Madam Attorney General, if it was up to you, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  if they were asking your opinion [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=176.76s)]
*  and you were making the decision, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=178.12s)]
*  would you postpone this game today and for how long? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=179.92s)]
*  I would probably at least have postponed it till Friday, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  but, you know, I think that they have secured the city [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=188.44s)]
*  and, you know, it's okay, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=192.12s)]
*  I guess if they're going forward with it, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=196.76s)]
*  but I would probably have at least delayed it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  It feels like you don't feel comfortable about this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=201.44s)]
*  Well, you know, I was there while, you know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=205.6s)]
*  I was down out at the scene. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=208.24s)]
*  There's a lot of law enforcement presence [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=209.72s)]
*  in the entire downtown area. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=212.48s)]
*  I do feel like the city is secure, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  but, you know, we have 16 people who are dead. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=216.6s)]
*  Their families are grieving. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=221.2s)]
*  We have at least 10 more that are clinging to life [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=222.84s)]
*  in the hospital. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=225.88s)]
*  And, you know, I think that there's a certain degree [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=228.0s)]
*  of respect that we owe to the dead [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=231.12s)]
*  and to their families and the victims [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=232.88s)]
*  and to acknowledge and recognize [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  that this is an open investigation into a terrorist event. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  So, Madam Attorney General, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  I want to get back to the investigation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=243.52s)]
*  Do we have any shots of the people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=245.84s)]
*  that were potentially involved in this? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=248.44s)]
*  Do you all have any video of that? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=251.08s)]
*  And what about the people that were questioned [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=253.4s)]
*  by law enforcement [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  that you guys decided to release? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=256.48s)]
*  What do we know about their status right now? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=258.48s)]
*  Well, to be clear, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  the FBI is in charge of this investigation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  And so, you know, the information that we have received [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=268.0s)]
*  is coming through the FBI. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=271.8s)]
*  I have not received a lot of information from them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=275.16s)]
*  Yesterday, the priority was securing the scene [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  and responding to the immediate area, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=282.16s)]
*  making sure that it was secure. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, you guys have recognized already [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=288.56s)]
*  there are thousands of people right now in New Orleans. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=290.48s)]
*  The hotels were full. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=293.36s)]
*  And, you know, it's a complicated situation to manage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  So, I think it is... [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, the one upside, I think, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  of going ahead and having the game [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=302.88s)]
*  is that those folks are gonna go ahead [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=304.92s)]
*  and leave after the game is over. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's gonna make this easier. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, I'm sorry to interrupt you, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=311.44000000000005s)]
*  but I just want to get a clear answer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=313.44000000000005s)]
*  The FBI has not updated you on the people [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=316.44s)]
*  that they released from custody [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=319.12s)]
*  that they interviewed yesterday? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=320.44s)]
*  To tell you if this is incredible? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=322.12s)]
*  Not just, no. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=323.48s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=324.56s)]
*  You're the Attorney General of the state, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  and they haven't given you any information [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  on people that could have been involved with this? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  Are they stonewalling you? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=332.04s)]
*  What's happening there? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, I think that, again, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=335.2s)]
*  it was a fluid situation yesterday. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=337.12s)]
*  A lot of public officials all kind of wrapped their... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=339.56s)]
*  Wrapping their arms around the situation [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=342.6s)]
*  this morning. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  So, you know, I'm not ready to say that I'm being stonewalled, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  but my first priority this morning [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  is to reach out to them [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=351.48s)]
*  and make sure that they are communicating with me [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  and that they are updating me [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  on the current status as it's happening. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=357.04s)]
*  And I want reassurance that we have the top people [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=359.6s)]
*  in charge on the ground in New Orleans. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=363.44000000000005s)]
*  Could more have been done in advance of this attack [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=366.56s)]
*  to have prevented it, do you believe? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=369.36s)]
*  You know, I don't think there's ever an event like this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  where we don't look back on it and say, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=376.08s)]
*  could we have done more [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=377.08s)]
*  and potentially identify ways that we could have done more. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=378.56s)]
*  My first question, I know the governor's first question, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=382.64s)]
*  as we, you know, went into New Orleans yesterday morning [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=385.76s)]
*  after waking up to this, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=388.88s)]
*  was to ask what kind of bollards, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=390.56s)]
*  what kind of positioning was placed [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  at the front of Bourbon Street, you know? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=398.92s)]
*  So I think everybody is rightfully asking those questions, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=401.76s)]
*  but I can also tell you that there are thousands of people [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  in New Orleans, probably from January through March, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=408.24s)]
*  and the streets are always full. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=411.8s)]
*  There are parades almost every single day. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=414.12s)]
*  So, you know, could they have secured that area better? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Probably so. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  Were there other soft targets in areas [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=422.64s)]
*  where this individual could have hit multiple people? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=424.88s)]
*  That would, yes, the answer to that would be yes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, if I heard you correctly, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=430.12s)]
*  I believe you just said that there were 16 dead. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=432.08s)]
*  We have been given the official number at 15. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=435.0s)]
*  Do you wanna clarify that? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=437.96s)]
*  Well, there were, I know that they confirmed yesterday [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  that were 15. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=442.52s)]
*  I have heard the number 16 as well. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=443.44s)]
*  So, I mean, I'll stick with 15 until we hear otherwise, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  but yesterday the number was a little bit fluid. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=449.76s)]
*  The coroners have not confirmed some of the numbers, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=453.44s)]
*  and the numbers that I was seeing coming out of the hospital [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=458.32s)]
*  suggest that it might be 16. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=460.8s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, I wanna get you your comment [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  on the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=465.48s)]
*  outside of Trump International in Las Vegas. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=467.36s)]
*  Apparently the suspect in that case used the same app [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=470.48s)]
*  that the suspect used in New Orleans. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=475.0s)]
*  Have you had any communication with your counterpart [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=477.48s)]
*  or the FBI on that? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=479.6s)]
*  Is there a link that you can tell us about this morning? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=480.8s)]
*  I don't know whether there's a link to the two. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=484.68s)]
*  Obviously it is very suspicious, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=488.44s)]
*  and that raises even more concerns. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=490.88s)]
*  At the very least, it raises concerns about the use of this app [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  and whether it is a means of coordinating [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=497.64s)]
*  or carrying out terrorist kinds of events. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=501.48s)]
*  So, I think that there are a lot of questions that we all have [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  and that we all need answered, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=509.08s)]
*  and we need them answered sooner rather than later. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=510.44s)]
*  Sounds like you are awaiting some of those answers [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  as you await contact with some of those [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=516.04s)]
*  federal authorities in charge, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  and we hope to get more answers [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=518.8399999999999s)]
*  in the next couple hours as well. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=520.16s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOM5d9rNtb4&t=521.6s)]
