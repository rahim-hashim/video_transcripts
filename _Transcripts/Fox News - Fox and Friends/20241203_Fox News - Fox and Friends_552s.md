# Doocy: KJP left a 'terrible stain' on the press secretary job
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA)
*  So President Biden is traveling or he went to Africa to Angola and we reported yesterday we were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=0.0s)]
*  we were told that KJP wouldn't be having a press briefing she was on the plane on Air Force One so [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=6.72s)]
*  some of the reporters did ask her some questions about pardoning exactly and so we have some sound [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  from her we don't have a video of her because she is on the plane but this is what she said about [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=17.04s)]
*  about the reason that President Biden pardoned his son. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=23.12s)]
*  Does the president believe now and agree with President-elect Trump that the justice system [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=26.32s)]
*  has been weaponized for political purposes and that it needs root and branch reform? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=33.36s)]
*  No read the president's statement seriously read the president's statement he said he believes [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=40.96s)]
*  in the Department of Justice he does he also believes that rural politics infected the process [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=46.0s)]
*  led to a miscarriage of justice he believes his son was unfairly targeted he said that what his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=51.04s)]
*  political opponents have done to my son that's his words is cruel and enough is enough. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=57.12s)]
*  Does she lie she just makes stuff up yeah she's saying that politics have gotten involved in the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=63.44s)]
*  justice system which they lauded as the believing in the justice you can't believe in the justice [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=68.16s)]
*  system and since they politics got involved in the justice system and it's affected this case [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=73.52s)]
*  that means it affected David Weiss who you left on the job that I mean affected the deal that fell [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=78.16s)]
*  apart because an unbiased judge looked at and said I've never seen anything like that and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=82.16s)]
*  everyone agrees they couldn't which is so amazing is she's got to be embarrassed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=85.92s)]
*  because she was assured over and over again this pardon wasn't coming. Senator Michael Bennett [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=89.92s)]
*  upset by it by the Biden's decision put personal interest ahead of duty. Democrat Gary Peters [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=94.4s)]
*  present by his decision pardon his son was wrong. Senator Peter Welch President Biden's pardon of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=100.4s)]
*  his son is the action of a loving father understandable but the action of our nation's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=105.68s)]
*  chief executive is unwise. It goes on and on and on and I just think about all those people that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=109.28s)]
*  want to bat for the paragon of justice and and ethics and saying how great Joe Biden was for not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  pardoning his son now to sit there and say after he pardoned his son man don't I look stupid and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  if you had to daily show last night even that was if that is the one thing that stood out I didn't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=127.84s)]
*  realize how many were taking a bow for Joe Biden's noble stand which we all knew he was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=133.28s)]
*  going to reverse because of course he was not going to let his son go to jail. I just think the line here is just [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=139.12s)]
*  stunning and you know we talk about all the former Trump admin people how they struggled you know [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=143.84s)]
*  typically after you've worked in the White House you get these big corporate jobs it's just the way [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=149.52s)]
*  of things. How does she get a job after the constant lying over and over again even in that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=153.2s)]
*  moment she just makes up what's in the statement. The statement did not say that and then number two [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=160.08s)]
*  this is two times where the the president has been at odds with his department of justice. The first [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=166.08s)]
*  time was when the special counsel said essentially he cannot stand trial because he's mentally [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=171.68s)]
*  incapable to stand trial right and his attorney general allowed that to happen. This is the next [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  time when his department of justice said that it was time to bring charges against his son [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=182.4s)]
*  and he's now saying that his department of justice is political. The question is will we hear from [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=188.24s)]
*  the attorney general on this? Where is his statement on this? He's taking on his department will he [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=193.84s)]
*  defend his men and women? Well we've heard from David Weiss the special counsel and he says it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=199.12s)]
*  look it wasn't political a grand jury returned an indictment and that's why we proceeded with this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=204.48s)]
*  You know he bragged about this in his book. He writes that he did this. Right right right. We all knew that Joe Biden [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  was going to pardon a full and unconditional pardon 400. We knew that. We knew that for over a year [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=217.6s)]
*  but for KJP, KJP looks terrible and here's the thing. She said she's been she has been emphatic. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=226.56s)]
*  She's positive. No pardon. No pardon. No pardon. She has told that lie maybe she could rationalize it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=234.32s)]
*  as Joe's lie for years. If she had any standards she as soon as she heard the president was going [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=240.88s)]
*  to pardon his son she should have quit. She could have gone out on a high note instead she is part [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=248.32s)]
*  of his legacy of lies and it is it is a it is a terrible stain on the press secretary for the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  for the White House for the United States for to for her to be a a conduit for so many mistruths. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=263.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay if you work for someone and they keep telling you say this say this this is what I'm going to do [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=272.08s)]
*  I'm not going to pardon I'm not going to pardon you go out there in front of the entire world [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  and you say you repeat what he told you you trust him to you know to be honest. Right. So then when [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=281.28s)]
*  he says okay I'm going to pardon if I were KJP and I were in the room I would say respectfully sir [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=288.24s)]
*  I can't go out there and say well we're blaming it now on politics and blah blah blah because you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=294.32s)]
*  already put me in a position to say no I would say I would say he changed his mind. You know he [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  already lost one son and now I would you'd have to be honest you'd have to say tell us not to believe [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=305.2s)]
*  what we're reading and the statement says and the other thing is Steve I think you're right she [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=310.8s)]
*  should have resigned but she should also she's been lying for three years when she said that the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=315.92s)]
*  president is healthy mentally of course that he's been working 10 hours a day that he outworks us all [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=320.48s)]
*  and we can't keep on the circles that is that is a no one told her to say that she is just saying [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=325.36s)]
*  I'm going to lie every day about what is actually going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the Oval [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=330.8s)]
*  Office and there is nothing I'm surprised there's no cobwebs because he has not been running the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=337.04s)]
*  country. Well you know ultimately it Ainsley it doesn't sound like KJP tried to talk Joe Biden out [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=342.88s)]
*  of the pardon but there are stories now circulating that it sounds like Jill Biden Dr. Jill Biden maybe [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=349.52s)]
*  actually was pushing Joe. Joe apparently didn't know whether or not it was the right thing to do [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=356.08s)]
*  and it sounds like she Jill Biden who remember went to the trial every day in Delaware it sounds [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=362.88s)]
*  like she was saying hey come on of course I support the pardon of my son. Well it looks like [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=369.84s)]
*  it was definite in June. Someone is trying to salvage the Democratic Party I mean this just makes [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=373.84s)]
*  them look bad their their entire campaign or salvage well take your pick Joe Biden savaged [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  just take your pick on it Senator Joe Manchin says they should just pardon Trump let's watch it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  we do it okay stand by this too okay what I would have done differently my recommendations the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=393.52s)]
*  council would have been why don't you go ahead and pardon Donald Trump for all his charges and make [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=398.96s)]
*  it you know it had been it had gone down a lot more balanced if you will I'm just saying wipe them out. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=404.24s)]
*  James Comer says next look for his brother and he's going to be the next president of the United [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=412.0s)]
*  States. James Comer says next look for his brother and you have to pardon his brother's brothers all [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=419.76s)]
*  over this trading on the family name for 20 years. I honestly think their superstition that Trump is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=425.36s)]
*  it's just they just got it all wrong there was no plan to go after the Bidens he's the type of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  person just like a UFC fight once he's beaten you he's done he's done the fight is over and he's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=437.92s)]
*  moved on he made it very clear that he wasn't going to go after the Biden so this fear that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=443.76s)]
*  they have they're kind of telling on themselves I mean to retroactively pardon him years later [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=449.68s)]
*  and then to do it right before Burisma I mean in 2014 yeah it's it's not just retroactive it's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=457.84s)]
*  proactive yes exactly he's he's pardoning him for stuff that he's been convicted of but not [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=464.56s)]
*  but he is also got the get out of jail free card for anything that happened during that time and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=470.8s)]
*  we were talking yesterday with one of the legal experts and it's like how long do we wait before [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=476.24s)]
*  he he issues a blanket pardon for the entire family and they said the meter is running [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  because ultimately Joe Biden has that superpower and he can do it the question is does he feel [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=484.8s)]
*  there is peril for his family to the point where he's got to do that his own party is really [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=491.36s)]
*  PO'd at him there have been a lot of Democrats that have come out to you against this and said [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=497.76s)]
*  he shouldn't have done it and I like what representative Greg Stanton Democrat from [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=502.24s)]
*  Arizona what he said he says this wasn't a politically motivated prosecution Hunter [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers because now they're saying he's in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=511.44s)]
*  this position because not because he actually broke the law he's in this position because I'm [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=516.56s)]
*  the president and this is my son and I put him in this position and he singled out because of who I [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=522.0s)]
*  international business deal said he was linked to he forgot to continue that sentence but he was in [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=527.6s)]
*  rush the plane was running Angola was calling and he had to get out of there and that's going well [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=531.6s)]
*  too he forgot to address Africa for four years China's taking it over more on that later I'm [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetiVIvSLkA&t=536.16s)]
