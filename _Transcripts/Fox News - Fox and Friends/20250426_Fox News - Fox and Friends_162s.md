# Jonathan Morris: A ‘page has turned’ after Pope Francis’ death
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M)
*  Well, let's bring in Jonathan Morris, who has been there with Martha all morning long [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=0.0s)]
*  in Rome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=4.88s)]
*  What a great assignment, Jonathan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=5.88s)]
*  I'm a little jealous over here sitting on the curvy couch. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=6.88s)]
*  What's it feel like for you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=11.08s)]
*  You've had quite your own journey within the church. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=12.72s)]
*  What does it feel like for you to be there in this moment and on the precipice here of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=16.1s)]
*  us selecting another pope? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=22.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=24.6s)]
*  I lived here for nine years, Rachel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=26.16s)]
*  One thing that's great about coming back to Rome is that nothing has changed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  The eternal state. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=32.68s)]
*  Nothing has changed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=33.68s)]
*  You leave New York for two years and you come back and none of the restaurants are there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=36.32s)]
*  You come back to Italy ten years later, twenty years later, and it's all the same. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=40.08s)]
*  And what's mostly, you know, the epicenter of no change, so to speak, is the Vatican, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=46.0s)]
*  the church, and the amazing culture that's here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=54.52s)]
*  So yes, it's very exciting to be back. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Rome, sweet Rome. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Or you're right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=64.76s)]
*  I mean, it's home. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=65.76s)]
*  It feels like home to you in some ways, right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=66.76s)]
*  So it absolutely does. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=69.0s)]
*  And this is the exciting time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  Yes, now a page has turned and now we're going on to the next chapter. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  This is going to be the big event. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=77.76s)]
*  And we're choosing another pope. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  I mentioned earlier the great Italian phrase, morto un Papa, senni fa un altro. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  It's a very kind of irreverent way that the Romans say a pope has died, but we can make [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=89.64s)]
*  another one. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  And that's what's going to happen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  It's not the Holy Spirit that chooses the next pope. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=97.32s)]
*  Maybe that sounds terrible. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=101.96s)]
*  It's not. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  Because God always respects human agency, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=104.52s)]
*  It will be the cardinals selecting a pope and hopefully inspired by the Holy Spirit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=107.84s)]
*  And when you mentioned, Rachel, that passage in the gospel that says that the gates of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=114.2s)]
*  hell will not prevail against the church, that is true. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=119.64s)]
*  But there's no statement in the gospel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=124.12s)]
*  Jesus never said that there will be a perfect church. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=126.72s)]
*  There is a human factor. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=130.68s)]
*  There's a human factor wherever there are human beings. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=132.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=136.44s)]
*  And human beings, we make a mess of it sometimes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=137.76s)]
*  You can only make things so much idiot proof before humans manage to get their paws all [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=140.04s)]
*  over it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=145.44s)]
*  Jonathan Morris, thank you so much. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5opAz29Po5M&t=146.44s)]
