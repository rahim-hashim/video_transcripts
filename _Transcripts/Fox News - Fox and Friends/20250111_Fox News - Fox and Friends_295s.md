# Private chef makes meals for first responders and displaced families amid wildfires
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ)
*  Well, more than 37,000 acres have burned throughout Southern California, killing 11 and destroying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  10,000 homes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=7.44s)]
*  Our next guest is a high-end chef in the area, and she's stepping up to provide meals to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=9.76s)]
*  those in need. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=14.36s)]
*  Come with me to private chef for the entire hurting city of Los Angeles. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=18.04s)]
*  My effort to feed the 3,500 firefighters fighting on the front lines and the over 10,000 displaced [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  families in need of nourishing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Hundreds of meals served, over $25,000 raised, but this is only day one. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=29.72s)]
*  Private chef Brooke Bavinski joins us live from Los Angeles. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=37.0s)]
*  Brooke, it's so great to have you on, and the food looks delicious, by the way. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=41.56s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about your efforts, how you're doing it, and where are you getting [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=45.92s)]
*  all the supplies and the supply chain, which I thought might have been disrupted because [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=50.16s)]
*  of the fires? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  And how your operation is going. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=56.8s)]
*  Yes, thank you for having me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=58.36s)]
*  I would say the community of LA is in mourning right now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=60.64s)]
*  There's so much tragedy going on, but we are all doing what we can. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  And for me, as a professional chef, I knew I needed to make meals for those in need, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  and the community has stepped up to help in such incredible ways. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=75.32s)]
*  Local farms donating supplies, hundreds of volunteers asking how they can be of assistance, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=79.32s)]
*  people offering kitchens. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=84.7s)]
*  I've partnered with Holy Smokes Kosher Barbecue in LA, who's given me a kitchen and food, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=87.54s)]
*  and the support is tremendous. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=94.18s)]
*  In just a couple of days, we've raised over $75,000 to provide high-quality, nutritious, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  and high-protein meals for those in need. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=102.42s)]
*  The 3,500 firefighters just in LA fighting the front lines, the 10,000 families displaced [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  that have absolutely nothing and in need of immediate nourishment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=111.06s)]
*  So seeing the community come together is really what's fueling me to work day in and day out, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=115.22s)]
*  18-hour days to get hundreds of meals out every single day to those in need. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  What's been the reaction? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=124.94s)]
*  There's been a tremendous amount of support. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=130.18s)]
*  Everyone is heartbroken and devastated in LA, but people are asking, what can I do? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  How can I help? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=140.9s)]
*  I don't just want to sit around. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=141.9s)]
*  Can I deliver meals? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=142.9s)]
*  Can I open up my kitchen? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=144.9s)]
*  And that's been incredible from a local standpoint, and people all around the world are asking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=148.18s)]
*  me how they can help, and donations and supplies and everything is flooding in and it is very [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=152.5s)]
*  heartwarming. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=160.42s)]
*  Brooke, what percentage of the meals that you're providing are going to first responders [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=161.42s)]
*  versus those who are displaced? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=166.1s)]
*  And how are those who are displaced, are you taking them to shelters? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=167.94s)]
*  The foods to shelters, are they coming to you? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=170.7s)]
*  How is this all working? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  We want to make sure the meals are delivered hot and when they are fresh. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=174.82s)]
*  So we are personally getting volunteers, if not ourselves, to deliver them to fire stations [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=178.66s)]
*  ourselves, going out into the front lines, into Topanga, into the Palisades, into Pasadena, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=184.38s)]
*  and physically handing the meals to firefighters that are fighting to make sure they get food. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  And then communicating with families directly who have absolutely nothing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=196.38s)]
*  So going to organizations, nonprofits have been reaching out, shelters have been reaching [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=201.48s)]
*  out with specific families in need of immediate meals and assistance. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=208.22s)]
*  So personal deliveries, delivering to apartment buildings, people have been taking people [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=212.54s)]
*  in in droves and housing two, three families in their, in whatever, however they can host [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=217.94s)]
*  them. So personal deliveries. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  But I'm there from in the kitchen early morning to late at night. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  And I have cooking meals, half delivering meals and everyone is offering their help and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=234.17999999999998s)]
*  assistance. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=240.22s)]
*  Well, Brooke, it's just so heartwarming to hear what you've done, the kind of effort you've [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=241.22s)]
*  put into it and the kind of initiative that you have. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=244.33999999999997s)]
*  That's the can do American spirit and the generosity of the people who have reached out to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  you with donations. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=250.74s)]
*  And, you know, it's so discombobulating to be displaced from your home and a warm meal, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=251.94s)]
*  I'm sure, is just such a relief and even just a sign that we all care about what they're [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=257.42s)]
*  going through. So, Brooke, thanks so much for joining us and good for you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=262.84s)]
*  Just so proud of you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. It's only day three. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=268.86s)]
*  We have a lot more to go, but we're off to a positive change and start. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YbCBodhWPQ&t=270.78s)]
