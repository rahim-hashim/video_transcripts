# Hosts roast Chuck Schumer: 'No one believes this!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ)
*  And Chuck Schumer doesn't do many interviews either. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, he was on, and he was asked about, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=2.96s)]
*  could Joe Biden have served another four years? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=6.84s)]
*  He said, it doesn't matter. It's hypothetical. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=9.36s)]
*  He also said this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=11.0s)]
*  I want to play you a little bit of something [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=15.72s)]
*  you said last year. Take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=17.48s)]
*  I talk to President Biden, you know, regularly, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=19.84s)]
*  or sometimes several times in a week, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=23.56s)]
*  or usually several times in a week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=25.96s)]
*  His mental acuity is great. It's fine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=28.2s)]
*  It's as good as it's been over the years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=31.28s)]
*  All this right-wing propaganda that his mental acuity [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=33.24s)]
*  is declined is wrong. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=36.12s)]
*  Leader Schumer, what do you say to Americans [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=38.44s)]
*  who feel as though you and other top Democrats [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=41.32s)]
*  misled them about President Biden's mental acuity? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=43.92s)]
*  No. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Look, we didn't. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=48.68s)]
*  And let's look at President Biden. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=49.84s)]
*  He's had an amazing record. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  When he stepped down, he did it on his own [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=54.92s)]
*  because he thought it was better, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=57.92s)]
*  not only for the Democratic Party, for America. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=59.2s)]
*  We should all salute him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  No one believes that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  No one believes it. And if you look at the president, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=64.88000000000001s)]
*  even that outbursts of the press, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=67.08s)]
*  which I don't even know what he means [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=68.72s)]
*  about talking about world leaders. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  He should know more world leaders than anybody. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=72.16s)]
*  This is just part of the job. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  But the anger and the symptoms that he's displaying. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=75.64s)]
*  Exactly. I don't like that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=80.04s)]
*  It's the thing that we've all seen with people that we love [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=81.72s)]
*  that have gone through this period of time in their life. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=86.28s)]
*  And the fact that no one in his inner circle, his wife, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  the children will say, dad, it's time to hang it up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=93.8s)]
*  And they were prepared to let him be president [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=97.28s)]
*  for another four years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=99.44s)]
*  I just, it just speaks to the power hungerness in Washington. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  It's so sad to witness what we're seeing of a president. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=105.64s)]
*  He still has new court codes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=108.96s)]
*  I'm angry. Well, here's the thing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  Kristen Welker asked a great question, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  set it up with Chuck Schumer's own words, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  and the reason he was dismissive of her premise [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=116.16s)]
*  is because she was right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=119.16s)]
*  And they, the people who protected Joe Biden's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  cognitive decline have been caught. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=124.4s)]
*  And that's why it's so curious. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=127.4s)]
*  If the guy is on the way down, he's spinning out of control, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=129.24s)]
*  he's just not the guy he was four years ago, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  why is he still president? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  Why didn't they invoke the 25th amendment months ago? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=138.68s)]
*  Shut up. Years ago, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=142.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris would be historic. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=143.32s)]
*  She would have been the first president. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=144.88s)]
*  She wouldn't have been Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=146.64s)]
*  Female president, that is to say. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=147.48s)]
*  She wouldn't have been Trump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=149.04s)]
*  No, Brandon, I'm saying had the 25th amendment, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  they replaced him, but they've all been caught. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=154.2s)]
*  Everybody in Democrat world has got a lot of explaining to do [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=156.56s)]
*  and they will have to in the next year. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=161.48s)]
*  Do they not love this country more than that though? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, to lie to us and tell us he was fine, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=166.88s)]
*  they were just gonna prop him up like we can at Bernie's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=169.32s)]
*  and just make us all believe that, you know, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=172.16s)]
*  he was in the game and in the party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=174.32s)]
*  I mean, it's just, it's not fair to the American people. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=176.52s)]
*  It's not fair to the soldiers whose lives are on the line [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=179.36s)]
*  when he's the commander in chief. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=182.2s)]
*  So true. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=183.48s)]
*  By the way, on Afghanistan, that was solely his decision. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=184.32s)]
*  Jake Sullivan saying that, you know, I feel bad. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=186.88s)]
*  I offered to resign because I was unable to execute [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  the president's decision. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=191.52s)]
*  So Blinken wasn't his idea, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=192.84s)]
*  although he says he's no regrets. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=194.56s)]
*  It was his sole decision to have the worst catastrophe [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=196.72s)]
*  in American military history. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=200.2s)]
*  Jonathan Martin, network anchor and commentator, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=201.84s)]
*  said, well, you know, why don't people, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=205.04s)]
*  one of the people that was the chief of staff [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=206.88s)]
*  for Kamala Harris yesterday, Simone Sanders, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=208.72s)]
*  came out and said, he's fine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=211.88s)]
*  Press secretary. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=212.72s)]
*  People should defend him better. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=213.56s)]
*  And Jonathan Martin says, well, it's not worth defending [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=214.76s)]
*  because at every turn over the last year and a half, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  he has taken the path of the most indulgent turn [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=219.32s)]
*  for himself rather than was good for the party by running, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=221.2s)]
*  by parting his son, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=223.88s)]
*  and now some of his choices are the Medal of Freedom. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Wow, you would never have gotten that a year ago. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=227.28s)]
*  And then yesterday, a couple of days ago, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=229.72s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=231.84s)]
*  he was asked about getting hostages out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=232.84s)]
*  He came back and said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  do you think you can keep from getting hit in the head [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  with a camera behind you? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=238.56s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=240.68s)]
*  So just that bad answer was a non-secretary. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  He was not even asked about that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  I get very little credit to the people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  that are talking about this now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  According to the reports, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  and the Wall Street Journal has done extensive reporting, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  they knew a year into his presidency [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=252.96s)]
*  that they were crafting the cabinet meeting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=256.04s)]
*  so he didn't have to answer questions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=258.56s)]
*  And now they want to talk about it after he's lost, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=261.0s)]
*  after he fell apart [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=263.79999999999995s)]
*  in front of the entire country for the debate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  It's way too late to be talking about it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=267.76s)]
*  His speech is gonna be ugly that he gives. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=269.88s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=271.88s)]
*  Well, and it'll be curious to see how he explains [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  the withdrawal from Afghanistan [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=275.2s)]
*  if it's all about foreign policy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=276.64s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=278.24s)]
*  He gave an interview about a week ago [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=280.56s)]
*  while we were on vacation, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  and he feels in his heart of hearts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=284.08s)]
*  That he would have won. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=286.44s)]
*  He would have beaten Donald Trump [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=287.28s)]
*  had he not been stabbed in the back [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=288.72s)]
*  by Nancy Pelosi and all the other Democrats. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=291.12s)]
*  But then again, it's just one of those things. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  If he keeps calling out Nancy Pelosi, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJQBW_vyLQ&t=296.92s)]
