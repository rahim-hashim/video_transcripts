# Top foods to boost your immune system
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY)
*  With the height of cold and flu season just around the corner, what can you eat to boost [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=0.0s)]
*  your immune system and stay healthy? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=8.08s)]
*  Well here to answer that question and more is Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=9.96s)]
*  Sapphire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=14.84s)]
*  I love this segment, I love this topic Nicole because food is medicine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=15.84s)]
*  If you're eating right, you can actually prevent sicknesses, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Amen and I think I'm going to take this entire basket home with me because it has all of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  my favorite things in it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=29.32s)]
*  So let's just dive right in. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=30.92s)]
*  It is certainly cold, flu and COVID season right now and what can we do to boost our [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=31.92s)]
*  immune system because you nailed it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=36.42s)]
*  We want to prevent illness because once you already get infected, I'll be honest, there [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=38.08s)]
*  are not a lot of things to relieve some of your cold and flu symptoms. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=42.04s)]
*  But here are some of the most immune boosting things that you could eat. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=45.44s)]
*  Okay, let's go. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=48.8s)]
*  Did you know that a red bell pepper, if you eat one of these raw, this has more than twice [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=49.8s)]
*  the amount of the daily recommended dose of vitamin C. Vitamin C obviously is great for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=53.96s)]
*  our immune system. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=58.32s)]
*  Yes, if you grill it, if you boil it, it does reduce the vitamin C a little bit but it's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=59.32s)]
*  still excellent and has other nutrients in it as well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  I actually slice this and give it to my kids almost every morning before school. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=67.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=71.64s)]
*  Blueberries, this is a super food. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=72.64s)]
*  It is nature's powerhouse. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=74.36s)]
*  It is, when it comes to your, all of your fruits and veggies, this has one of the most [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=75.8s)]
*  highest amount of jam pack antioxidants, low calorie, low sugar content. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=81.08s)]
*  Just grab a handful, it's great for you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  You can put it in like Greek yogurt, get your probiotics, get this too at the same time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=87.56s)]
*  You can be fancy or you can just literally grab a handful. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  That's what I tend to do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=95.04s)]
*  Citrus, obviously oranges, lemons give you a high amount of vitamin C. They also have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=96.68s)]
*  higher sugar content so if you're diabetic or pre-diabetic you have to be careful with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=100.92s)]
*  that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Even if you're just juicing it yourself? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm not talking about juicing it in a carton. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  It's a high sugar content especially if you get the pre-packaged, the concentrated juice [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  It comes from the store that has a lot of sugar in it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=114.2s)]
*  You have to be careful. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  The best way is the most fresh and it's just to be making it or eating it yourself. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Nicole, my daughter does every morning, she makes it in advance. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=121.76s)]
*  Turmeric, orange, lemon and ginger juice every morning. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=126.64s)]
*  So we have talked about that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=130.88s)]
*  That is essentially kind of what I do. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=132.12s)]
*  I like to make a green version of that with spinach, celery, turmeric, ginger, lemon and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=134.16s)]
*  some other stuff. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=140.44s)]
*  This is just jam packed with vitamins C, B, E. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=141.48s)]
*  Are you juicing it or putting it in the Vitamix or the blender? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  Juicing it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=148.42s)]
*  We like to juice it but then we also do blend a lot of this as well but I'm going to be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=149.42s)]
*  honest we don't all live on a farm. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=152.28s)]
*  We don't all have a lot of time during the morning to juice or to blend so there are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=154.44s)]
*  some natural supplements that are completely pure organic that you can take as well if [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=159.56s)]
*  you don't have the time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  I personally like to take some as well and I have to include walnuts here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  Not necessarily because this is an immune booster but this is so good for your brain [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=169.12s)]
*  and cognitive health. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=173.56s)]
*  People say if you look at the walnuts they look like a little mini brain and they kind [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=175.08s)]
*  of do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=178.52s)]
*  It's kind of true. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=179.52s)]
*  I actually keep these with me in my office at the hospital. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=180.52s)]
*  They're really good for you so obviously you want to keep your body healthy but your brain [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=182.96s)]
*  healthy as well. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=186.36s)]
*  So these are organic and raw. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=187.36s)]
*  How important is it that it's organic versus not organic to you? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=188.86s)]
*  So unfortunately organic tends to be more expensive but it also means less chance of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=192.24s)]
*  being pesticides, less chance of there being hormones and other things added to them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=196.72s)]
*  So if you can get organic it's always the way to go. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=200.92s)]
*  If only we could get those prices down so that they're more affordable and accessible [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=204.48s)]
*  and I think that's a big part of the whole Make America Healthy Again movement. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=208.11999999999998s)]
*  A thousand percent and I just love that we're talking about it because I think natural as [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=211.32s)]
*  much as you can go. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=216.0s)]
*  By the way she does this, my daughter does this on Sunday nights and she does enough [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=217.0s)]
*  for like the next three or four days and then she starts again and I sometimes take some [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=220.56s)]
*  of it as well but you can do, you just have to think a little bit in advance. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=225.0s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=229.2s)]
*  So you know this about me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=230.2s)]
*  I have formulated some liquid herbs so turmeric, ginger, those can be very expensive and sometimes [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=231.2s)]
*  it is hard to get those so and oh I forgot about garlic. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  Oh my gosh it was hiding from me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=241.6s)]
*  Don't forget the garlic. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  Garlic is one of the best things for your immune system so I actually take liquid garlic, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  turmeric, ginger and all of these things because you want to try and prevent getting sick. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=248.56s)]
*  If your body is as healthy as possible going into cold and flu season, best bet of staying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=253.28s)]
*  healthy throughout the season. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=257.7s)]
*  These supplements, where can they get it? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=258.7s)]
*  Well you can find them anywhere, obviously fresh is best. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=260.4s)]
*  I personally use some that you can find on my social media. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=263.44s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=266.44s)]
*  Alright. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCIovLyqyY&t=267.44s)]
