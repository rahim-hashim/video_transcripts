# This is what ‘real leadership’ looks like: Karoline Leavitt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE)
*  I'm not thinking about voters right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about lives. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=8.44s)]
*  And to be honest, it's much bigger than anything else. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=10.0s)]
*  But we're thinking about lives, a lot of lives lost, a lot of people missing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'd be focused on right now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=18.36s)]
*  As former President Trump in Georgia yesterday, making his priorities clear while he surveyed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=21.16s)]
*  damage from Helene. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  Here to react is Trump 2024 National Press Secretary, Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=26.88s)]
*  Caroline, great to have you on the program. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=31.04s)]
*  I think that's a wonderful sentiment to hear from President Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=33.76s)]
*  I'm not worried about voters right now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=37.12s)]
*  The focus should be on lives in North Carolina. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=39.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=43.68s)]
*  North Carolina, Georgia, states across the country have had a devastating impact from [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=44.68s)]
*  Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=49.2s)]
*  And over the past week, President Trump has shown the world and the country what real [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  leadership looks like. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=54.96s)]
*  He has gone to Georgia twice to tour impacted areas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  He has received two local briefings, asked good questions of local officials. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=59.68s)]
*  What do they need? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=64.32s)]
*  How can he be helpful, even though he's not in the White House right now? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=65.32s)]
*  He has privately raised and donated more than $5 million through his GoFundMe page. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=69.2s)]
*  We're still encouraging our fellow Americans to chip in to help our fellow Americans, who [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=73.96s)]
*  the federal government has left behind. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=79.0s)]
*  Our motorcade was passing through Evans, Georgia yesterday, and I couldn't help but look out [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=81.72s)]
*  the window. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=84.96s)]
*  There were trees down everywhere. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=86.0s)]
*  Cars were smashed, homes still without electricity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=87.88s)]
*  Our fellow Americans on the sidewalk watching President Trump's motorcade come through, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=90.96s)]
*  a little bit of hope he was giving to them just by showing up, because our real leaders, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=96.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, are absent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=101.55999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris had the audacity to go to a microphone and to say that she's going to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=104.24s)]
*  give $750 to struggling Americans when we just gave another $6 billion to Ukraine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  Why can we only give $750? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=114.28s)]
*  Because Kamala Harris bankrupted FEMA, spent a billion dollars on illegal immigrants, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=115.72s)]
*  putting them up in luxury hotels, while our fellow Americans have been displaced from [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=120.68s)]
*  their homes from one of the worst hurricanes this country has ever seen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=125.6s)]
*  It's a dereliction of duty. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=129.36s)]
*  Our fellow Americans are struggling. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=131.0s)]
*  President Trump understands that, and he's going to continue to show up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=132.76s)]
*  You know, Caroline, you bring up that GoFundMe. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=135.64s)]
*  I know this set the original goal at $1 million. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=137.36s)]
*  It's already at $5 million. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  And I want to take a moment here to provide a fact check for Americans who might have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  been led astray. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=145.24s)]
*  There were some viral posts to suggest that the Trump campaign was only going to send [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=146.24s)]
*  3% to victims and keep the other 97%. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  I personally called GoFundMe earlier this week. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=155.24s)]
*  I said, that can't be true. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=157.84s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=159.28s)]
*  Luckily, after I did that as well, Reuters put out this fact check. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=160.28s)]
*  That's false. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=165.08s)]
*  That BS going around is false. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=166.08s)]
*  It says, posts online incorrectly said only 3% of donations via the website would reach [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  storm victims. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=173.0s)]
*  All proceeds minus a 3% transaction fee from the Trump authorized GoFundMe page will be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=174.4s)]
*  distributed to organizations supporting those impacted by Helene. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=180.2s)]
*  And Caroline, I know that's going to Samaritan's Purse and Water Mission. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=183.16s)]
*  And you're up to $5 million, 97% of which is going to help people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=187.72s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=194.2s)]
*  Every penny is going to go to victims on the ground in these impacted areas across the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=195.2s)]
*  country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=199.92s)]
*  Water Mission is a great organization we've already contributed to, as well as Samaritan's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=201.68s)]
*  Purse, who is delivering direct relief to those that their homes were destroyed, their [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=204.84s)]
*  cars were destroyed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=209.56s)]
*  They go out in the field on the ground and they actually help fix some of that damage. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=210.64s)]
*  And so, again, all of this money is going to go towards victims on the ground. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=215.6s)]
*  And it was President Trump's idea. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=219.72s)]
*  We left Georgia last Monday. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=221.14s)]
*  We went to Valdosta. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=222.36s)]
*  He received a briefing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=223.6s)]
*  He met with volunteers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=224.6s)]
*  He gave remarks to really shine a national spotlight on what was going on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=225.76s)]
*  On the plane ride home, he said to us, I want to do more. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  We need to help these people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  The government's not showing up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  They need money. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  They need resources. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  They need capital. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're doing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  It's good work. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  It's just, it's the right thing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  It's leadership. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=240.28s)]
*  By the way, Caroline, today in Butler, Pennsylvania, President Trump's going to go back less than [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=241.52s)]
*  three months since the attempted assassination. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  He will talk to what we on Fox and Friends see this morning looks like thousands and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  thousands of people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  What will his message be in Butler? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  Well, today is a solemn day for the country, for our campaign. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  President Trump is going back to Butler to honor the lives of the victims who were lost, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=261.24s)]
*  who were injured, to be with their families and to really just show the strength of these [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  families who lost their loved one, the family of Corey Namely and the other two gentlemen [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=270.9s)]
*  at that on that day who were injured. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=275.4s)]
*  And it really the fact that there are thousands of people already in Butler right now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=277.0s)]
*  I saw the lines behind Pete. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  It's so encouraging. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  The fact that Pennsylvanians are showing up at a place where President Trump came within [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=283.74s)]
*  millimeters of losing his life shows the resiliency, the strength, the determination of the American [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=287.58s)]
*  people. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=292.86s)]
*  And he will be there tonight with a message of unity, a message of strength, talking about [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=293.86s)]
*  how we're going to save this great country. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=298.38s)]
*  And again, it was just two months ago where he took a bullet for democracy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=300.3s)]
*  And we have a current vice president in Kamala Harris, a president in Joe Biden, who are [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=304.46000000000004s)]
*  threatening democracy every day with their wide open border invasion of this country, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=309.26s)]
*  with their weak foreign policy leading us to the brink of World War Three, with their [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=313.36s)]
*  terrible energy policy that has increased the cost of living in this country for all [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=316.7s)]
*  Americans working families in Pennsylvania and Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, every state. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=320.64s)]
*  Americans are struggling and President Trump's going to bring a sense of hope, of unity, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=325.64s)]
*  of resolve tonight that I think this country desperately needs. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=329.88s)]
*  Well, you got live pictures here of people lined up filing in there in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=332.56s)]
*  So we'll be watching. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=337.88s)]
*  Caroline, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=338.88s)]
*  We look forward to it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt_f72i8VfE&t=340.36s)]
