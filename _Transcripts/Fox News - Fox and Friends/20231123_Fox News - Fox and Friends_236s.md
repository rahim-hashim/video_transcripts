# US is on the verge of an Afghanistan-style mistake: Former ambassador
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA)
*  A Fox News alert, a live look at Gaza where Israeli forces are still striking Hamas terror [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=0.0s)]
*  hubs with a four-day ceasefire and release of 50 hostages delayed for at least another [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=6.76s)]
*  day, while both sides finalize what they say are logistics of the deal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=12.48s)]
*  Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Freeman joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=17.6s)]
*  Ambassador, I think a question on a lot of our minds is do, can we trust that Hamas will [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=21.32s)]
*  follow through with this and do we believe 50 hostages will be released in the next maybe [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=25.92s)]
*  48 hours? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=29.84s)]
*  Well, you certainly can't trust Hamas. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=30.84s)]
*  I mean, you saw what they did on October 7th. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=34.24s)]
*  Look, it's a culture of death. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=37.68s)]
*  I think they're enjoying the emotional blackmail that they're inflicting upon the families [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=39.68s)]
*  and the entire nation of Israel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=45.08s)]
*  So no, you can't trust them at all, but they're the ones who are holding the hostages, so [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=47.4s)]
*  you have to deal with them if you want to get the hostages back. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=53.0s)]
*  It's a heartbreaking process, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more delays right now because [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=56.28s)]
*  it's such an asymmetric discussion between Israel, Hamas and the interlocutors. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  We use that term asymmetric in warfare, talking about the difference between almost guerrilla [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=68.44s)]
*  tactics of our enemies on a home-field advantage versus a conventional military coming in. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=72.48s)]
*  But now you apply that to diplomacy, and I find that really interesting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=77.04s)]
*  I mean, you talk about Israel giving up 150 terrorists and presumably, I guess, their [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=81.44s)]
*  children that were born while they were prisoners to where they're giving back 50 hostages that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=84.84s)]
*  did nothing wrong. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=90.64s)]
*  So, and you talk about this idea of psychological warfare. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=91.64s)]
*  What is truly, it is terror. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=94.84s)]
*  But talk about the asymmetry of the diplomacy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=96.4s)]
*  Where does Israel go even after this four-day ceasefire to get the rest of those hostages [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=99.6s)]
*  back? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=103.6s)]
*  Well, Israel has a disadvantage because it's a, we like to say it's a country of Jewish [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=105.36s)]
*  mothers, you know, even the guys, you know, it's a country of Jewish mothers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=110.36s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  I lived there for seven years, and I feel the same way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, we can't sleep knowing that we have children, mothers, sisters, who are in harm's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=118.28s)]
*  way, who are being held under abominable conditions, and who knows where. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, it bothers us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=129.92s)]
*  It bothers us tremendously. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  It bothers the Israeli people, the whole nation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=132.76000000000002s)]
*  They want to get these people home. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas, you know, they train their kids to become suicide bombers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=136.44s)]
*  They don't care about any of this stuff. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, and they're going to hold, they're still going to hold 190 hostages if everything [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=141.08s)]
*  goes well, which gives them enormous capacity to continue to inflict pain, and they're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=146.12s)]
*  going to get a four or five-day ceasefire and limitations of Israeli surveillance. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Look, you know, objectively, it's a lousy deal. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=156.68s)]
*  But, you know, in terms of what Israel cares the most about, which is the lives of innocent [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=160.28s)]
*  civilians, it's what Israel needs to do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=165.24s)]
*  The real question, Joey, is what happens next, because if the pressure continues within the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=167.72s)]
*  Biden administration to handcuff Israel, if that continues and Israel is somehow restrained [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=174.12s)]
*  after this four or five-day ceasefire ends from finishing off Hamas, we're talking about [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=179.64s)]
*  a mistake by America of, you know, Afghanistan in proportions, you know, the idea. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=185.32s)]
*  If they keep Israel from finishing this job, not only will Israel be losing end to this war, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=191.16s)]
*  but all of us, all of us in the free world, including America, will signal that we're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=199.16s)]
*  in big trouble. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  And, Master, you answered my next question. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=205.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for your insight. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=207.64s)]
*  The diplomacy side of this is very interesting as we watch the war, way, John, and we see [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=209.24s)]
*  the lives lost. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=213.56s)]
*  And we just hope for a quick resolution, but we hope for a resolution that guarantees the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=214.68s)]
*  security of Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=218.84s)]
*  Ambassador Friedman, thank you for joining us. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=220.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=222.68s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=223.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=223.8s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBrdSxPauHA&t=224.12s)]
