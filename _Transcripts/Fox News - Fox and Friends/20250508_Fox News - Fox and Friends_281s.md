# NYPD arrests 80+ 'free Palestine' protesters who stormed Columbia library
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU)
*  Palestine will be free! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestine will be free! [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=3.0s)]
*  And there is only one solution! [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=5.0s)]
*  There is only one solution! [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=8.0s)]
*  It's the end of evolution! [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=10.0s)]
*  It's the end of evolution! [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=13.0s)]
*  So that was the scene and it was sickening at Columbia University yesterday at their library. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=15.0s)]
*  Over 100 anti-Israeli protesters stormed the Butler Library on campus in support of Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=20.0s)]
*  with over 80 being arrested. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=27.0s)]
*  The university responded by saying, quote, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=29.0s)]
*  disruptions to our academic activities will not be tolerated and are violations of our rules and policies. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=31.0s)]
*  This is especially unacceptable while our students study and prepare for final exams. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=37.0s)]
*  Eden Yadigar is a Columbia student that witnessed the protests. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=42.0s)]
*  She was studying, believe it or not, for finals on the first floor and she joins us now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=46.0s)]
*  Eden, what was it like for you as a Jewish student seeing this happen again right in front of you? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=51.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=56.0s)]
*  Like you said, I, along with hundreds, if not thousands of other students, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=58.0s)]
*  were just trying to study for finals and complete our coursework when dozens of masked vandals, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=62.0s)]
*  the vast majority of whom we believe are students, flooded into the library, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=68.0s)]
*  panting free Palestine, calling for an Intifada revolution, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=72.0s)]
*  and calling in Arabic for one state, one Palestinian state, from the river to the sea. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=76.0s)]
*  Not only was it absolutely shocking and interesting, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=81.0s)]
*  absolutely shocking and intimidating, but it was disrupting one of the most basic functions of the university. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=85.0s)]
*  And it's ridiculous to me that almost two years later, since October 7th, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=91.0s)]
*  since these sort of disruptions have become commonplace, that this happened during finals week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=96.0s)]
*  But it does mark a pretty notable shift in how Columbia handled it, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=102.0s)]
*  because Columbia brought in the NYPD within four hours to arrest these students. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=106.0s)]
*  And I am cautiously optimistic that they will be held accountable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=111.0s)]
*  Every single one of them should be expelled, if not, you know, expelled immediately, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=115.0s)]
*  because they forced the evacuation of the library. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=120.0s)]
*  Students were trying to study, and we weren't able to do that, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=123.0s)]
*  because of this small group of radical anti-Israeli, anti-Jewish vandals. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=126.0s)]
*  We're about to find out how many are students. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=131.0s)]
*  And with the security you tell me should be saluted, because some got beat up, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=134.0s)]
*  and some got hurt, and they stood there. But why did it take five hours for the NYPD to come? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=139.0s)]
*  What was the issue there? I'm sure the NYPD could have been there sooner. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=144.0s)]
*  It's a great question. That's what I'm wondering as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=149.0s)]
*  In comparison to timelines we've seen in the past with last year's building occupation of Hamilton Hall, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=152.0s)]
*  with the encampment, this was record speed for Columbia. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=158.0s)]
*  And, you know, I really appreciate that, because it means that we were able to go back to normal campus life, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=161.0s)]
*  back to studying sooner, but it is ridiculous that accountability is as difficult as it is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=167.0s)]
*  After these protesters stormed into this room, the main reading room in Butler Library, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=174.0s)]
*  public safety demanded that they show identification, show their Columbia ID, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=179.0s)]
*  and then they would simply be able to leave. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=184.0s)]
*  And these protesters ended up claiming that they were being held hostage by public safety, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=187.0s)]
*  because they refused to identify themselves, which is not only just ridiculous and completely opposed to common sense, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=192.0s)]
*  but also unbelievable to me that they would make a mockery of the fact that there are 59 hostages currently being held [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=199.0s)]
*  by the very terrorist group, Hamas, that they are praising, including an American 21-year-old who is believed to be alive, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=206.0s)]
*  Edan Alexander. It is ridiculous that we are even having to focus on this group of ignorant, bigoted kids that are disrupting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=212.0s)]
*  everyone else's studying and finals week, and it's taking away attention from what matters most, which is getting our hostages home. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=221.0s)]
*  Edan, I'd love for all of them to be expelled. I don't care if they're going to graduate in two weeks. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=230.0s)]
*  They should be told you're not graduating from Columbia. And they came out and said this is the reason they did it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=234.0s)]
*  As long as Columbia bolsters the violence of empire, we will disrupt your peace and shatter your notions of control if you escalate repression. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. They're going to cost their school $400 million because it's been frozen by the federal government. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=249.0s)]
*  And your parents must be so proud of you to wear the Jewish star so they know exactly what religion you are. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=255.0s)]
*  And you're going to study through it and you're going to get a degree and they're going to have their ridiculous lives to lead. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=261.0s)]
*  Thanks so much, Edan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=266.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=268.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=269.0s)]
*  Thank you, Edan. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXqXHXuhrU&t=279.0s)]
