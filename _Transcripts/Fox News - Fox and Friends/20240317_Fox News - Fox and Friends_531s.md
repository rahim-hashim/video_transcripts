# ‘WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE’: Netanyahu blasts Schumer over calls for new Israeli leadership
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8)
*  Right now in Qatar, a country playing a lot of double games these days, ceasefire negotiations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=0.0s)]
*  set to resume between Israel and Hamas as Israel still fights to defend itself from [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=7.88s)]
*  the brutal military attack on their country when more than 1200 Israelis were murdered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=13.68s)]
*  And still Hamas holds more than 100 hostage. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=20.04s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joins us live from Jerusalem with an update. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=24.2s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=29.0s)]
*  Calls for a ceasefire at this point are extortion. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=33.16s)]
*  The other on behalf of Hamas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=36.12s)]
*  But you've been in the press talking a lot about the offensive in Ra'afah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=38.88s)]
*  How does that play into getting Hamas to a place where they're prepared to negotiate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=42.76s)]
*  on your terms? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=47.5s)]
*  Look, the only thing that gets Hamas to release the hostages is continued military pressure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=49.08s)]
*  That's what enabled us to bring out already half of the hostages. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=56.8s)]
*  That's what will enable us to get the remaining hostages. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=60.44s)]
*  At the same time, there has to be pressure, pressure from Qatar that wields enormous influence [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=62.76s)]
*  on Hamas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=67.2s)]
*  And they should be pressed to press them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=69.3s)]
*  So the fact that we're going to destroy the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions in Ra'afah [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=71.28s)]
*  is both important for eradicating the Hamas rule, but also important for getting the hostages [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=84.2s)]
*  These are complementary goals. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=85.3s)]
*  They're not contradictory goals. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=86.8s)]
*  How many Hamas fighters, terrorists remain in Ra'afah? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=88.62s)]
*  What kind of force are we talking about? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  We've, Pete, we've destroyed about 19 of Hamas 24 terrorist battalions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=93.42s)]
*  So there are about four in Ra'afah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=100.96s)]
*  We have to destroy them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=103.06s)]
*  When people tell us don't go into Ra'afah, that's like telling the allies, listen, don't [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  go into Berlin, leave a quarter of the Nazi army intact. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=108.7s)]
*  You know, that's, that's ridiculous. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=112.38s)]
*  You know, if we leave a quarter of the Hamas fighting terrorist battalions in place, they'll [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=113.46s)]
*  regroup, reconquer Gaza, and in fact perpetrate once again what they vowed to do, which is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=120.46s)]
*  to repeat the October 7th massacre over and over and over again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=125.94s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=130.18s)]
*  So we need total victory over Hamas. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=131.18s)]
*  We're within reach. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=133.78s)]
*  We should do it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=135.3s)]
*  We're going to do it while we enable the civilian population in Ra'afah to leave, as we've done [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=136.3s)]
*  up to now, but we have to finish the job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=141.9s)]
*  We need total victory. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=144.1s)]
*  There's no substitute for total victory. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=145.82s)]
*  There's no doubt this is a fight that Israel needs to finish considering what occurred. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=147.98s)]
*  Yet you already hear in our media and from our leadership, we're going to get to that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=152.7s)]
*  in a moment, renewed calls again for a two state solution. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=155.38s)]
*  What's your view on these calls for a Palestinian state? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=159.62s)]
*  Well, it's not only, it's not only my view, it's the view of the vast majority of Israelis [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=163.34s)]
*  who believe that at this time to have a Palestinian state would be basically a formula for creating [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=169.26s)]
*  a platform, the greatest reward for terrorism in history, and it would create a platform [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  for attacking Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  In fact, Hamas had a de facto Palestinian state in Gaza, and what did they use it for? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  To massacre Israelis and the worst savagery that was meted on Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  So we just had a vote in the Knesset the other day. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=195.74s)]
*  Ninety-nine against nine of the Knesset, our parliament members, voted against the attempt [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=199.22s)]
*  to impose on Israel a Palestinian state. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  You have to say when people say, oh, well, this is Netanyahu and his fringe elements [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=209.58s)]
*  in his coalition, no, it's not. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=215.44s)]
*  It's the vast majority of the Israeli public that understands that a Palestinian state, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=217.56s)]
*  being envisioned, would be an enormous danger to Israel's future. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=222.94s)]
*  So that's why they're united in resisting this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=226.98s)]
*  And it's, I'm proud to lead this policy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=229.74s)]
*  But when I'm being criticized by various people in the United States as obstructing peace [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=232.26s)]
*  because of that, well, number one, we're not obstructing peace. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=237.46s)]
*  We're ensuring that we don't have a catastrophic suicidal move. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=240.68s)]
*  And second, it's not just me, it's the vast majority of Israelis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=244.1s)]
*  So if you want to take up the issue with a vast majority of Israelis, say so. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=247.98s)]
*  Say you're against the vast majority of the people of Israel and don't try to personalize [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=251.98s)]
*  it because it's not a personal thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=256.14s)]
*  I'm leading the policy that most Israelis think is essential for our survival in our [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  future. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=262.02s)]
*  Let's talk about that criticism, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=263.02s)]
*  Here's Chuck Schumer slamming you on the Senate floor on Thursday. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  A new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=270.7s)]
*  about the future of Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=278.06s)]
*  People on all sides of this war are turning away from a two-state solution, including [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=279.46s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=284.62s)]
*  I believe in his heart he has his highest priority is as is the security of Israel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=287.06s)]
*  However, I also believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=294.06s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, he says you've got to go. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=300.46s)]
*  Joe Biden says he liked the speech and also said your policies are hurting Israel more [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  than helping Israel. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=308.52s)]
*  Your response to Chuck Schumer and the president? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=310.02s)]
*  I think Schumer's statements are wholly inappropriate. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  I think we're not a banana republic. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=317.41999999999996s)]
*  The people of Israel will choose when they'll have elections, who they'll elect, and it's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=319.46s)]
*  not something that will be foisted upon us. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=323.26s)]
*  It's wrong to try to replace the elected leaders of a sister democracy and a staunch American [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=326.73999999999995s)]
*  ally at any time, but especially during the time of war. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=332.58s)]
*  Just imagine that after 9-11 and when you're in the midst of fighting al-Qaeda and winning, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=335.94s)]
*  people will say, oh, well, the right thing people, some Israeli would say, oh, the right [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=342.3s)]
*  thing to do is not to have new elections in America or have President Bush resign. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=346.46s)]
*  It's inappropriate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=351.86s)]
*  It shouldn't have been said. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=352.86s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=354.06s)]
*  As far as my considerations, they're not for my personal survival. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=355.06s)]
*  They are for the survival of the Jewish state. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=358.9s)]
*  And that requires pursuing the war. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=362.62s)]
*  It's something that's support that my government enjoys the support of the overwhelming majority [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  of Israelis. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=370.1s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=371.1s)]
*  Not only the majority of Israelis, but the majority of the American people, 82 percent [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=372.1s)]
*  support Israel consistently over the five months of the war against Hamas and not Hamas. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=377.1s)]
*  So I don't know why Senator Schumer made those statements. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=383.5s)]
*  I think the only thing that we should be focused on is changing the regime in Gaza, bringing [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=388.54s)]
*  down the terrorist regime of Hamas and not the duly elected government of Israel. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=394.26s)]
*  That's the right policy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, as you know, Donald Trump is the frontrunner on the Republican side. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  He was recently asked about what Joe Biden has said on this topic. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=407.5s)]
*  And all of a sudden he dumped Israel. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=409.54s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  He dumped Israel. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, he's not walking away, but what would be in light of... [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=414.94s)]
*  But wouldn't you say he is walking away? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=415.94s)]
*  I mean, he just said essentially that Bibi Netanyahu should take a walk. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=417.1s)]
*  Do you feel like you're losing support, Mr. Prime Minister? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=422.86s)]
*  Well, I hope not. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=425.06s)]
*  First of all, let me say that I appreciate President Trump's tremendous support for Israel. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=428.06s)]
*  When he was president, he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=432.82s)]
*  He moved the American embassy there. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=436.26s)]
*  He recognized our sovereignty in the Golan Heights. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=438.7s)]
*  He got out of the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=441.1s)]
*  And he also, together, we worked and brokered the historic Abraham Accords, which brought [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=444.5s)]
*  peace with four Arab states. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=449.5s)]
*  Equally, I appreciate the fact that right from the start of the war, President Biden [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=451.41999999999996s)]
*  stood with Israel, came here, called Hamas sheer evil, sent carrier groups, aircraft [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=456.58s)]
*  carrier groups to the region, and sent us ammunition. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=462.14s)]
*  So I hope that support will continue. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=464.78s)]
*  But I'll tell you one thing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=466.94s)]
*  Look, you know, I can tell you, and I said this to President Biden early on, we had our [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=467.94s)]
*  discussions, we had some differences on whether we should enter Gaza, how we should enter [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=473.86s)]
*  Gaza and so on. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=477.3s)]
*  And I said the truth. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=478.7s)]
*  I said, look, if we have to go it alone, we'll go it alone. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  But I also know that we're not alone, that the vast majority of Americans support Israel. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=485.7s)]
*  And for a good reason, because they understand that our war is your war. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=490.94s)]
*  Our victory is your victory. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  That we're fighting the same people who want to chant death to America and death to Israel. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=497.26s)]
*  They want to see our civilization brought down, our liberties brought down, our values [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=502.3s)]
*  brought down. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=506.62s)]
*  And that's why I think we'll continue to enjoy the support of the vast majority of the American [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=507.62s)]
*  public. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=512.1s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, thank you for joining us on Fox and Friends Weekend. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=513.58s)]
*  Godspeed in your fight, sir. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=516.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=518.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqwc7IOfgH8&t=520.06s)]
