# Texas man clung to meter box for hours to survive deadly flooding
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8)
*  So this morning more miracle stories of survival like our next guest who was forced to swim [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=0.0s)]
*  through a window and survive by clinging to a meter box for hours until help arrived. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=9.36s)]
*  That Texas Blood survivor, Kristen Thill, has been kind enough to join us right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=15.52s)]
*  Kristen, I'm so glad that you're with us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=19.68s)]
*  Explain to us exactly what happened. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=22.68s)]
*  So yeah, I went to bed at around 1 a.m. and a couple hours later at 3 a.m. I wake up to the sound of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=25.48s)]
*  thunder outside. You know, I don't really think too much of it. I just roll over and try to go [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=33.4s)]
*  back to sleep and I start hearing these really strange noises coming from deeper in the house [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=38.24s)]
*  and originally I thought someone broke into the house. So I get up and I swing my feet over the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  side of the bed and that's when I realized I was standing in water up to my ankle. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=51.48s)]
*  No way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  And so I start to make my way into the dining room and I'm looking around and I see the wooden deck [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  that used to be there was just completely ripped up and there's water flowing in from the floor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=64.4s)]
*  And you know, that's of course when I call my mom and call my dad and he told me to try and get to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=70.72s)]
*  my truck and go to my aunt's house. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=76.56s)]
*  So you were there alone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=78.2s)]
*  Mm-hmm. And I grab my keys off of the dining room table and I start making my way towards the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=79.68s)]
*  kitchen and I can't see outside. It's pitch black and the water level was higher outside. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=87.68s)]
*  So I tried. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=94.4s)]
*  How high was the water? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=95.12s)]
*  At this point it was probably at my knees. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  At your knees at this point. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=98.56s)]
*  And then I try to open the door and just a wall of water starts rushing in at me [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=99.76s)]
*  and that brought it up to probably about my waist. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=105.92s)]
*  And I retreat. I try to go back to my bedroom and by this point there's furniture floating [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=109.04s)]
*  and I'm having to crawl over it to get through the doorways. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=116.4s)]
*  And I finally get back to the bedroom and I try to throw all my belongings onto the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  air mattress because it's floating. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=126.4s)]
*  And there's a wooden by this point the air mattress was like well above my head so I [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=129.2s)]
*  couldn't climb onto it. So I was trying to climb onto a wooden dresser to get onto the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=134.88s)]
*  air mattress but that just kept rotating and tumbling underneath me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=139.6s)]
*  And I was on the phone with 911 and I just kind of realized they couldn't really do anything for me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=145.68s)]
*  And that's kind of when I realized I had to save myself or keep myself alive until they could come [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=153.44s)]
*  and rescue me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=161.6s)]
*  What's going through your head during this moment is every single scenario that you try to readjust [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=162.72s)]
*  to it doesn't work. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=168.88s)]
*  Yeah it's just it was crazy. I don't know how I made any decision that I did. I just [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=171.12s)]
*  I tried to open another door and that wouldn't buzz and then I just kind of saw the window was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=178.64s)]
*  broken and that was just kind of a light bulb moment and I had nowhere else to go. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=184.24s)]
*  I realized I couldn't just sit there and swim for three or four hours until the water [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=188.72s)]
*  went away or someone came to save me so I went outside and just held on to the side of the building. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=194.64s)]
*  Did you think at one point that it's almost over? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=203.44s)]
*  Yeah a couple times. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=206.72s)]
*  Who do you credit for you being here today with us? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=209.12s)]
*  God. I think that's pretty much it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=212.24s)]
*  When you finally got to see your mom and dad what did you tell them? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  I got a crazy story to tell y'all. It was like unbelievable like I don't really know if I believe [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=222.16s)]
*  it just yet. We're glad you're here with us brother. We appreciate you coming on the program to tell [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=229.36s)]
*  your story. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=235.68s)]
*  you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu11JhckUU8&t=246.24s)]
