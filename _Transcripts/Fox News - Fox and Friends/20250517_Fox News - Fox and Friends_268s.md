# Former FBI agent who worked under Comey says he had ‘narcissistic tendencies’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4)
*  for more on the New Orleans jail break let's bring in former FBI special agent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=0.0s)]
*  and Fox News contributor Nicole Parker. Nicole welcome. Hi thank you for having [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=4.88s)]
*  me. So this scenario in New Orleans 10 prisoners breaking out what do you make [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=9.4s)]
*  of it? How does that happen? That's absolutely unbelievable and that's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=15.48s)]
*  terrifying to the citizens of that area and I can tell you that I am friends [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=20.46s)]
*  with agents that were in the FBI in New Orleans and it wouldn't shock me if it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  was an inside job and that assistance was provided to these inmates. I mean [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=28.84s)]
*  these are not just your run-of-the-mill criminals these are people that have [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=32.64s)]
*  been convicted of murder and are you know alleged to have committed murder [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=36.4s)]
*  and this is very very dangerous and it's very important for the citizens in that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=40.72s)]
*  area to know that they are considered armed and dangerous. If you see them you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=44.6s)]
*  need to report it immediately to law enforcement but to stay safe. Former FBI [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=48.28s)]
*  director James Comey created quite a stir on social media this week. I want to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=52.72s)]
*  play President Trump's reaction to it and then I'll get your analysis of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=57.4s)]
*  whole thing. He knew exactly what that meant. The child knows what that meant. If [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=61.36s)]
*  you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant that meant [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=67.4s)]
*  assassination and it says it loud and clear. Now he wasn't very competent but [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=72.48s)]
*  he was competent enough to know what that meant. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=80.52s)]
*  Nicole as a former FBI special agent what's your reaction to all this? First [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=84.04s)]
*  of all he is a former FBI director. He should be held to a higher standard and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=90.24s)]
*  he should know what those numbers mean and for him to say that he did not I do [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=95.16s)]
*  not believe that he is being honest and truthful. I believe that there is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=99.32s)]
*  definitely deniability in this in this situation. I think the US Secret Service [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=102.12s)]
*  going in and conducting the interviews if I was the investigating agent the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=106.56s)]
*  first question I would say why did you post that and what did you think it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=109.8s)]
*  meant? If you didn't think it meant violence what did you think it meant? And [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=114.64s)]
*  I think looking at the pattern of his posts on Instagram I know I looked [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=117.92s)]
*  through his Instagram page myself there there's some serious bitterness and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  disdain towards President Trump in this new administration and it appears that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=125.28s)]
*  Jim Comey is very concerned about you know the situation that our country is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=128.92s)]
*  in right now and you know telling those at DOJ and FBI to hold the line and you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  know I can tell you right now as a former FBI agent who worked when he was [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=136.44s)]
*  the director I believe and many agents believe that he is the one that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=139.32s)]
*  politically weaponized the FBI. He was the beginning of the downfall at the FBI [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=144.0s)]
*  and the fact that he was fired Comey is still bitter towards President Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=148.92s)]
*  about that. He cannot get over it he cannot let it go and he believes that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=153.28s)]
*  Trump destroyed his legacy and so for him to say this post was just you know [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=156.72s)]
*  walking along a beach and seeing seashells I'm not buying that. Here is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=160.68s)]
*  Comey's explanation I want to show the audience and I'll get you to react to it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  he said quote I posted a picture earlier of some shells I saw on a beach [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=169.0s)]
*  walk which I assumed were a political message I didn't realize some folks [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=172.48s)]
*  associate those numbers with violence it never occurred to me but I opposed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=176.36s)]
*  violence of any kind so I took the post down. Final thought on this matter. Again [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=180.6s)]
*  I'm sorry but I think Jim Comey knows better than that and and I just don't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=187.0s)]
*  think Americans we just don't believe that and again as a former FBI agent who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=191.48s)]
*  I believe that he has narcissistic tendencies was quite arrogant quite [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=195.88s)]
*  manipulative and has never been held accountable. All right current FBI [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=200.24s)]
*  director Cash Patel creating quite a stir saying he's going to basically move [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=204.04s)]
*  around 1,500 FBI agents assigned here to Washington and close the headquarters [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=208.12s)]
*  your thoughts on that one. I think that's amazing because you know what the more [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=213.36s)]
*  people that are on the streets working cases the more people you're gonna put [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=217.6s)]
*  behind bars and that's what we want we want to make America safe again pushing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=220.76s)]
*  papers and doing it administrative work out of the Washington headquarters is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=224.84s)]
*  not is not going to make Americans safer and as an FBI agent I know that I was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=230.08s)]
*  overwhelmed with work and with cases and then we'd see people at headquarters [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=233.84s)]
*  who seem to be sitting there not not doing much and so I think it's a welcome [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=237.4s)]
*  welcome to the FBI that Cash Patel is saying look we're gonna put the you know [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=241.32s)]
*  good agents on the streets we're gonna let good cops be good cops and let's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=245.8s)]
*  put bad people behind bars that's what Americans want. After all not all the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=248.84s)]
*  crime happens here in the nation's capital Nicole Parker great to have you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022cc7gfyG4&t=252.24s)]
