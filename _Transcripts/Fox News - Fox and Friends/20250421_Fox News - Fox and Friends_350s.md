# Trump willing to 'turn up the heat' with Russia for Ukraine deal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY)
*  So right now Vice President JD Vance is on a four-day trip to India where he'll meet with the India [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=0.0s)]
*  Prime Minister of the economy trade and geopolitical ties. It's big because you know [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=5.28s)]
*  We're looking for in trade it comes as one Wall Street Journal editor suggests [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=10.08s)]
*  India could be poised to take a bigger role in US trade amid Trump's tariffs on China [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Hudson Institute senior fellow and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=19.68s)]
*  Foreign policy expert Rebecca Heinrich joins us now Rebecca [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  This is interesting for him to go right to India and then talk trade immediately [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=25.88s)]
*  24 hours after China is warning other countries not to make deals with us [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=31.16s)]
*  Right India is going to be one of our key [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=37.88s)]
*  Partners India is a key partner for for the United States to counter China [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=40.6s)]
*  Just the stronger India is the closer we collaborate yes on trade [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=45.2s)]
*  But also as we collaborate militarily through the AUKUS arrangement with the Australians [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=49.32s)]
*  That's going to be really good to slow China's aspirations to act aggressively throughout the region [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=53.92s)]
*  Note that as President Trump has conducted these these tariffs and now has a pause on our key allies and partners [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  China's been going on this charm offensive to try to get these other countries not to work with the United States [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  But to instead work with China so very important to see Vice President Vance go to India to make sure that they are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=71.44s)]
*  Collaborating talking and looking to make deals and there's a big imbalance between the two nations judging by like the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=78.08s)]
*  The strength and depth of the economy in India have potential so there things are weighted against us so to speak and we are looking [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=84.2s)]
*  To move manufacturing some bit more logical to go from China to India more than it is to go from China to America [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right, so we want to get key things that that are really crucial for American sovereignty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=100.64s)]
*  There's certain things that we only want to make in the United States [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=106.44s)]
*  But then there are other things that are perfectly good to make and keep partners with stable places that are reliable [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=109.0s)]
*  India is a great one obviously the European markets another great one for reshoring [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  But India and they have a huge high skilled workforce so we think of semiconductors and other key manufacturing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=119.48s)]
*  There's lots of engineers in India so Vice President Vance will certainly have some of those ideas in mind [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=126.58s)]
*  Some key things that he would want to move out of China and move into India [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=132.0s)]
*  So let's talk about Ukraine if we can and we know on Friday Secretary of State Rubio kind of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=135.3s)]
*  stunned people when he said we're getting tired of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=140.78s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine not getting closer to peace if this does it we don't show more [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=144.34s)]
*  Give on both sides. Maybe I'm just gonna walk away. I think that was a tactic [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=149.22s)]
*  What do you think because then Vladimir Putin came out and said let's just do an Easter ceasefire which he repeatedly broke [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=154.06s)]
*  That's right, I think President Trump is still negotiating mode [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=161.62s)]
*  I think he's showing that listen like this could go a bunch of different directions Russia has to make a decision [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=164.5s)]
*  I think it was a PR stunt that Vladimir Putin made to have a ceasefire over Easter [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=170.38s)]
*  There was no ceasefire even though the tempo may have slowed Russia continued its assault against Ukraine Ukraine defended itself [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=174.94s)]
*  And so I think Putin is now saying wait a second don't walk away because Vladimir Putin understands that he cannot keep [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=181.34s)]
*  He's gonna have to make a deal and he's testing to see where those lines are with the United States and also with Ukraine [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=187.34s)]
*  Rebecca I think one of the big lures that Russia could have is you have a president who said you stop this war [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=193.34s)]
*  We go to agree to a ceasefire and let's start trading right away [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=199.1s)]
*  You know get you off the you know, you're banned from the Swift's financial system. We're not dealing with you at all. So [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=202.3s)]
*  Start opening up trade so you can get a quick rehab on your economy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=209.1s)]
*  No other president would have given them that opportunity [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=213.17999999999998s)]
*  But yet Vladimir Putin doesn't seem to understand the opportunity that he has what am I and what am I misunderstanding? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  No, I think that's right [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=223.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean the thing I think that drives a lot of traditional foreign policy experts kind of nuts about President Trump is he's very non-emotional [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=224.54s)]
*  Non-ideological when it comes to these foreign policy crises [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=231.33999999999997s)]
*  He's perfectly perfectly willing to extend a hand to immediately get a deal with the United States [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=234.62s)]
*  Perfectly willing to extend a hand to immediately get back to resetting relations with authoritarian countries if they change their behavior [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=240.06s)]
*  He's also perfectly willing to go the other direction and really turn up the heat [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=247.58s)]
*  Against these countries that they're not willing to negotiate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=251.74s)]
*  And so Vladimir Putin need to understand that this is going to be the best deal he has with this administration [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  And the united states can still crank up sanctions and we still can work with the europeans to increase defense production [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=258.14s)]
*  To get more weapons into ukraine so that ukraine can have its own domestic capability and continue defending itself [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=264.86s)]
*  So Putin is going to have to make a decision and understand that this is not going to go on forever [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=270.46s)]
*  I just hope jd vance slips in india stop buying russian oil or level off on it because [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=274.94s)]
*  They're buying the discounted oil trump put on truth social. Hopefully russian ukraine will make a deal this week [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=280.46s)]
*  Both will then start to do big business with the united states of america and real quick [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=285.98s)]
*  We understand we're getting close to a rare earth deal more important than ever now that china's holding back [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=290.3s)]
*  On rare earth that we need for our bombs and for our computers [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  President trump understands that rare earth is what the united states needs to be able to compete with the chinese communist party [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  And so we need those rare earths in ukraine and to have the united states come really in concrete terms [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=308.62s)]
*  Have an interest in the security the sovereignty and the freedom of ukraine is critical [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=314.62s)]
*  And I think this rare earth deal is going to be essential for that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=318.7s)]
*  And also give ukrainians confidence that we're going to stick with them and make sure that they are secure free and sovereign [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=322.46s)]
*  All right rebecca. It's a tenuous time [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIJ-AJ53LY&t=327.18s)]
