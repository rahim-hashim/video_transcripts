**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw)
*  The National Weather Service did send out notifications, gave as much time as they could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=0.0s)]
*  with the tools that they have. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=4.46s)]
*  And we actually had staff on the ground that was more than would have been in the past [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  because of the holiday mutation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=11.28s)]
*  But, frankly, the National Weather Service under President Trump has been working to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=12.88s)]
*  put in new technology and a new system because it's been neglected for years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=16.96s)]
*  It's an ancient system that needed to be upgraded. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=20.28s)]
*  And so President Trump recognized that right away and got to work on it when he came into [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=22.98s)]
*  office in January. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=26.52s)]
*  But that installation is not complete and that technology isn't fully installed, but [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=28.4s)]
*  the alerts went out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=32.88s)]
*  We can continue to learn from every single situation, but know that during these times [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=34.48s)]
*  when we are trying to help people heal from situations like this, the best thing to do [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=39.56s)]
*  is to look and see how we can help and how we can walk along by people and get them some [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=44.3s)]
*  relief. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=49.08s)]
*  Make sure that we're doing all that we can to be more proactive in the future, but get [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=50.6s)]
*  through this terrible time right now as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV2GYwkDWw&t=53.92s)]
