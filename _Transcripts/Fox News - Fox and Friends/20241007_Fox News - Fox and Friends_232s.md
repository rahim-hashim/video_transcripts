# Man's son killed, other wounded in battles with Hamas
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA)
*  Now 28 minutes before the top of the hour, let's continue this story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas is still holding the body of Daniel Perez, who was killed that day protecting [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=3.64s)]
*  the kibbutz of Nael Ho'oz. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=7.8s)]
*  Daniel's father, Rabbi Doran Perez, joins me now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=10.76s)]
*  Rabbi, great to see you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=13.68s)]
*  Would have told your family paid on that day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Bring us through it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=19.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we have four children, two sons and two daughters. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=20.2s)]
*  Our sons are the older two. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=24.04s)]
*  We moved to Israel from South Africa 10 years ago. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=26.12s)]
*  Our sons were then 13 and 15 and fast forward to October 7th, 22 and 24. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=29.36s)]
*  Both officers in the Israeli army, our oldest son in the paratroopers and our youngest son, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=34.8s)]
*  Daniel, our oldest son, Jonathan, our youngest son, Daniel, in the tank corps. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Comes October 7th, Daniel is based with his tank crew outside a base called Nael Ho'oz, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  as you said, next to a kibbutz of many hundreds of people, Nael Ho'oz. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  He fought for two and a quarter hours valiantly and gallantly with his crew, saving so many [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  people, killing many terrorists until unfortunately he was shot, killed and taken hostage. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=57.8s)]
*  We only knew, Brian, after 163 days that he in fact had been killed based on evidence [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=62.64s)]
*  you spoke about. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=67.36s)]
*  So he was alive when they took him? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=68.36s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=70.08s)]
*  I think by the time 12 noon came that afternoon, 163 days later, we got video footage which [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=71.08s)]
*  confirmed unfortunately that he'd been killed that day. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=77.36s)]
*  So it seems that in that encounter he was killed and probably dragged dead across the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=80.28s)]
*  border. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=83.44s)]
*  Our other son, I just noticed the time, it's 7.30 in the morning here, it's 2.30 in Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=84.44s)]
*  Exactly at this time, 2.30, our oldest son, Jonathan, was fighting in the same base. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=89.64s)]
*  It just happened to be that he came when he heard what was going on at 8 o'clock in the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=94.84s)]
*  morning, he came to fight as well. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  He fought in six different places and in the same base, it just worked out that he was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=100.0s)]
*  there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=103.68s)]
*  He managed with his officers to save 22 soldiers, mainly female. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=104.68s)]
*  And he himself in that base at around this time got shot in the leg and by the grace [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=108.92s)]
*  of God was only injured. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=113.28s)]
*  It went in and out of his thigh. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=114.48s)]
*  It didn't affect his main artery. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  And by the end of the day, we had one son missing and another son lying in Beresheva [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=118.36s)]
*  Serok Hospital shot through the thigh. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=123.04s)]
*  And when you see those protesters in New York that are called to action today and you've [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  seen them, what are your thoughts? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=129.2s)]
*  I just can't believe the moral perversion in the world. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=131.6s)]
*  We're talking today. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=134.04s)]
*  Today is the 7th of October, the day that Hamas, according to any human standard, came [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=135.04s)]
*  in and an invasion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=139.28s)]
*  When Mike Pence visited Israel, I had the opportunity to meet him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=141.04s)]
*  He said, Doron, I understood this wasn't an infiltration. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  It was an invasion in 90 places with thousands and thousands of terrorists and killing, maiming, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=146.16s)]
*  burning, raping and then taking 250 hostages. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=153.16s)]
*  This should be a political issue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=156.72s)]
*  Is there nothing about politics and ideology, which is straight human morality? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=158.32s)]
*  It just boggles the mind. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=161.68s)]
*  You're going to give that message at the UN a little bit later, but and you have some [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=162.68s)]
*  pictures in your lap. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=165.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're almost out of time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=166.44s)]
*  Just show us something that you want everyone at home to see. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=167.44s)]
*  I just want to see that these are some of the hostages. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=170.24s)]
*  This is my son, Daniel, along with the Romeo, become very friendly with both still held [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=172.08s)]
*  by Hamas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=176.16s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=177.16s)]
*  Here we have a Bibus family, Brian, an entire family taken hostage. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=178.16s)]
*  Nine months old, Kfir. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  He was nine months when he was taken. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  He's been longer in captivity. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=186.0s)]
*  If he's alive, then he has been in freedom. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=187.0s)]
*  It's under the whole Bibus family. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Here we have a Muslim who was killed in captivity as well for the Israeli army. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=191.24s)]
*  An old man who is 85, just the oldest person. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=196.0s)]
*  He's a great grandfather. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=199.56s)]
*  And look at this, the final one. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=200.88s)]
*  Here are seven girls being held. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=202.6s)]
*  This is from Hamas' psychological warfare. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=204.3s)]
*  Releasing these pictures to show what the people are going through is just unbelievable. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  101 hostages one year later. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=210.68s)]
*  Where is the basic humanity which comes along and says, unconditionally, every single one [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  of these hostages need to be dead out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  We dare not pay ransom and reward horrific hostage taking. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=219.76s)]
*  Your composure and ability to tell the story that's so personal was fantastic. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=223.84s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=229.32s)]
*  Appreciate you going through this and keeping the message. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xQGgaSv9KA&t=230.32s)]
