# Trump can 'absolutely' reopen Alcatraz, says ex-military lawyer
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30)
*  So President Trump doubling down on his promise to make America safe again, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=0.0s)]
*  ordering the Bureau of Prison, DOJ, and Homeland Security to reopen Alcatraz. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=4.0s)]
*  To house, quote, America's most ruthless and violent offenders here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=10.0s)]
*  He is explaining that decision. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=16.0s)]
*  Just an idea I've had, and I guess because the judges, so many of these radicalized judges, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=19.0s)]
*  they want to have trials for every single, think of it, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=25.0s)]
*  every single person that's in our country illegally that came in illegally, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=28.0s)]
*  that would mean millions of trials, and it's just so ridiculous what's happening. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=32.0s)]
*  And it's long been a symbol, Alcatraz. It's a symbol of law and order. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=37.0s)]
*  All right, so our next list says this is exactly what America voted for. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=43.0s)]
*  Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army, Van Hip, joins us now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=47.0s)]
*  So, Van, I guess the question is, can the president reopen it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=50.0s)]
*  Absolutely, and for those folks who are complaining, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=53.0s)]
*  it's going to cost too much, it's going to be too difficult to do from a construction standpoint. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=56.0s)]
*  We've had a builder in this country, the best builder in America for years and years [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=61.0s)]
*  in the commercial sector is a guy by the name of Donald Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=65.0s)]
*  I think he can give, if they try to slow roll this, and bureaucrats try to do what they like to do, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=68.0s)]
*  I think the president can give them all the advice they need on how to reopen Alcatraz the right way. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=74.0s)]
*  So, Van, why do we need this? Is it because of all the criminals roaming the street, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=79.0s)]
*  this reimagining the criminal justice system? What's the need? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=85.0s)]
*  This is what the American people voted for, Lawrence. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=90.0s)]
*  They're tired of thugs and gangs roaming rampant on our city streets. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=92.0s)]
*  They're tired of murderers and terrorists coming across our border. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=97.0s)]
*  And sometimes we forget why we have a federal government. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=100.0s)]
*  The states came together to provide for the common defense of the American people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=103.0s)]
*  That's why we have a federal government. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=108.0s)]
*  And I think President Trump realizes that his most important responsibility under the Constitution [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=109.0s)]
*  as commander in chief is to keep the American people safe. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=115.0s)]
*  And that's what he's trying to do, get the worst of the worst as far away as he can [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=119.0s)]
*  from the American people who they would harm. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=123.0s)]
*  Obviously this is a threat and it seems like he plans on falling through with it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=126.0s)]
*  But do you think this is part of sending a message to the criminals as well that the days are numbered? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=131.0s)]
*  It absolutely is. And the president in your clip said it's a symbol of law and order. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=137.0s)]
*  And Lawrence, what we've had in this country the past four years is failure to communicate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=142.0s)]
*  Make no mistake, this president is communicating. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=147.0s)]
*  He's communicating to the American people that law and order and the rule of law will be upheld in his administration. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=150.0s)]
*  And he's communicating to the criminal element that it's a new day in America [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=156.0s)]
*  and law and order is here to stay as long as he's president. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=161.0s)]
*  How quickly could he reopen the prison? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=164.0s)]
*  I think pretty darn quick. He's already ordered the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=167.0s)]
*  and the Department of Homeland Security to get to work on this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=172.0s)]
*  It's going to involve the National Park Service, but I think Secretary Bergen will be ready to move out swiftly on this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=175.0s)]
*  All right, we'll be following it. Thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=182.0s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=185.0s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivaq-T6wN30&t=194.0s)]
