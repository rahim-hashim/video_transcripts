# Mark Levin: Kamala Harris comes from a radical left background
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg)
*  A live look at Beirut right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel fighting back against Hezboah, as today marks one year, one year since October 7th. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=4.9s)]
*  And VP Harris can't even call Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu an ally. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=9.92s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=15.0s)]
*  Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=16.0s)]
*  I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=23.72s)]
*  between the American people and the Israeli people? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  And the answer to that question is yes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=33.2s)]
*  Okay, reframe the question if you don't want to answer it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=35.4s)]
*  I never heard of that before. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=38.0s)]
*  Mark Levin is host of Life, Liberty and Levin, Saturdays and Sundays at 8 o'clock. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=39.56s)]
*  Mark, your thoughts about that schism that she has no problem talking about one year [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=44.16s)]
*  since those attacks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  She's evil. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  She's very evil. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  She's been undermining the state of Israel since she's been in the United States Senate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=55.6s)]
*  She's defended Talib in her comments. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=60.68s)]
*  She's never criticized any of the anti-Semites in her party. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  You'll notice they all support her. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=66.8s)]
*  She's made brotherhood and sisterhood with the River to the Sea crowd, with the mayor [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  of Dearborn, Michigan. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  She picked somebody as her vice presidential candidate who was friends with an imam who [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  talked about the evisceration of the Jews. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  She's a very evil person and I want to go beyond that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=85.56s)]
*  This administration is evil. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=89.48s)]
*  I don't believe October 7th would have happened, but for the appeasement and the subsidies [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=91.88s)]
*  given to Iran for the years leading up to October 7th by Blinken, by Biden and Harris. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=97.28s)]
*  They refueled their economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=104.44s)]
*  They made it possible for them to purchase arms. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=106.36s)]
*  They gave them a psychological advantage where they thought they could pretty much do anything [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=109.28s)]
*  and this administration would appease them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=112.84s)]
*  They pulled the trigger for Hamas to undertake this horrendous mass murder of Jews, unprovoked. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=115.68s)]
*  The next day Hezbollah is firing missiles. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=123.18s)]
*  On October 8th, Blinken puts out a tweet calling for a ceasefire and then quickly pulls it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=126.56s)]
*  back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=131.56s)]
*  These are evil people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=132.8s)]
*  They have an ideological view of what they want to happen to the region that goes back [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=134.58s)]
*  to the Obama administration. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=138.36s)]
*  They do not want Israel to be a power in that region. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=140.38s)]
*  They do not want Israel to be able to defend itself. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=144.22s)]
*  They talk out of both sides of their mouths. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=146.78s)]
*  We have 30% of the United States Navy in and around the Mediterranean Sea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=149.22s)]
*  In the meantime they're telling Israel right now, don't knock out Iran. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=153.82s)]
*  Don't knock out their nuclear weapons. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=158.62s)]
*  What? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=160.54s)]
*  Their nuclear site. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=161.54s)]
*  Don't hit their oil. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=162.54s)]
*  Do what we do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=163.7s)]
*  Appease. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=165.06s)]
*  We want to happen to Israel what we did to Afghanistan. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=166.06s)]
*  There was peace. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=169.5s)]
*  There are Arab nations stepping up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=170.82s)]
*  I read a piece the other day that Saudi Arabia is prepared to make peace with Israel except [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=173.06s)]
*  they want to see who wins because they know that Kamala Harris will not accept a peace [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=178.62s)]
*  with Israel and Saudi Arabia unless Israel capitulates to the Palestinians. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=183.84s)]
*  What's happened is this administration is leaked against Netanyahu. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  They're withholding arms from the military. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=194.7s)]
*  They're trying to make Israel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=197.46s)]
*  They're perpetrating. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=199.38s)]
*  The perpetrators, the victims, their envoy to the Middle East, to Iran, was a special [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=201.1s)]
*  pleader for Iran who had spies under him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=208.14s)]
*  We have never seen anything like this in American history. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=210.78s)]
*  The treatment of Israel, we don't treat any other country this way. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  You want to know why, Brian? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=217.46s)]
*  And I'll speak the truth. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=218.74s)]
*  This administration, like the Democrat Party now, is loaded with Jew-hating, Israel-hating [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=220.38s)]
*  anti-Semites. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=225.66s)]
*  You see it in the streets. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=227.26s)]
*  You see it in their constituency. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=228.86s)]
*  You see it in their colleges and universities. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=230.78s)]
*  They've barely done a damn thing to tamp down the anti-Semitism. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=233.22000000000003s)]
*  This has been a horrendous, horrendous period of time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=237.24s)]
*  We went from peace in our time to war in our time, and the victim is now under attack. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=241.02s)]
*  And for Kamala Harris, who can't lift a finger to Benjamin Netanyahu, to treat the elected [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=247.9s)]
*  who is now the most popular figure in Israel, like this publicly, to undermine him, to talk [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  about him this way, is a disgusting disgrace. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  And God willing, she won't get any closer to the Oval Office than she is right now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=265.58s)]
*  So Mark, you believe that there's slow-walking weapons still, not just the 2,000-pound bombs, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=270.06s)]
*  which they said they reinstated. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=275.22s)]
*  You believe there's a slow-walking of weapons, munitions of all kinds right now to Israel? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=276.98s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=283.22s)]
*  I know it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=284.22s)]
*  I know the entire list of weapons that they're withholding that has been given to me, including [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=286.1s)]
*  armored tractors that they need to use to clear minefields, even withholding them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  They're not withholding 2,000-pound bombs because Israel was dropping 2,000-pound bombs [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=297.1s)]
*  on schoolchildren in Gaza. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=301.98s)]
*  They were withholding 2,000-pound bombs because they didn't want Israel to take out Nasrallah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=304.06s)]
*  They don't want Israel to attack the nuclear site in the oil fields where they need those [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=309.62s)]
*  2,000-pound bombs. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=314.7s)]
*  They're withholding jets. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  They're withholding rifles. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=317.5s)]
*  They're withholding ammunition. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=318.94s)]
*  They're withholding all kinds of military equipment. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=320.46s)]
*  The only administration to do anything like this, but not to this extent, was Obama. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=323.46s)]
*  Obama's one of the ones calling the shots here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  And Obama is the one that has brought Kamala Harris in, who has worked Kamala Harris. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=331.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris comes from a radical left background. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=337.74s)]
*  Her pastor is anti-Israel. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=341.02s)]
*  Her father was a Marxist. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=343.34s)]
*  She is a San Francisco radical. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=344.85999999999996s)]
*  And here's the problem with Kamala Harris. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=347.78s)]
*  She is a radical Marxist Islamist ideologue. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=350.17999999999995s)]
*  She doesn't want to put in the work. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=353.78s)]
*  And the effort, as we've seen with this horrible hurricane, she wouldn't go to pre-hurricane [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=355.17999999999995s)]
*  events in order to figure out what to do. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  And on top of that, she just ain't that smart. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=362.14s)]
*  That's why they're treating her like a veal calf and keeping her as hidden as they can. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=365.17999999999995s)]
*  So I want to say to the people of Israel, the people of the United States support you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=370.34s)]
*  We share the same Bible that you do. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=376.38s)]
*  We share the same love of life that you do. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  Kamala Harris does not. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=381.38s)]
*  And I certainly hope people keep this in mind when they're voting early and when they're [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=383.38s)]
*  voting on election day. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=387.52s)]
*  They will, no doubt about it, except for those people rioting in the streets today in New [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=389.94s)]
*  York City, which are an embarrassment to the nation. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=393.9s)]
*  Mark Levin, thanks so much. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=396.78s)]
*  We'll make sure to catch your show Saturday and Sunday, 8 o'clock. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=397.78s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=400.58s)]
*  Mark Levin, joining us on a special day this Monday morning. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_dwWDBjMNg&t=401.58s)]
