# Democrats rage at Trump: '100 days of hell!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4)
*  Chad Pergrum is live at the Capitol with the latest. Chad. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, good morning, guys. House committees continue writing President [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=3.64s)]
*  Trump's big, beautiful bill today. They need nearly every Republican on board. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=6.68s)]
*  It's about the math. The president is imploring the GOP to vote yes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=11.72s)]
*  Every once in a while you have a grandstander Republican. We have some [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=17.32s)]
*  grandstanders, but every once in a while, not many, not many. But remember [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=21.0s)]
*  who those grandstanders were and vote him the hell out of office. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=26.6s)]
*  But this is the hard part, figuring out specifics in the bill. Members must be [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=30.96s)]
*  comfortable with supporting the overall product. House Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=35.64s)]
*  wants this done in the House by this time next month. The Senate is aiming [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  for July 4th, but some Republicans are skeptical of arbitrary deadlines. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=43.88s)]
*  It's not even a deadline. Just a thing. Like people just pick a number. It's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=49.24s)]
*  like, Oh, why is it like? Think about it. Christmas Easter Memorial Day, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=51.84s)]
*  July 4th is have anything to do with policy. Hell no. It has to do with what? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=55.78s)]
*  Jet fumes. People leaving town, right? Always. Some Republicans have major [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=60.76s)]
*  questions, but President Trump has one thing going for him. More support from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=66.56s)]
*  congressional Republicans. And that was not the case during his first term. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=70.84s)]
*  They seemed a little skeptical of him in 2017. That's not the case now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=76.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think we all watched what happened in November and the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=81.64s)]
*  mandate he got from the American people. It was it was clear it was decisive. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=85.46000000000001s)]
*  And he had a clear message that he campaigned on. Now, the two most [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=89.64s)]
*  important committees still need to write their sections of the bill. That's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=94.44s)]
*  the Ways and Means Committee for Tax Cuts and the Energy and Commerce [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=97.72s)]
*  Committee. That panel is charged with cutting a staggering $880 billion in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=102.16s)]
*  spending guys and Chad. The Republicans ultimately would like to cut. Oh, and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=108.72s)]
*  the reason it's it's hard to get them all on board is because they're trying [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=114.52s)]
*  to cut close to a trillion dollars to pay for all the stuff the president [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=117.94s)]
*  wants. And it's all about priorities. And there's a lot. Everybody's got a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=122.38s)]
*  different priority. And so that's why it's really complicated. Absolutely. You [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=126.94s)]
*  know, I've talked about salt reductions for state and local taxes. There's going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=131.1s)]
*  to be a meeting about that today. It was supposed to be yesterday. Members, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=134.74s)]
*  moderate Republicans from high tax states like New York and Pennsylvania. I [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=138.4s)]
*  talked to one moderate Republican who said, you know, this deadline late next [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=141.78s)]
*  month is almost impossible, especially some of the provisions that they are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=146.74s)]
*  talking about right now. And this is why we have to see pen to paper. And again, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  those two committees, what they're going to cut in taxes, people want to see [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=153.66s)]
*  what comes out of the Ways and Means Committee and then the Energy and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  Commerce Committee as well, because they have to cut the biggest chunk of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=159.62s)]
*  spending. All right. Thanks so much. The one thing is pretty certain that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=162.86s)]
*  Democrats aren't necessarily on board. Okay, none of them. You want proof? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=166.58s)]
*  Listen, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=171.06s)]
*  this week marks the 100th day of Donald Trump's second term as president of the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=172.26s)]
*  United States. It's been 100 days from hell. Chaos, corruption costs. It's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=180.7s)]
*  chaos. One fiasco after another in 100 days. What can a president accomplish? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=188.54s)]
*  The last 100 days, President Trump has made Americans less safe, less [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=196.06s)]
*  prosperous and less free. Today I am reading into the congressional record [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=200.34s)]
*  100 reports of corruption from Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. Trump [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=205.02s)]
*  and his administration have paved the way for the president, his top officials [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=211.26s)]
*  and his billionaire buddies to personally feed at the trough of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=217.02s)]
*  government corruption. So count with me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=221.94s)]
*  So they're going to try to be a part of the process, though. If you want [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=226.42s)]
*  something in the bill, if you have a better idea, pitch it to the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=231.18s)]
*  administration to write in the bill right now. This is your opportunity to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=235.94s)]
*  get something. There's a lot of them. They're going to be in swing states. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=238.7s)]
*  Gonna be tough races. You could have the photo op that you want saying I was a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=241.62s)]
*  bipartisan person with this important bill. I got you a tax cut, but it [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=245.28s)]
*  doesn't seem like that. They just want to do speeches on the floor that no [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=249.58s)]
*  one's watching. There were marathon speeches that, yeah, no one watched [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=253.44s)]
*  because it happened all the way until midnight last night talking about the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=255.72s)]
*  100 days from hell and all the things that they hated about Donald Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=259.36s)]
*  They're doing these singalongs on the steps. You're right. They need to get [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=263.24s)]
*  get in the room with the Republicans and mark up these bills or this big, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=267.2s)]
*  beautiful bill so that we can move forward. They're not gonna. I'm Steve [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do5O33fCsQ4&t=272.03999999999996s)]
