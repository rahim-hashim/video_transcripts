# Piers Morgan: Democrats have lost their humanity
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0)
*  So Democrats are being called out by their own party for their behavior during President Trump's address to Congress [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=0.0s)]
*  That is how you save democracy by quietly dissenting or [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=8.4s)]
*  Bidding on an antique tea set it was hard to tell what was going on [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=13.92s)]
*  I don't know who's thought up the bingo signs, but they should be fired [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=16.92s)]
*  Michael this is an indictment in my opinion on the Democratic leadership [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Well, we saw the theatrics tonight in the chamber are not being well received [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  I will say I thought Democrat. I thought that was just I think there were times when they should have risen [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=29.2s)]
*  I think what Al Green did was despicable and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=33.76s)]
*  Even Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman expressed his disappointment posting this on social media [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=37.48s)]
*  It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=42.96s)]
*  We're becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to and it may not be the winning message [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=46.44s)]
*  Joining us right now is the host of Pierce Morgan uncensored. He puts his name in every show [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=53.82s)]
*  Here's Morgan great [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=58.32s)]
*  Watching you try to interview the head of world football. You couldn't even remember the name of the sport [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=62.72s)]
*  It's football. Oh, you do that was one of the more comical things [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=67.26s)]
*  I would is only as I would talk only rival by what happened over here on the floor, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=70.7s)]
*  She very well done Norris, but that was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=75.88s)]
*  American sport [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=81.8s)]
*  It is football right you want to defend me [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=83.92s)]
*  About America don't come into our home [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=87.64s)]
*  And tell us can't yell with a smile on your face. So what do you think? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=90.88s)]
*  What about Democrats? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=95.64s)]
*  What I think I think it was one I was watching it live here in you [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=97.68s)]
*  I thought it was one of the most pathetic. Yeah petty [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=101.44s)]
*  Shameful things I've ever witnessed and he went on and on and on and you know back in the UK [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=105.2s)]
*  We have Parliament. It gets very rowdy very noisy. They all have a pop at each other [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=111.56s)]
*  They lock horns what you would never see is somebody like that 13 year old boy a can't a brain cancer survivor [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  Who's been through 12 surgeries? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=123.08s)]
*  I think who's being there having his dream lived out on global television and Donald Trump has facilitated that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=125.16s)]
*  Just get up get up and applaud that boy the fact they couldn't even do that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=133.24s)]
*  I thought was just contemptible [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=138.36s)]
*  I really did and the Democrats [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=140.32s)]
*  Take a good long hard look at themselves because the stupid signs they're not getting up for the poor families of these murdered people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=142.2s)]
*  The way they treated that boy [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=150.2s)]
*  The walkouts this silly Instagram stuff afterwards. Look at me. I didn't go in this is the president of the United States speaking [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=152.56s)]
*  What's going on in the heart of politics? I think they've honestly Lawrence. They've lost the plot [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=160.2s)]
*  The Democrats have lost the plot. They did not see this big win coming for Trump in in the election [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=164.24s)]
*  They got completely wiped [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=170.44s)]
*  They've lost all power and they are scrabbling to work out what they do about this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=172.04s)]
*  And I think the key messages that Trump keeps ramming home that America is no longer a woke country [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=176.28s)]
*  And the secondly he's he's a pioneer of a revolution of common sense. They don't know what to do about this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=182.0s)]
*  I mean on one hand you've got them all in their pink gear [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=188.48s)]
*  Right going on about women's rights on the other [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=190.92s)]
*  They won't applaud a president who wants to bring back equality and fairness to women's sport in America [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=193.4s)]
*  Here's we a lot of people can relate to this though that are Republicans or conservative because if you support Trump [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=199.24s)]
*  They hate you too. Yeah, and so they this little boy he's there. It's not about Trump at that moment [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  It's about this little boy and Trump's just allowing him to be a Secret Service agent [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  We don't know how that child's family votes from Houston [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  But also that moment is I thought when Trump invited him to the Oval Office with his family [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  That's right. I'm a little boy saying can I give you a hug? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  That is the human side of Donald Trump which we've all seen a lot of right I'm really pleased with seeing more of that this time [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=225.8s)]
*  Round because that is what he can be about and I think the Democrats have lost their sense of humanity [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=231.52s)]
*  And they just they just don't know what to do is it's extraordinary to watch next week last week [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  We had McCrone and Stalmer come visit and then with Zelensky in the meltdown on Friday [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=241.6s)]
*  And now there was an emergency meeting last night with European leaders [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=245.62s)]
*  How do you view the European asked and told to come together and support Ukraine or other causes? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=248.68s)]
*  Build up your military take ownership. How does that look from the inside? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=255.44s)]
*  Trump is a hundred percent right about this and he has been [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=259.96s)]
*  From the moment in his first term [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=262.8s)]
*  He went on about NATO and how the European countries were simply not paying their dues and they weren't and guess what now most of them [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=264.68s)]
*  Do but they should still be now paying more, you know, Poland [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=271.9s)]
*  I think has gone to 5% GDP are amazing now, right? They're leading the way [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=275.72s)]
*  Europe should be standing on its own two feet [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=279.92s)]
*  If I was an American I would be sick and tired of constantly having this assumption from Europe that you will always be here to pick [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=282.04s)]
*  Up the pieces to pay the bills to do all the fighting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=289.46s)]
*  I'm very proud that the UK is fought alongside America in many conflicts [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=292.26s)]
*  My brother was a British Army colonel fought in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=296.32s)]
*  So, you know nothing means more to me than that special relationship, but at the same time Europe has got to start punching its way [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=299.6s)]
*  I like the fact my new Prime Minister Keir Stalmer and McCrone [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=305.64s)]
*  Seem to be leading this way now for Europe to step up properly [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  But I hope we do a deal in the end that brings the Trump wants peace where the Americans are there [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=312.92s)]
*  But you're not having to do all the heavy lifting like you normally do appears [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=318.88s)]
*  Do we because some of the messaging from the mainstream media and Democrats is that I don't think we look weak [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=322.38s)]
*  But they feel like we look weak as a country. What is the perception in the UK? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=327.56s)]
*  It's funny because I spoke to President Trump last Friday morning [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=333.24s)]
*  Just out the day after he'd seen the British Prime Minister at the White House and I think I texted him [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=337.48s)]
*  I said I've never seen better media coverage in the UK than what I've seen this morning every front page [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=342.48s)]
*  Lording the return of the special relationship [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=348.04s)]
*  Then there was the Oval Office bust up the negative morning front pages the complete opposite which is very you know [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=350.6s)]
*  That's very Trump world, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=356.38s)]
*  I think the reality is as always people react hysterically to everything the president does [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=357.72s)]
*  They can't really work out what's going on. I always try and remind them [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=363.48s)]
*  I'm known as the Trump whisperer in the UK. What is he? What's he really doing? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  I said, why don't you just remember what he is negotiation? He's a businessman who's negotiating [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=371.68s)]
*  I think Donald Trump genuinely wants peace [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=376.44s)]
*  I think that he wants to bring everyone to the table [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=378.92s)]
*  But I think he also wants Ukraine to accept that the war is where it is [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=382.0s)]
*  This war has not moved in eight nine months hundreds of thousands of people have been killed on this battlefield [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=386.02s)]
*  It has got to stop but he's got to do it [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  I think in a way where America is strong [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  But also the Europeans understand this is a war happening in Europe and you can't just go knocking on the door and say America [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=395.9s)]
*  Sort it all out for us. It's got to be a concerted team effort [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=402.9s)]
*  And I think personally knowing how Donald Trump feels about this [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  I think he will get that and in the end we'll look back on this period as being a little bit rocky as these things [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  Always are when you try and sort out a war but ultimately I think we'll get to peace and people will thank him [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=415.22s)]
*  We'll see if this is the one deal that Putin sticks to because he's famous for you know, what's interesting [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=420.70000000000005s)]
*  I found a clip and he went viral actually and it was from when I interviewed Bill Clinton at CNN about ten years ago [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=425.42s)]
*  And he was talking about his dealings with Vladimir Putin when he was president and Putin just come into power in Russia [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=430.1s)]
*  And he said the interesting thing was in public they'd have all their squabbles and everything else [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=436.1s)]
*  But in private if he agreed on something and shook hands with you he always kept his word [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  I think Trump has that relationship with Putin [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=445.82s)]
*  I think that they say what they say in public were fine and he has to play the game a bit to get Putin to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=448.7s)]
*  The table, but I think behind the scenes [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=453.82s)]
*  There's a lot of talking going on and clearly Trump believes when it's him and Putin [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=455.54s)]
*  He can trust it that may be enough in in this situation. We'll see [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  See, I told you I told you he was gonna be a good guess. They didn't think so [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=463.82s)]
*  I've got all morning [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=467.94s)]
*  What's your luck kick a football? I'm as like do they even know what the sport is? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=470.18s)]
*  I know I'm gonna be judging at you out there. They so weird for a Brit to be arrogant about soccer [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=473.66s)]
*  We know you took our sport you change the shape of the ball you put padding and helmets on [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=482.7s)]
*  They made a better co-host before it's time for Ainsley to talk. We got to pass over to the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  We're just taking time away from Brian's next interview [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=493.34s)]
*  I've got all morning [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=497.26s)]
*  Nothing better than taking time out of Brian's time nothing's in the world [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=507.62s)]
*  Here's always good to see you [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=513.26s)]
*  You [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqprY8UxG0&t=526.94s)]
