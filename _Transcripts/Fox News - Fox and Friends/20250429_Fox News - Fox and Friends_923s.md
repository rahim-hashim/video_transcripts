# 'Fox & Friends' looks back on Trump's first 100 days: 'Seems like 4 years'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo)
*  Sit back and relax the show because today President Trump is set to commemorate his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=0.0s)]
*  first 100 days with an event in the state of Michigan where he's expected to make a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=4.68s)]
*  major announcement for the future of America's car business. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=9.36s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live at the White House with the details. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=13.0s)]
*  Good morning, Maddie. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=15.46s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  A senior administration official tells Fox that the move today to soften the blow of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  some of those car tariffs is meant to give manufacturers more time to move production [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=21.56s)]
*  back to the United States. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  A lot of industry insiders had mentioned concerns that doing something like that could potentially [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=27.68s)]
*  take years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=32.24s)]
*  So Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says this deal is a major victory for the president's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=33.52s)]
*  trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture rather domestically while providing runaway [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=44.78s)]
*  their domestic manufacturing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  So here's what we might see. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=50.88s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports the 25 percent tariffs on foreign-made cars and parts will [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=52.92s)]
*  remain in effect, but the automakers won't have to pay other duties like those on steel [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  and aluminum. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=61.96s)]
*  This would be retroactive, meaning the manufacturers will be reimbursed for the tariffs they have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=63.24s)]
*  already paid, and they'll also be reimbursed for some of the tariffs on imported auto [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=67.58s)]
*  parts that Levy is supposed to take effect on Saturday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=71.84s)]
*  The changes come as polls show most voters remain gloomy about the economy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=75.6s)]
*  As the president marks his 100th day in office today, a Fox News poll shows 38 percent approve [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=79.68s)]
*  of his performance on the economy, 56 percent disapprove, 33 percent approve of his moves [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=85.58000000000001s)]
*  on tariffs, 59 percent disapprove. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  But Treasury Secretary Scott Besson is aiming to reshape the message around the economy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=93.9s)]
*  We've got a three-legged stool here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  It's trade, it's tax, it's deregulation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=102.98s)]
*  President Trump has come out of the box roaring. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=105.9s)]
*  I mean, this is something new for the American people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=108.96s)]
*  He's given one, two press conferences a day, an incredible level of transparency. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=111.16s)]
*  And Besson will be attending the briefing today with White House Press Secretary Caroline [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=118.72s)]
*  Lovett. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=122.5s)]
*  That briefing is supposed to take place at 8.30 a.m. Eastern time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=123.5s)]
*  Yesterday, Besson met with top GOP negotiators on the president's one big, beautiful bill, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=127.24s)]
*  and they're really looking to that to unlock a lot of the president's domestic priorities, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=132.4s)]
*  especially on border security, defense, and taxes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=136.6s)]
*  Laurence Steve Ainsley and Brian. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  All right, Madeline. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=141.2s)]
*  I wonder if Caroline Lovett will start having these press conferences at 8.30 each morning, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=142.2s)]
*  because yesterday she had that one with Tom Homan. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Today she's having it with Scott Besson. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=148.16s)]
*  He talked to the GOP leaders about our economy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump did a great job handling immigration and handling our borders. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  He's cleaned up our country in a major way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=156.16s)]
*  Now everyone, when you are in the streets, they love what he's doing, but they say what [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  he's doing with the car industry, this is going to be wonderful, really focused on the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=162.66s)]
*  tariffs and getting some of these deals done. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=165.34s)]
*  Well, and the thing about having a press briefing at 8.30, it's an hour before the market opens. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=167.06s)]
*  And so if the administration's got something that could move the markets, it's a smart [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=171.94s)]
*  move. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=175.26s)]
*  Well, I think the administration is taking the messaging back, getting right back to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=176.26s)]
*  why he was elected. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=179.78s)]
*  So it started yesterday with what was happening at the border. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=181.5s)]
*  I don't think we've had a more secure border. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=184.26s)]
*  Tom Homan's leadership there, it was a campaign promise. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  Then you have today where people are saying, oh, the president doesn't understand our pain. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=190.58s)]
*  He's going out there saying, look, I'm going to those union workers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=194.5s)]
*  These were normally Democratic voters. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=197.18s)]
*  They switched over to the Republican Party. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=199.26s)]
*  He's saying, look, I'm going to help you out with some of the pain as we figure out this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=200.86s)]
*  tear situation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=204.46s)]
*  Now it's your move, China. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=206.42s)]
*  Do you want to make a deal? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=207.42s)]
*  Didn't you miss Lawrence? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=208.62s)]
*  He was on vacation last week. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=209.62s)]
*  I mean, that's who you met. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=210.62s)]
*  Look how fresh he is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=211.62s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=212.62s)]
*  And I just, I like to add too that today's going to be more really impactful because [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=213.62s)]
*  it's, he talked the economic message and Scott Besson is the people, people want to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=219.02s)]
*  hear from and they want to see deals come in and I think they're close. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=223.1s)]
*  I've been really impressed with him. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=225.7s)]
*  You've known him for a long time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=226.98s)]
*  He's smooth. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=227.98s)]
*  He's been doing the radio show for like two years and people used to introduce him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=228.98s)]
*  He might be treasury secretary and the answer would be, well, I never heard of him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=231.94s)]
*  And now everyone's heard of him. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=236.04s)]
*  Here's a look back at the hundred days as they were as you lived them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRDROo2Wo&t=238.14000000000001s)]
