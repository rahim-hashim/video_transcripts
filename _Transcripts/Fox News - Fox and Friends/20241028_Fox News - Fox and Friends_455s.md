# Trump campaign denounces comedian's rally joke: 'POOR TASTE'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y)
*  Meanwhile, former President Trump taking the stage at Madison Square Garden just hours ago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=0.0s)]
*  in front of thousands last night where he slammed Vice President Harris [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=4.0s)]
*  and vowed to bring back the American dream. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=8.0s)]
*  Next Tuesday you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've done a terrible job. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=12.0s)]
*  We're not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you're fired! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=21.0s)]
*  We're bringing back the American dream and we're going to bring it back at the highest level that you've ever seen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=26.0s)]
*  We're seeing historic levels of support among our black population, Hispanic population, and our Asian population. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=34.0s)]
*  So Jews and Muslims and Catholics and evangelicals and Mormons, they're all joining our cause in large numbers, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=42.0s)]
*  larger than anyone has ever seen in this country before, larger than they've ever seen in any country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=50.0s)]
*  And the Republican Party has really become the party of inclusion. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=57.0s)]
*  Trump 2024 National Press Secretary, Caroline Levitt joins us now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=63.0s)]
*  Caroline, you were there last night. What was it like backstage? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=69.0s)]
*  What was it surrounded by 20,000 people almost as he took the stage? We're a week away. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=72.0s)]
*  It was amazing. The energy last night was packable in the room. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=77.0s)]
*  The spirit, it was happiness and joy. And it was such a diverse group of people in that stadium. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=81.0s)]
*  Packed to the house, there wasn't an empty seat. You had black Americans, Latino Americans, Jewish Americans, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=87.0s)]
*  men, women of all ages coming in support of President Trump. And unafraid to show it, by the way, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=92.0s)]
*  even in the streets here, a very liberal New York City, which I think there's a chance of getting very red after last night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=98.0s)]
*  President Trump's message was optimistic. And I loved what Mrs. Trump said. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=104.0s)]
*  She said New York is a city of hope and dreams. You have people bustling from office to office to make a living. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=108.0s)]
*  And those dreams are becoming unattainable because of Democrat policies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=114.0s)]
*  And I think President Trump offered a real message of hope to New Yorkers and all Americans. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=117.0s)]
*  And what an epic way to kick off. Yeah, it was epic. You know, the world's most famous venue. He always wanted to play it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=122.0s)]
*  It was essentially a three or four or five or maybe 12 hour event for a lot of people. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=128.0s)]
*  But, you know, this morning, mainstream media has picked up on the comics comments, which were offensive, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=133.0s)]
*  have been denounced by the campaign and everybody else. What what went on with that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=138.0s)]
*  Look, it was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste. Obviously, that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=142.0s)]
*  And I think it is sad that the media will pick up on one joke that was made by a comedian [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=150.0s)]
*  rather than the truths that were shared by the phenomenal list of speakers that we had. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=155.0s)]
*  We had Congress men and women. We had Senator J.D. Vance. We had Dana White, friends of the president, Dan Scavino, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=160.0s)]
*  my colleague and friend who shared very intimate moments with President Trump when they were in the hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=166.0s)]
*  really showing the truth about President Trump and his heart of gold. And the crowd, they didn't mind, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=173.0s)]
*  Again, it was a diverse group of people. The joke fell flat. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=179.0s)]
*  But the crowd was there because they know who President Trump is and they know he wants to be a president for all Americans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=182.0s)]
*  So, Caroline, let's talk about the ground game, because when you when you look at the polling, when you see the Trump movement, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=189.0s)]
*  it's clear that the momentum is on you guys' side right now. The question is, how do you get that momentum to the polls as well? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=194.0s)]
*  So what are you guys doing differently this time that you all did the last election? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=202.0s)]
*  Well, I may be biased, but I think Team Trump has the best ground game in the business right now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=206.0s)]
*  And our team has been out there on the ground focusing on registering voters and turning out voters for months, doing that hard work. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=210.0s)]
*  And we're seeing it pay off in the early voting returns. Pennsylvania, there's been a 20 point swing from 2020 in early voting towards Republicans. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=217.0s)]
*  North Carolina, Republicans are leading the early vote right now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=224.0s)]
*  Nevada, the first day of early voting in Clark County, Republicans led by 19 points. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=227.0s)]
*  And so we are seeing Republicans and all Americans are taking President Trump seriously when he says, get out and bank your vote early. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=233.0s)]
*  So I'll use this opportunity to share that with the American people today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=240.0s)]
*  Please get out and vote early. And then you have the next week to bring all your friends and family with you to the polls. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=243.0s)]
*  But the signs we're seeing in early voting coming in are very encouraging. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=248.0s)]
*  We're not taking a single second for granted. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=252.0s)]
*  President's going to Georgia today and he'll be barnstorming the country every day for the next week. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=254.0s)]
*  Well, he played Madden with the Tim Walton at a point like yesterday with AOC. You don't have to answer that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=258.0s)]
*  That was too controversial. All right. So yesterday, JD Vance says this thing where he sits in a chair. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=264.0s)]
*  And Sunday, he does three Sunday shows. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=270.0s)]
*  So right away, Jake Tapper thought, let's focus on General Kelly and what General Mattis said about the former president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=274.0s)]
*  Watch. We've now spent five minutes talking about people in Donald Trump's staff who think he's not fit for office fired. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=283.0s)]
*  Well, we're actually talk about how Americans can't afford groceries. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=292.0s)]
*  We talk about the fact that Americans can't afford the cost of housing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=296.0s)]
*  Ask yourself a basic question about network integrity. You guys talked about the Russia hoax nonstop. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=299.0s)]
*  The FBI was investigating it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=306.0s)]
*  You took the words of unnamed FBI agents and put them on your network as if they were the gospel truth. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=307.0s)]
*  You did it again and again because you guys seem to care more about Donald Trump's past than the future of the American people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=313.0s)]
*  Your thought about that exchange, which went on for about 25 minutes. I mean, almost it was it was brutal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=321.0s)]
*  I mean, it was another take down by Senator Vance. He is the best surrogate we have on behalf of President Trump. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=327.0s)]
*  He's so good. But you know why he's good? Because he speaks the truth. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=332.0s)]
*  And it's easy to do that when you have truth on your side. And Jake Tapper and CNN pushed lies about President Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=335.0s)]
*  They have for the past nearly 10 years now. They were the lead propagandist of the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=341.0s)]
*  Never walked that reporting back. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=346.0s)]
*  There are still journalists out there who have Pulitzer prizes for reporting on fake intel and fake stories about President Trump. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=348.0s)]
*  And look, the American people are realizing you can't buy the lies of the mainstream media. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=355.0s)]
*  That's why today in twenty twenty four, President Trump is more popular than he has ever been since 2016. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=359.0s)]
*  They're not buying it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=365.0s)]
*  Nick Mulvaney and Reince Priebus, also chief of staff, they know nothing about that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=366.0s)]
*  They want to interview and get some balance there. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=370.0s)]
*  And it's pretty clear that as great a person as General Kelly is and what everything matters for the country, they didn't get along with the president. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=372.0s)]
*  And if you talk to H.R. McMaster, he writes in his book that they didn't like the president and they thought it was their job to rein him in. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=379.0s)]
*  Why don't they think they should balance out that conversation? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=386.0s)]
*  Because it's the Atlantic and it's Jeffrey Goldberg and it's the same reporter who authored the suckers and losers hoax ahead of the 2020 election. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=389.0s)]
*  He's not a journalist. He's an activist and he acts on behalf of the Democrat Party in the left. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=397.0s)]
*  Well, Caroline, you were in the press shop as well. That's right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=402.0s)]
*  In the day. Yes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=405.0s)]
*  You remember hearing anything about this? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=406.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, they were leaking like crazy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=408.0s)]
*  So this would have come out. That's right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=410.0s)]
*  Here at a time. Absolutely not. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=412.0s)]
*  These are unequivocally false lies about President Trump. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=413.0s)]
*  And there are multiple on the record sources who refuted this. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=417.0s)]
*  Some of them who don't even speak to President Trump anymore. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=420.0s)]
*  But they came out to say this is false and I feel an obligation to speak the truth. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=422.0s)]
*  And again, the American people see that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=427.0s)]
*  Well, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=428.0s)]
*  We know you're busy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=430.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=431.0s)]
*  I don't know how you do it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=432.0s)]
*  She had a baby three months ago. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=433.0s)]
*  She was back on the job. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=434.0s)]
*  Back on the job immediately. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=435.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=436.0s)]
*  One more week. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=437.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=438.0s)]
*  Mama's coming to help this week, right? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=439.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=440.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=441.0s)]
*  Well, bad news, if you win, it's going to be a lot more than one more week. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=442.0s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufI9SKrC10Y&t=452.0s)]
