# Trump-Harris debate rules released
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg)
*  Speaking of persuading voters, the former president is making a new case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's one that I haven't heard from. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=4.44s)]
*  He's telling the American people, look, you may not like my personality. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=6.76s)]
*  You may not like everything about me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=11.6s)]
*  But one thing you can admit is life was better. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=13.92s)]
*  And you don't have — you can't afford to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=16.44s)]
*  So this is the former president last night with Sean Hannity. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=20.54s)]
*  You can't take the chance. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  You have no choice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=25.64s)]
*  You've got to vote for me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=26.64s)]
*  You've got to vote for me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=27.64s)]
*  You've got to. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=29.28s)]
*  Even if you don't like me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=32.28s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=35.28s)]
*  It's — it's — no, but even if you don't like me, you can sit there and say, I can't [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=38.28s)]
*  stand that guy, but there's no way I'm going to vote for her. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=43.96s)]
*  No, you have to have fracking. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=47.24s)]
*  You know, you're the biggest in the country for this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=49.36s)]
*  You have two of the biggest sites in the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=51.8s)]
*  It's a massive business for Pennsylvania, and you can't take a chance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=54.96s)]
*  She will not allow fracking. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=58.96s)]
*  It's still about the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=60.32s)]
*  The people are being treated horribly in this country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=64.4s)]
*  We're a country that's being laughed at all over the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=67.4s)]
*  And I'll be honest, if Joe Biden would be a great president, I would be happier than [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=71.36s)]
*  being the worst president in the history of our country, because I want to see what's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=77.6s)]
*  good for the country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=81.98s)]
*  — wide-ranging. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=83.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=85.36s)]
*  He covered a lot of territory. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=86.36s)]
*  Obviously, he's also thinking about the debate, which is going to take place just in about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=88.36s)]
*  a week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  It's going to be on September the 10th. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  And Kamala Harris is heading to Pittsburgh to so-called debate camp, where she's going [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=98.12s)]
*  to be hunkered down. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=103.44s)]
*  It's going to be televised by ABC and then simulcast as well. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=104.44s)]
*  We had heard that she was trying to make sure that all the mics were open. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=115.16s)]
*  Ultimately, they decided both sides, the mics would be muted. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=116.16s)]
*  So these are the ground rules, essentially. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=120.24s)]
*  The microphones will be muted except when the candidate who's speaking is speaking. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  And immediately, then it goes off. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=127.8s)]
*  No live audience to cheer for either side. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  There will be a pen, paper, and a bottle of water at the lectern. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=132.12s)]
*  You can't take notes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=136.76s)]
*  There will be two-minute answers. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=138.18s)]
*  No pre-written notes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=141.12s)]
*  But you can take notes on the fly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=142.12s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=143.12s)]
*  But you can't take any in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=144.12s)]
*  Two-minute rebuttals and a one-minute extra minute for follow-ups, clarifications, or [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=145.12s)]
*  responses. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  So pretty much what we have seen in the past. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  So Politico was reporting, because we know Kamala wanted the open mics. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=153.72000000000003s)]
*  They're reporting that her debate team has been in upheaval because they haven't gotten [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=158.24s)]
*  that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=162.36s)]
*  Karen Dunn, who's in charge of debate prep, is being described as more roast because she [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=163.36s)]
*  wants to have this Kavanaugh-like moment where she's prosecuting the case. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  She did it to Mike Pence. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=170.2s)]
*  Let me speak. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=171.2s)]
*  But there may be some nuance to the rules. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=172.2s)]
*  Yes, I'm speaking. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  MJ Lee of CNN says this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  There have been some assurances offered to the Harris campaign about how the network [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  would handle any moments of significant cross-talk. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=179.76s)]
*  So the mics are muted, but who's the muter? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  Who's doing the muting? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=186.48s)]
*  Because that guy's got a lot of power if he isn't giving assurances about cross-talk. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=187.48s)]
*  Could be a woman. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=191.44s)]
*  Could be a woman? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=192.56s)]
*  Oh, I guess I'm biased. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=193.56s)]
*  Women can shut you down too. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=195.12s)]
*  They can. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=196.44s)]
*  I would say a couple things. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=197.44s)]
*  I remember last time that they did bring up the mics sometime in cross-talk. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=198.76s)]
*  You'd hear a couple words from the other candidate, and then the mic would go up. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=202.48s)]
*  So there'll be that moment, I'm sure, of unscriptedness. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=207.16s)]
*  The other thing was it's going to be, if we can put up those rules one more time, the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=210.72s)]
*  ABC debate, I think it's going to be key for the follow-ups. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=215.2s)]
*  It's going to be the two-minute rebuttal and extra clarification. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=219.28s)]
*  One thing about Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, they laid out on the clarification. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=223.6s)]
*  So I'm wondering if ABC is going to come in and say, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=227.54s)]
*  Mr. President, I think you're wrong here, or that's not exactly how it went. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=232.34s)]
*  That's when you're going to find out about the moderators. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=236.34s)]
*  You mean fact check out? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=238.14s)]
*  Yeah, if they're going to do that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=239.14s)]
*  Because neither one of those anchors did last time. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=240.14s)]
*  Well, and me personally, I appreciated them staying out of the way. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=242.5s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=246.3s)]
*  Me too. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=247.3s)]
*  Because when you start putting your—it would be nice if people could leave their biases [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=248.3s)]
*  behind and just ask the questions and do fair fact checks back and forth. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=252.38s)]
*  They've lost the trust of the American people in that area. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=258.34s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=260.74s)]
*  The former president got to—you have to let her talk. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=261.88s)]
*  Much like Joe Biden, he may have had some cognitive decline, but you got to let her [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=263.94s)]
*  talk because that's when the word salad starts to happen and all the—if she wants [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=269.82s)]
*  to explain a policy, let her explain that policy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  And much like the current president, he didn't use a lot of his time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  There was moments in that debate that were like, Mr. President, you still got 90 seconds. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=281.54s)]
*  That's where I loved what he did yesterday in the town hall when he was self-deprecating. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=284.42s)]
*  You may not like me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  You may hate me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  But I have the best policy for our country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  He can do that with Kamala Harris. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I don't say everything right, Kamala, but you have failed our country. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=294.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  People are poor because of you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  People are in trouble. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  Suburban moms across this country are hurting because of you and Joe Biden. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  It's so much harder being Trump because you have to go against—am I going against [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=302.98s)]
*  the senator, the AG, the vice president, or the new Kamala Harris, who doesn't say anything. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=307.5s)]
*  How exciting. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  Anonymous surrogates. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  You never know who's going to show up. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, anonymous surrogates say she's changed her positions. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  So at the back of your head, you've got to study for all four. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  Will the real Kamala please stand up? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=319.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=321.7s)]
*  There you go. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=322.7s)]
*  She'll be standing up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=323.7s)]
*  She'll know she wanted to sit down. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=324.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=325.7s)]
*  That's all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=326.7s)]
*  So both of them weighed in yesterday on the big event next week. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=327.7s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  House of East West! [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=332.66s)]
*  Vice President, House of East West! [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=336.66s)]
*  They wanted notes. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=356.66s)]
*  They wanted to be seated, and they wanted your mic hot. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=357.66s)]
*  And they wanted a desk. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=359.58000000000004s)]
*  They didn't want to do—I said, you get a desk. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  I said, you got to do a stand-up. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=361.94s)]
*  After they already agreed to the other. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=362.94s)]
*  Yeah, but they wanted a desk from the beginning. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=365.14s)]
*  You know who else wanted a desk? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=367.5s)]
*  Sleepy Joe. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=369.3s)]
*  He wanted a desk. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=370.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=371.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=372.3s)]
*  Sleepy Joe wanted a nap. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=373.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=374.3s)]
*  He's probably taking one. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=375.3s)]
*  Yeah, he probably is. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=376.3s)]
*  On the beach, maybe. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=377.3s)]
*  So 90 minutes long, two commercial breaks, muted mics. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  So Brian Fallon came out and said basically, okay, you got your way. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=382.62s)]
*  Trump can't be controlled. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=387.86s)]
*  That indicates that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=389.06s)]
*  No, this was Joe Biden's idea. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=390.06s)]
*  No one even heard of these rules. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=392.26s)]
*  These were the ridiculous rules that you guys presented. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=393.26s)]
*  And Trump said, I'll give you anything that you want. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=396.82s)]
*  All I want to do is be able to stand for the debate. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=398.94s)]
*  So it's pretty unbelievable. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=402.14000000000004s)]
*  After they tried to ring Trump into doing this debate, saying, look, you already agreed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=405.82s)]
*  to it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  Now they want to change the rules. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=411.58000000000004s)]
*  So which argument do you guys want? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=412.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, and that debate, Trump won. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  Of course he did. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=416.26s)]
*  But then again, Biden really lost it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=417.26s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=419.66s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI6MDip0Hg&t=420.66s)]
