# CHILLING warning issued after Biden transfers Gitmo detainees: 'They'll be back'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk)
*  President Biden transferring 11 Gitmo Bay detainees with suspected al-Qaeda ties to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=0.0s)]
*  Oman, including two alleged former bodyguards for UBL. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=7.16s)]
*  All of the men have been held since shortly after the 9-11 attacks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=11.64s)]
*  Retired Lieutenant Colonel Donald Arias. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=15.56s)]
*  His brother was killed in the attack and he's been to Gitmo three times to witness the proceedings. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=17.48s)]
*  Almost all of them stopped short. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=22.64s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=24.32s)]
*  Colonel, your feeling about this move? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=25.32s)]
*  I can't imagine any normal American being okay with this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  I mean, these are dangerous people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=32.92s)]
*  These 11 detainees, you know, they were, they couldn't try them, but they were too dangerous [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=34.92s)]
*  to release. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  So now we're going to let them loose on the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  We're going to get them resettled. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=43.64s)]
*  We're going to get them back on track with their lives. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=45.12s)]
*  What, so they can return to the battlefield and come back to haunt us? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=48.32s)]
*  We haven't heard the last of these guys. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm certain they'll be back. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=53.44s)]
*  What did you notice when you were down there? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Do you see repentant people realize the error of their ways when you were in the courtroom? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=56.52s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=61.2s)]
*  You know, I was there in 2009 when, and it was a competency hearing for Ramsey bin al-Sheb. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=63.2s)]
*  When KSM stood up in the courtroom and said, I did it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  I said, I did it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=71.88s)]
*  We did it for Jihad and I'd do it again. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=72.88s)]
*  To me, I'm not a lawyer, but that's a courtroom confession. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=75.36s)]
*  That wasn't good enough for anybody then. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=78.44s)]
*  So they were not repentant, not in the least. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=80.4s)]
*  I mean, these guys are steeped in this ideology and have been festering down there in Gitmo. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=83.0s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, they can fester there forever. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=87.8s)]
*  Remember, Obama swapped him out. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  They were reformed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  They were going to stay in the neighboring nation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  Now they have their key officials in the new Taliban to Afghanistan story. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, so they're basically laughing in our face. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=100.56s)]
*  They come back as heroes once they're out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=103.16s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=106.56s)]
*  And again, you know, 9-11 families have been screwed so many times. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=107.88s)]
*  We're just used to it at this point. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=111.16s)]
*  It's just another day we're going to have to roll with, you know? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=112.88s)]
*  And the emotional toll, Brian, people don't understand. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  You know, you lose a loved one and there is zero justice for them, zero. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, if my brother were mugged on the streets of New York, this thing would have been long gone. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=122.52s)]
*  Well, maybe not with Alvin Bragg, but this thing would have been long adjudicated. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  And if you look back at like, you know, my brother was killed in 2001 along with thousands of others. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=131.12s)]
*  My mother died in 2015, never seeing justice for her son. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=136.24s)]
*  My father passed in 2019. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=140.72s)]
*  Never seeing justice. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=142.76s)]
*  My sister, who accompanied me to Gitmo three times, died in 2021 during the pandemic. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=143.92s)]
*  And I'm getting ready to turn 68 here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=150.2s)]
*  I'm wondering if I'm going to live long enough to see this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=152.16s)]
*  And I don't think I will. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=154.28s)]
*  I think these guys are just whoever's calling the shots. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=155.56s)]
*  And we all know it's not Biden. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=159.04s)]
*  It's where his handlers are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  These leftist activists that are pulling the strings of this government and these legal soldiers of fortune that came out of NGO, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  leftist NGOs that were suing the government are now full time employees at the DOJ. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=169.92s)]
*  This is where all this crap comes from. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=176.0s)]
*  And, you know, we objects of pity, we 9-11 family members are just not smart enough to understand why they're doing it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=177.92s)]
*  No, you're not smart enough. You're smart enough to understand this is pure politics. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=186.44s)]
*  And someone trying to outdo perhaps President Obama, who said he wasn't going to do that, wasn't able to do this at Gitmo. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=190.16s)]
*  So 11 detainees go to Oman, but the worst could be yet to come. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, this Mohammed Rahim, a bodyguard of bin Laden, who is late as 2016, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=199.44s)]
*  the last time we heard of him, has reaffirmed his radical ways. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=205.68s)]
*  And the Al Qaeda doctrine could be swapped for three Americans that we left behind in Kabul in Afghanistan. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  I feel for the families. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  Michael Bacall was briefed on this, says it's a bad deal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=220.0s)]
*  Your thoughts about this bin Laden's bodyguard? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=223.76s)]
*  It's crazy. It's craziness. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  All we're doing is encouraging more kidnapping and more thugs out there to commit terrorism. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, when they know they can get away with it, spend a few years at Gitmo, come home with a hero. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  Why not do it again? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=241.64s)]
*  These guys don't mind blowing themselves up. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=243.6s)]
*  You think they're going to mind spending a few years in the clink? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=245.44s)]
*  I don't think so. I mean, the whole thing's outrageous. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  These people are war criminals. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=251.72s)]
*  They're illegal enemy combatants in violations of the law of war. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=253.48s)]
*  And they should have been tried in a wartime tribunal that we set up at Gitmo. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=258.32s)]
*  And if you look back and say, what do we got in history? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Look at these Nazi war crimes that we did in Nuremberg. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=264.8s)]
*  Nuremberg was, you know, over in 10 months. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=267.52s)]
*  These guys were tried, adjudicated, done, 10 months. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=270.12s)]
*  Next. Why are we still mucking around with these guys? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=274.68s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry about all the losses in your family as you wait for justice. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=277.48s)]
*  But I know your brother would be proud that you're still fighting for him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=280.6s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Donald Darius, thanks so much. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=283.52s)]
*  Thanks, Brian. Thanks for having me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=287.68s)]
*  And we'll track all this as it unfolds. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=290.88s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZmAU-QU0Nk&t=292.71999999999997s)]
