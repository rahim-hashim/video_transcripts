# Trump gives local mom $100 to pay for groceries: 'A complete surprise'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI)
*  That's right. While he was in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump made a mom's day, surprising [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=0.0s)]
*  her with big help toward her grocery bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=5.2s)]
*  Here. He's going to go down a little bit. It just went down a hundred bucks. We'll do [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=8.0s)]
*  that for you from the White House, all right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=16.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=18.0s)]
*  All right, bye. Nice seeing you, everybody. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=19.0s)]
*  Yep, he just handed somebody a hundred bucks. Well, that somebody is that person there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=20.64s)]
*  On the screen left right now joining us those grateful Pennsylvania parents, Jenny and Brian [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=25.8s)]
*  Cantz. Good morning to both of you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=30.72s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=32.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=33.8s)]
*  So Jenny, tell us a little bit about that. So your cousin owns that store and the Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=34.8s)]
*  team called up and said, hey, we would like to have a family at the checkout. Is that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=41.8s)]
*  right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=45.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=46.8s)]
*  And what else did they tell you? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=47.8s)]
*  We were hoping to meet him and the fact that he handed us a hundred dollars was a complete [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=51.96s)]
*  surprise. And it was a great experience. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=59.96s)]
*  Brian, how did you feel about that? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=62.96s)]
*  Well, it was a pretty neat experience. I got to shake his hand. He was very personable. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, really neat experience. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  How much was the bill and how has the daily, how has the rise in prices affected you and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=75.96s)]
*  your family and your three kids? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=83.96s)]
*  The total bill was one hundred ninety four dollars and some change. And the inflation [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=86.96s)]
*  on groceries has definitely affected us. I remember in, I think it was late 2022 or early [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=93.96s)]
*  2023, I remember coming home from the grocery store and telling him, I don't even know how [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=100.96s)]
*  to budget for groceries anymore because it's like every time I go to the store, they just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=104.96s)]
*  go up and up and up. And that paired with the rising cost of energy, you know, fuel [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=108.96s)]
*  for our vehicles. It just means that we we watch a little bit more closely what we spend. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=113.96s)]
*  You know, Jenny, as I've been going back and forth to Pennsylvania, I realized that you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=120.96s)]
*  guys are quite private people. You're not. You just go, you work and you go home. You [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=125.96s)]
*  don't really like sharing your political perspectives. But as you talk with your friends [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=130.96s)]
*  out there that are experiencing the same thing, what are they telling you that they may not [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=135.96s)]
*  be telling these posters out there? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=139.96s)]
*  Just that, you know, a lot of the moms I know, we've gotten a little bit more creative with [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=143.96s)]
*  how we cook to to reduce our costs. We home make a lot of foods. We actually have a group, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=149.96s)]
*  me and a couple of girlfriends have a group that we share recipes. And yeah, that's one [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=158.96s)]
*  way that we also a couple of us have picked up little like we're stay at home moms. We [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=165.96s)]
*  picked up little side jobs just to kind of pay for those extra things. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=170.96s)]
*  Yeah, Brian. Sorry, Steve. You want to go ahead? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=174.96s)]
*  Well, I was just going to say, I bet you make bigger meals now. So you have the leftovers [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=177.96s)]
*  so you can stretch the meal that way. You know, Jenny, I got a question for you. So the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=181.96s)]
*  former president hands you 100 bucks. You know, the inclination for with a lot of people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=186.96s)]
*  would be like, well, Donald Trump just gave me that. I want to keep it, you know, as a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=192.96s)]
*  souvenir. But it's 100 bucks and your bill is 200 bucks. So for a second, did you think [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=197.96s)]
*  I'm going to keep this rather than give it to the cashier? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=202.96s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to frame it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=206.96s)]
*  So do you have the bill? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=208.96s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=210.96s)]
*  Let's see it. You got it right there? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=212.96s)]
*  One second. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=215.96s)]
*  Brian, well, she goes and gets that. So I know you own your own business. So there it is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=217.96s)]
*  You own your own business. You have three boys and all my friends that have to feed [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=222.96s)]
*  three or four boys. It's really expensive. There it is. There it is. You own your own [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=226.96s)]
*  business. Your your wife is a stay at home mom. Sounds like she's doing a good job saving [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=232.96s)]
*  you money. How do you feel about all these all these price increases, the electric bill, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=236.96s)]
*  the gas bill, the grocery bill? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=243.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, those are things that we can't control. So we have to pay it one way or the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=246.96s)]
*  other. It would definitely be nice if it was cheaper. But [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=251.96s)]
*  the place is sprinkles, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=255.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. So do you feel like they're gouging you because we hear from the vice president [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  that it's price gouging. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  No, those are completely [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  They're lies. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, Ryan has to increase his prices when everything else goes up, you know, the fuel [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=272.96s)]
*  to get the merchandise to the store, producers of the food, their prices are going up. It's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=277.96s)]
*  just the natural effect. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=284.96s)]
*  I've talked to people that own supermarkets. They are not gouging. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=286.96s)]
*  Jenny, real quickly, before we let you go, how was Donald Trump the man? I mean, so often [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=290.96s)]
*  people don't get the opportunity to meet him. Was he personal? But did you find him to be [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=294.96s)]
*  genuine or did you see something differently? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=298.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he was really personable. He was very complimentary. I mean, he called my kids [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=301.96s)]
*  perfecto, which makes any mom's heart melt. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=307.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=310.96s)]
*  Talk to which I had heard that and I can confirm the rumors are true. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=312.96s)]
*  Well, there you go. And I'm sure. Thank you very much both of you for joining us today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=317.96s)]
*  I'm sure your sons who met saw the former president will be talking in class today to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=321.96s)]
*  explain to their schools about what the former president was like. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=326.96s)]
*  Jenny and Bryant Cantz, who if you're in that neck of the woods, if you notice somebody's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2rMv69uoOI&t=329.96s)]
