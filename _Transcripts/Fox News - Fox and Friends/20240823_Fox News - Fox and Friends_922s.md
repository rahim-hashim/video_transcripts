# Lawrence Jones: These are blatant lies
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs)
*  Of course. Thank goodness this is over, right Lawrence? I mean if you stayed up to watch, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=0.0s)]
*  which I have every single night, and you wake up early, I know you, because you've been there [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=4.8s)]
*  covering it and interviewing people all day long before the convention at night and working the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=10.72s)]
*  morning show, but all these, they're all just scripted reads. You know, they're just reading [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=15.6s)]
*  from the teleprompter. Yeah, they're powerful speeches, but it's just telling their story, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=20.16s)]
*  and then here we go, slamming President Trump. The whole convention was slamming President Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  It was more about, we hate him so much, we hope you hate him more than you hate our radical record. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=30.32s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to go through the record a little later on in the program, but guys, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=38.48s)]
*  I know there's been some people to say that it was a great speech. This was great for Kamala, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=42.96s)]
*  but I don't think so, especially when you set the bar so high for two of the two, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=47.92s)]
*  two of the most popular people in the Democratic Party in Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  get this speech, you know, reach that metric of inspiration. I don't think so, and I guess the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=59.28s)]
*  part that I just cannot disconnect from this convention, and I understand spin. Both political [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  parties, they do spin. They try to, you know, push things in their favor, but there are just [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=72.56s)]
*  blatant lies that the Democratic Party is putting out there to the American people to depress the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=77.28s)]
*  vote, to change the vote, that I think needs to be called out, and I just wish more people in the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  media would call out the consistent lies from this party, guys. Right, you're not criticizing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=87.84s)]
*  Will Kaine, are you? No, no, not Will. Thank you for that clarification. Yeah, I just want to make [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=93.28s)]
*  sure. I appreciate that, because I was wondering too. I was like, Lawrence is coming in hot. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Really hot on Will. No, but Lawrence is right, and I think we began that process yesterday. We had [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=103.92s)]
*  Donald Trump on Fox and Friends. We asked him because Tim Walz began the story of, just as an [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  example, saying Donald Trump wanted to institute a national abortion ban. I believe his exact words [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  are, he wanted to enact a national abortion ban with or without Congress. That is the exact same [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=119.44s)]
*  line, word for word, that was repeated last night from the stage by Kamala Harris. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=126.16s)]
*  You can always trust me to put country above party and self, to hold sacred America's fundamental [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=133.52s)]
*  principles from the rule of law to free and fair elections. We know what a second Trump term would [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=144.88s)]
*  look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisors, and its sum total [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=153.84s)]
*  is to pull our country back to the past. We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=161.76s)]
*  Social Security and Medicare. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=171.28s)]
*  birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without Congress. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=180.16s)]
*  This is so crazy. Yeah it is. So the thing is that Donald Trump has done a lot over four years. He's been [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=190.96s)]
*  running for president three times now and he talks almost every day to any outlet, including small [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=196.56s)]
*  local outlets. Why make things up? Why say that Donald Trump's looking to jail his opponents? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  It's actually what you guys are trying to do. Why come out and say he's going to use the National [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=208.4s)]
*  Guard on his own citizens? He offered the National Guard during total civil unrest during the George [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Floyd riots and some other opportunities. So why make stuff up about Project 2025? I have news for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=218.24s)]
*  you. If people work for you and go get another job, it doesn't mean they're still working for you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=224.4s)]
*  Yes, there are some people at the Heritage Foundation, I think it's the biggest think tank [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=230.72s)]
*  in Washington, that leave Republican administrations and go work there. It doesn't mean they're still [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  working for Donald Trump. Listen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=241.28s)]
*  They know I have nothing to do with it. I had no idea what it was. A group of people got together, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=246.08s)]
*  they drew up some conservative values, very conservative values, and in some case perhaps [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=251.6s)]
*  they went over the line, perhaps they didn't. I have no idea what Project 25 is. I'm for exceptions [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=257.44s)]
*  for rape incest and the life of the mother. I'm for exceptions. Most people are for exceptions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=263.12s)]
*  You have to follow your heart. But it's being voted on and an issue that's ripped our country [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=270.24s)]
*  apart for 50 years is being solved at the voting booth and states are voting in what they want. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=276.16s)]
*  They say in the committee, I want a federal ban. I would never, they know I've said it. There will [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=284.24s)]
*  not be a federal ban. This has been fact checked. This is a lie. This is a hoax, but it's a lie over [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  and over that is being repeated. They're not stopping. They do not care about the fact check. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=295.36s)]
*  The Donald Trump campaign for president has also laid out his policy on Social Security [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=299.52s)]
*  and Medicare. We have seen his actual policies. We do not know outside of some increases in capital [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=304.08s)]
*  gains tax, for example, or price controls, what Kamala's actual policies might be to, I guess, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=310.55999999999995s)]
*  fix the economy she's been in charge of, at least in a partnership for the past three and a half [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=316.96s)]
*  years. But here's Trump, a fight and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  including changes to the retirement age. From his website, even though the Democrats are on stage [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=324.64s)]
*  saying he wants to cut it, he wants to cut your Medicare, he wants to cut your Social Security. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=329.04s)]
*  No, in fact, he's saying the check that you get from Social Security that you've already paid into [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=333.04s)]
*  and you've already been taxed for once, I'm not going to tax you on that. No tax on tips and no [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  tax on Social Security. And it's interesting to hear all of the media afterwards just praising, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  praising, praising the DNC and praising Kamala Harris when they wanted to replace her a few [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=347.04s)]
*  months ago. Remember the media headlines? New York Times said the vice president is still struggling [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=351.76s)]
*  to make the case for herself. They also reported tensions between the White House and her office. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=356.24s)]
*  Her staff members were saying the environment in her office was dysfunctional and abusive, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=361.76s)]
*  but you're not hearing that this morning. Elizabeth Warren, Lawrence, I'll let you weigh in. Go ahead. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, go ahead, Brian. I guess I was going to say, have they learned nothing? Have they learned [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=371.92s)]
*  nothing from the scandal with Joe Biden and concealing his mental decline for all of these [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=377.2s)]
*  years? All the stories that they got on background from cabinet members, people that were in the room [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=383.44s)]
*  with him, and then it blows up in your face. What's going to happen with her? Does it take [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=389.04s)]
*  another debate for it to blow up again when she can't deliver a back and forth on policy? She [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=393.68s)]
*  couldn't even handle the pro-Hamas crowd. She couldn't even stand on a position there. All she [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=400.08s)]
*  could say is, I'm speaking. I'm sorry. That's not a spirited conversation. She could have said, hey, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=404.72s)]
*  I stand with Israel in this moment. But it's as she says, I'm speaking. Is that what she's going [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=409.76s)]
*  to do when she's on the debate stage with Donald Trump and he challenges her on some of her positions [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  or says, Madam Vice President, you keep saying that I want to end Medicare. That's not true. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=418.8s)]
*  And I've said this and this and this. And why did you steal my idea on no tax on tips? I mean, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=424.24s)]
*  I just don't understand why they keep letting her get away with it. Yeah, we'll see, because it's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=429.68s)]
*  only been one voice, her voice and the Democratic voice. The honeymoon's over starting today. It's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=433.2s)]
*  because we have 74 days left. And just to build on your point, Elizabeth Warren basically called [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=437.84s)]
*  for a replacement. You got to have a replacement. And then Nancy Pelosi went and asked, she goes, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  do you think that she's a good running mate for Joe Biden? Anderson Cooper asked. He goes, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=447.84s)]
*  he thinks so. Really? And then she put her. Jamie Raskin said the same thing, couldn't even endorse [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=452.56s)]
*  her. And then Andrea Mitchell basically, well, I said, came out there who's an icon on the MSNBC [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=456.88s)]
*  platform. So this is what we know. We know that Joe Biden's failing. You wouldn't admit it. That's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=463.44s)]
*  why he kicked him out. And we know you were not for Kamala Harris two weeks ago, three weeks ago, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=469.12s)]
*  and you wouldn't admit it. But Trump also says something else. He also says, do you realize [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=474.8s)]
*  you actually have the job now? Well, the biggest reaction is why didn't she do the things that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=481.04s)]
*  she's complaining about? All of these things that she talked about, we're going to do this, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=489.52s)]
*  we're going to do that, we're going to do everything. But she didn't do any of it. She [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=494.0s)]
*  could have done it three and a half years ago. She could do it tonight by leaving the auditorium [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=497.84s)]
*  and going to Washington, D.C. and closing the border. You know, I want to address a couple of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=503.12s)]
*  things you've said, Lawrence. I think that I humbly disagree with a couple of things that you've said [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=509.44s)]
*  this morning. First, I would say this. Yes, it is going to take Donald Trump out on a debate stage [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=514.32s)]
*  to call out these inconsistencies. It will not be done in the press, and I know we agree on that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=521.84s)]
*  And it will be gotten away with from the stage of the Democratic National Convention. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=526.96s)]
*  But earlier you said she didn't achieve a level of inspiration to match that of Barack or [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  Michelle Obama. I don't think that's her bar. I actually think that speech last night did the job [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=537.84s)]
*  for Kamala. It doesn't mean I think it should have done the job. I think that she told lies that we're [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  highlighting this morning. The question is, what does a casual observer who might have been sitting [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=550.0s)]
*  out, who didn't want to vote for Donald Trump, and saw the obvious decline in Joe Biden think [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=554.72s)]
*  after last night? And I think she came out and she told a story about her own life that was appealing [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=560.88s)]
*  enough that it's going to take some real fact check to push back on. My point is her bar wasn't [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=566.0s)]
*  Obama. It was Biden. And if she in any way inspired someone who was going, you know, that guy's senile. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=571.52s)]
*  That guy shouldn't be holding office. If she anyway cleared the Biden bar, I think she did the job [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=579.52s)]
*  last night of increasing the chances for the Democratic Party. I think too that, go ahead, Lawrence. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=585.04s)]
*  Lawrence, no, no, no, I was just going to say real quickly, but does it get people to the polls, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=593.44s)]
*  though? I think what it's not just about speeches. It's about the most inspirational person that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=600.72s)]
*  rallies voters. And I think that's one thing to Obama's credit that he had. It was, you know, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  it's not just you're not in an auditorium or giving some lecture for some average day speech. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=614.96s)]
*  It has to be inspirational enough where people say, because right now, let's face it, there's a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=622.24s)]
*  lot of people that are independents that are saying, screw it, maybe I just stay at home. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=627.36s)]
*  I won't vote for any of the parties. Those are the people that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=632.24s)]
*  have to go after. Donald Trump at least has the burden of at least things were better under him. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=636.88s)]
*  And so my life depends on it. So I have to go vote for him with those independent voters. I'm not sure [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=642.24s)]
*  her speech met the message of inspiration to say, okay, I can disregard my economic state and go [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=648.48s)]
*  vote for Kamala Harris. I guess that's what I was alluding to. Go ahead. She's running on vibes and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=655.6s)]
*  running on joy. Does that translate into votes? It might. Some people might have watched this and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=661.04s)]
*  said, I'm invigorated. I like what she stands for, even though we don't really know. But I like her [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  speech. And I believe her when she spreads these lies because I don't like Trump. But then when you [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=672.96s)]
*  look at her website and you and there's no policy on there, go to kamalaharris.com. There's nothing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=678.88s)]
*  about her policy, what she stands for. Zero sit down interviews since she became a nominee. What [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=685.2s)]
*  is it's been a month. Primaries won. No one has voted for her to have this position so far. The [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=690.24s)]
*  first vote will be on November 5th. She's won zero primaries in 2020. She won zero [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=696.88s)]
*  zero primaries in 2020. She dropped out. She was the first one to drop out that December. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=704.16s)]
*  And then the next November was the election. So we watched her on the debate stage. People have said [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=708.88s)]
*  she doesn't prepare. Remember the interview when they're like, why aren't you going to the border? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=714.4s)]
*  And she said, you've never been to the border. Well, I've never been to Europe. Her answer was [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=717.92s)]
*  it was she wasn't prepared for that. And her staff has complained that she's not working hard. She's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=723.04s)]
*  not prepared. I think what's going to happen is when they have this first debate, she's going to [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=729.28s)]
*  be so prepared. She has a whole team that surrounding her that hates Donald Trump so much and they want [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=733.52s)]
*  to win so badly that she's going to be prepared at that debate. Is that going to carry her into the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=737.76s)]
*  election? If she becomes the president, then that's when you're going to see her start to fail. But [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  they won't care because and that's when she'll have to do interviews and she won't be prepared, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=748.4s)]
*  but they will not care because at that point she'll already be she would have already won. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=752.56s)]
*  Republicans are hoping that doesn't happen. They're hoping that Donald Trump wins on his record. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  Compare his record to her record. We know what her record is. Zero fracking. If you live in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=761.68s)]
*  Pennsylvania, that's a problem. Open borders. That's a problem for every single state. We're [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  not going to make them illegals. This is not a crime for them to cross our border. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=771.04s)]
*  Sanctuary cities, high taxes, her corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent raise the top income [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=775.12s)]
*  tax rate at the federal level from 37 percent to 39.6 percent. This is going to hurt companies. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=782.24s)]
*  Highest tax bracket are people who own these big corporations and companies and hire a bunch of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=788.08s)]
*  people. Right. Meanwhile, Peter Ducey found his way into the bowels of the United Center and found [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=792.32s)]
*  the vice president and her husband Doug Emhoff right before she got on stage. Listen, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=798.32s)]
*  Madam Vice President, congratulations. Are you ready for your Fox News interview? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=805.9200000000001s)]
*  So I mean they knew each other for when she was a senator, so that was nice for her to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  give those few words, but she did promise. You think she'll do it? You think she'll do a Fox [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=820.0s)]
*  News interview? Well, I don't think it'll be a first and I don't think it'll be ever. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=823.68s)]
*  The more I think about it, she said she'll do an interview before the- The more I think about it [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=828.64s)]
*  in those 30 seconds. Right, two seconds. But she says she's going to do an interview before [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=832.2399999999999s)]
*  the end of the month. So that's next week. It'll be friendly and I'm a little bit surprised they'll [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=837.1999999999999s)]
*  do it. Look, the thing that I'm voicing to you, Lawrence, and that I think Ainsley built upon is [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=841.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm afraid there are a lot of people out there that will vote on joy and vibes and they should [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  not. And they will even vote against their own interest. They will vote against inflation hurting [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=853.2s)]
*  their own pocketbook. And it is inexplicable and they leaned into it. And you can lean into it from [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=857.84s)]
*  a stage. You can't lean into it in an interview. You can't lean into it during a debate and you [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  actually can't lean into it when you're interacting one-on-one with voters. I'm going to risk losing [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=867.84s)]
*  Ainsley, but hopefully- There's nothing better I heard than going to a pep rally before a Notre [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=871.84s)]
*  Dame football game. The whole crowd goes crazy. The whole school is there. And then you- Alumni's [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=877.2s)]
*  there. And they got to go out, put the eye black on, and they got to play. The game starts today. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=881.28s)]
*  Right. The vibes were great, but once the gloves come off- I can follow that. You did not lose me. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  I know what that means. See, Lawrence? I grew up in college football. That's all I have to do. I had [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  to make eye contact and explain it slowly. So that's when the game starts today, guys. I agree. So- [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=895.28s)]
*  Actually after Labor Day. People say after Labor Day. The Northeast is not even back in school. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=900.64s)]
*  People are taking their last vacations of the summer right now. Right. I think you're generalizing. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=904.56s)]
*  Lawrence. I think there's a lot of people working next week. I think after Labor Day. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4QL9jcXFvs&t=908.56s)]
