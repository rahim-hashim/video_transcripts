# Harris ‘ushered in’ these radical policies: Former San Francisco cop
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA)
*  I was an elected attorney general and before that an elected district attorney. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=0.0s)]
*  And before that, and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=9.88s)]
*  So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=17.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris leaning into her prosecutor roots on the trail you hear it all the time [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=25.8s)]
*  as she heads back to San Francisco today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  But under her leadership as district attorney of San Francisco, she declined to pursue the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=33.08s)]
*  death penalty for a gang member who murdered a cop, instead punishing parents for kids [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  truancy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Then as attorney general, she stayed silent on the passage of Prop 47, which downgraded [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  felonies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=50.24s)]
*  Former San Francisco police officer Joel Aylworth joins us now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=51.72s)]
*  Joel, you were a police officer in San Francisco, which means you lived with the reality of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=56.36s)]
*  policies of the climate of the time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=61.92s)]
*  You lived through it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=64.28s)]
*  We can go back and look at stats. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=65.64s)]
*  We can talk about it and analyze it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=67.28s)]
*  You were there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=68.84s)]
*  What was San Francisco like when Kamala Harris was the district attorney and what impact [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  you believe she had on that environment? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=75.56s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Pete. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=77.48s)]
*  And not only that, I actually lived there for 10 years in the city. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=79.36s)]
*  So I felt it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=82.48s)]
*  My family felt it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=83.96s)]
*  And it was one of the reasons we had to move. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=85.36s)]
*  I remember telling my kids, you know, they would ask me every time we'd go to the parks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=86.8s)]
*  is you know, dad, why are there so many broken car windows? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=89.92s)]
*  Why are there so many homeless? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=92.68s)]
*  Why are there so many needles on the ground? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=94.16s)]
*  And so these are the things I face just daily as a dad, a husband, a father. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  But from the crime standpoint, let's face it, Kamala ushered in George Gascon, who then [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  ushered in Chesapeake Dean and these radical progressive policies have been with San Francisco [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=107.36s)]
*  for a long, long time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=111.72s)]
*  And so cops know from the cops perspective, there was almost no point in arresting certain [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  folks because you knew they were just going to get out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=119.6s)]
*  They were going to get out the next day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  I know guys, for example, that would arrest drug dealers and see them by the end of their [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=123.44s)]
*  shift. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=127.35999999999999s)]
*  They would see them in there and then within the 10 hours of the shift, let go and freeze. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  So this was kind of the morale and the attitude just surrounding San Francisco. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=131.4s)]
*  You see it playing out today. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=135.72s)]
*  So she really was kind of the forerunner, the original Soros type prosecutor who didn't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=137.8s)]
*  believe in, wanted to let people go sort of on the side of the criminals, give them a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=144.72s)]
*  second chance. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=149.84s)]
*  But what that meant for average folks is crimes go unprosecuted and people get released back [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=150.84s)]
*  in and the environment gets worse. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=155.8s)]
*  Hey, listen, I'm about results. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=157.76s)]
*  And so when you like you said, let's not look at the data, but let's look at the data, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=160.32s)]
*  I mean, she oversaw California this whole time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=164.28s)]
*  She had a chance to talk about Prop 47. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  That was all under her reign. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=169.46s)]
*  And we saw for a long, long time, the homeless, we see shoplifting right now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  It's at a 25 year peak in California. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  Violent crime is one of the highest it has been compared to the rest of the country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  And so, yeah, she she essentially was one of the spearheaders, if you will. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=182.96s)]
*  There was also a particular four months into her tenure, she declined to charge a gang [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=188.12s)]
*  member who killed a cop. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=192.32s)]
*  And there was a huge backlash to that, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=194.56s)]
*  Yeah, that was a big death blow for the the San Francisco Police Department. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=197.4s)]
*  And listen, the reality is probably that would have never got charged anyways in a liberal [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=202.0s)]
*  state like California. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=206.76s)]
*  And I don't think it's been charged in a long, long time. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=208.08s)]
*  And it was with if we look at historically. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=210.16s)]
*  But what happened was within her first four months, she never even consulted the family. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=212.52s)]
*  And within her first press conference, she immediately said, hey, I'm not going to do [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=217.88s)]
*  that. And I think a lot of SFPD and some of the higher ups as well as the POA, a lot [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=221.44s)]
*  of them were stunned. And if you look right now, even Isaac's Isaac Espinoza, his wife [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  till this day has never gotten an apology. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=232.32s)]
*  And even she was surprised that it went down that way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=233.96s)]
*  So it was really just a matter of etiquette, I would say, is the most important thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=236.56s)]
*  And, you know, you always have a chance to to go back and do the courageous thing and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=240.4s)]
*  apologize. And that's never happened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=244.44s)]
*  Interesting. We're going to learn more a lot more about this record, at least here, the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=246.56s)]
*  compliant press mostly won't bring it up if they if they dig it all. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=251.04s)]
*  Joel, thank you so much for your service and your time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate it. Pleasure. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=257.12s)]
*  Thanks, Pete. Good to see you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qvuMW0PsA&t=258.8s)]
