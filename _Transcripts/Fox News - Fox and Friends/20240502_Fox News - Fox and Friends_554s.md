# Democrat challenged on Biden's response to anti-Israel campus mobs
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA)
*  We want to bring in Democratic Congressman, Ivy League alumni, Congressman Josh Gottheimer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=0.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=4.4s)]
*  Congressman, I know you've been seeing what's going to be going on and you've been noticing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=5.4s)]
*  what's been happening on college campuses over the last six or seven weeks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=8.52s)]
*  Your thoughts about this takedown in UCLA? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=12.84s)]
*  I think number one priority for everyone should be to make sure that law enforcement and the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=15.44s)]
*  students are safe. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=21.36s)]
*  And that's the key to me to make sure everyone is safe on campus. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=23.26s)]
*  And also to make sure our campuses can, for all the students who are not participating [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=25.92s)]
*  in this, to make sure it's safe, not just for them, but also they can go to class, they [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=30.6s)]
*  can graduate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=36.040000000000006s)]
*  They're off today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=37.040000000000006s)]
*  The key here is to make sure our campuses are safe. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=38.040000000000006s)]
*  From what you're seeing now, are you outraged that any type of major university would allow [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=40.92s)]
*  this to get to that point? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, I mean, I was at Columbia a week ago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=46.96s)]
*  I've been watching what's going on at all these universities. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=50.96s)]
*  I think, of course, we should all be outraged about what's going on and deeply concerned. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=52.64s)]
*  And I think that's why we fought so hard and we're proud of yesterday passing key bipartisan [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=59.08s)]
*  legislation, clearly defining anti-Semitism, ensuring that you can't have anyone on campus [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=65.2s)]
*  feel like they are not welcome there and being harassed and intimidated. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=71.76s)]
*  And I think that's a critical part of this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=77.0s)]
*  there is a way to have civil discourse on campus and debate issues. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=80.04s)]
*  This is clearly not the way to do that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=84.4s)]
*  And I'm glad you mentioned that you are the co-sponsor of the anti-Semitism bill, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=86.64s)]
*  passed in the House yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=92.94000000000001s)]
*  It's got an uncertain future in the Senate as it progresses. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=95.76s)]
*  But as you look at, we know that, you know, so I know whose side you're on. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=99.68s)]
*  You know whose side we're on when it comes to these protesters and the anti-Semitism [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=107.84s)]
*  that is sweeping the nation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  But you know, there's a large group of House Democrats who don't see the protest as anti-Semitic [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  and some of your younger, more progressive Democratic colleagues actually back the protests. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=119.92s)]
*  When they attack the cops, it's hard to do that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=127.12s)]
*  Well, obviously, no one should attack law enforcement and we can't stand idly by and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=130.2s)]
*  what we're seeing these images are deeply disturbing, you know, and as it was deeply [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=135.6s)]
*  disturbing and I've seen videos, I'm sure you have people calling for the deaths of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=139.4s)]
*  Jews and screaming supporting Hamas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=144.14s)]
*  We're all Hamas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=147.72s)]
*  All of that is something that I just can't believe is happening on our college campuses. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=149.16s)]
*  So there were people yesterday, by the way, the people, Democrats and Republicans, who [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  I was shocked voted against the anti-Semitism bill yesterday. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=159.04s)]
*  The bottom line is why did they do that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=163.18s)]
*  Scott, why did they do that? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=164.76s)]
*  Like, Nagler? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=165.76s)]
*  Why did they vote against it? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=166.76s)]
*  You know, there were questions about commas and definitions and I don't think that there [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  was any question about that legislation of what it meant, which was that we should of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  course be able to criticize, you should of course protect free speech in this great country, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  but there's a huge difference between harassing and intimidating and discrimination, which [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=185.28s)]
*  shouldn't be allowed on our college campuses against anyone and I think and hate shouldn't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=191.56s)]
*  be allowed on our college campuses. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=196.48s)]
*  There's a difference again between civil discourse and debate, which we should encourage on our [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=197.96s)]
*  college campuses even when we don't agree and what you're seeing now going on. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=201.68s)]
*  So Congressman, I have to ask, you guys just accomplished bipartisan legislation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=205.28s)]
*  Good job. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=210.44s)]
*  And we're watching, not just here at UCLA, but scenes like this happening on college [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=211.44s)]
*  campuses all across the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=217.32s)]
*  You got our Jewish brothers and sisters that feel like they're under attack. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=219.4s)]
*  You got the FBI saying that 60% of the hate crimes are against their community. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Don't you think it's time that we hear from President Biden an address to the country? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=226.96s)]
*  You have the FBI, I'm sorry, the NYPD counterterrorism said that our students are being radicalized [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=232.52s)]
*  by outside factors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=238.52s)]
*  Why haven't we heard from our commander in chief on this matter? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=240.82s)]
*  Well, I believe that the president is speaking this coming week. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=244.28s)]
*  He's going to the Holocaust Museum, by the way, where I was last night. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=247.8s)]
*  We led a group of tour with Democrats and Republicans, which I think punctuated the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=251.0s)]
*  importance of the legislation yesterday. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  So I think the White House has been pretty clear and the president has been pretty clear [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=257.68s)]
*  about his outrage here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=261.24s)]
*  But not a statement, Congressman. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=262.48s)]
*  I don't mean to interrupt you, Congressman. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=264.48s)]
*  May 7th? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  But what about not just something that is on a sheet of paper and through his aides, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  but addressing the country right now? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=273.2s)]
*  We can't wait until that event. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=275.84s)]
*  We have outrage happening right now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=279.2s)]
*  Listen, he's obviously, I believe, going to have a very important speech this coming week. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=281.32s)]
*  And I expect that given what's going on, you'll hear from him even sooner. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=287.12s)]
*  I think we need to hear from every leader in our country right now about standing up [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=291.68s)]
*  to hate and discrimination to make it very clear that this is not acceptable. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  And there's a way to, again, there's a way to disagree. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=301.8s)]
*  Should you say that to the squad? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=306.16s)]
*  Unacceptable. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=307.64s)]
*  Should you say that to the squad privately, that you're on the wrong side of this and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=308.64s)]
*  it's not, it's against Jews and against Americans? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=313.44s)]
*  Well, I've not been private. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=316.52s)]
*  I've been pretty public about my outrage overall and my deep concern about what's going on [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=319.32s)]
*  and not just on college campuses, but overall the way people are talking about, frankly, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=327.08s)]
*  hate toward anyone. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=332.68s)]
*  And I think, again, that should be our message, that discrimination on college campuses is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=334.64s)]
*  unacceptable, hate of this kind and targeted hate is unacceptable. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=339.36s)]
*  And that, again, there is a way to disagree on college campuses and debate issues. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  This is not how you handle things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=348.5s)]
*  You don't scream and harass and punch other kids and scream for Zionists to die. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  That is not the way we should handle it in this country and on college campuses. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=357.56s)]
*  Scott, you were talking about leaders. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=360.64s)]
*  We did hear from former President Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=362.48s)]
*  He just had a truth social post about it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=364.68s)]
*  Also, we heard from Speaker Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=367.56s)]
*  A couple of days ago, he announced a house-wide investigation into anti-Semitism on campus [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=371.76s)]
*  and he was surrounded at that press event by Republicans. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  Will there be Democrats like you who would also join the speaker on the investigation [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=382.24s)]
*  into anti-Semitism at places like UCLA and your alma mater, Harvard and UPenn? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=386.6s)]
*  I've been looking at this for months and actually speaking on this for years. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=393.32s)]
*  I've made it clear to the speaker that this, what he's doing, this initiative here is important. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=400.52s)]
*  You heard from our leader, Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic leader, speak out clearly against [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=407.23999999999995s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=411.23999999999995s)]
*  He did it yesterday again, against what's going on on college campuses and against anti-Semitism. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=412.23999999999995s)]
*  He's been very clear. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=418.0s)]
*  Our leadership and our party yesterday came out strong supporting the legislation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=419.6s)]
*  I don't think there's any daylight here between my views and our leadership's views on what [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=423.6s)]
*  we need to do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=428.6s)]
*  I think this should again be bipartisan. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=429.6s)]
*  There should be nothing partisan about standing up to anti-Semitism. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=431.6s)]
*  That is true. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=435.6s)]
*  You've been in the lead and you deserve tremendous credit for that, but that comes instinctively [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=436.6s)]
*  for you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=439.6s)]
*  What surprised me, and you know him better, is Chuck Schumer, the highest ranking Jewish [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=440.6s)]
*  American in the history of our country, has said one thing at Columbia when they took [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=445.6s)]
*  over the building, but for the most part you can't hear a word, you don't hear a word from [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=450.6s)]
*  him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=454.6s)]
*  This guy never saw a camera he didn't like. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8yyR3cjtIA&t=455.6s)]
