# Trump, Speaker Johnson secure MAJOR victory in passing 'big, beautiful bill'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI)
*  We're being told that Speaker Johnson is speaking right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=0.0s)]
*  The big beautiful bill just passed. Stand by. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=2.64s)]
*  And make government work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=6.04s)]
*  House Democrats voted against all of that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=10.96s)]
*  So everything that I just said, they voted the opposite. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=12.96s)]
*  Clearly proves they actually they must want the largest tax increase [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=16.16s)]
*  in U.S. history on the American citizens. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=19.6s)]
*  They must want open borders. They've proven that over and over. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=21.56s)]
*  They must. They want must want Medicaid for illegal immigrants. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=24.48s)]
*  We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once in a generation legislation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=29.12s)]
*  We stand ready to continue our work together to deliver on the one big, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=33.88s)]
*  beautiful bill as President Trump named it himself. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  We're going to send that to his desk. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  We're going to get there by Independence Day on July 4th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  And we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=45.84s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=49.36s)]
*  We yield next to our leader, Steve Scalise. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=55.08s)]
*  And as the speaker said, it truly is morning in America again. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=56.36s)]
*  You know, when you think about all of the work that's gone in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=62.0s)]
*  to putting this bill together, it's one big, beautiful bill for a lot of reasons. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=65.88s)]
*  There are a lot of really important wins for the American people in this bill. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=70.88s)]
*  And we had 11 committees come together. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=76.76s)]
*  And meet in hearings, someone on over 24 hours. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=80.68s)]
*  Rules committee went over 20 hours. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=85.28s)]
*  You had, you know, of course, the Budget Committee. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=89.28s)]
*  Chairman Errington is the lead author of the bill. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=91.64s)]
*  All of the people that had to come together in our conference. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=94.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of you know, we don't all think alike. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=97.92s)]
*  Democrats made it very clear they didn't want to have any part [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=102.2s)]
*  in helping get America back on track again. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=106.44s)]
*  But we were never deterred when this bill could have failed ten times over. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  We said we were going to get this done and failure is not an option. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=114.88s)]
*  And we meant it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=118.92s)]
*  We knew we were fighting for the families who have been struggling for way too long [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=120.36s)]
*  under the failed policies of Joe Biden and all the Democrats who did have control [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=125.2s)]
*  of Washington for too long. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=130.04s)]
*  We watched higher interest rates and higher inflation and lower wages. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=132.32s)]
*  And a demise of the American dream that we knew should not be permanent, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=137.48s)]
*  but was only going to turn around if we passed a bill to get America back on track. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=143.48s)]
*  We knew we had to prevent a massive tax increase. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=149.0s)]
*  So we put it in the bill. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=151.8s)]
*  We knew we needed to secure America's border as President Trump ran on all [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=153.8s)]
*  across this country and won the election on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=159.24s)]
*  And we put it in this bill. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=161.48s)]
*  We ran on and said we would produce more American energy and we put it in this bill. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=164.36s)]
*  All the things that we knew we needed to do to root out waste, fraud and abuse in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  government, focus on those families who are struggling. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=175.96s)]
*  All of that is in this one big, beautiful bill. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=179.52s)]
*  And yes, now the House has come together and passed this bill against all odds. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=182.44s)]
*  But we're still working on the rest of the process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=188.96s)]
*  Still goes to the Senate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=192.8s)]
*  Senate has a lot of work to do too. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  That's why we've been talking to the Senate for a long time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=196.44s)]
*  But it's their turn to take this bill and move forward. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=199.76s)]
*  But I'll tell you, none of this would be possible without the leadership of President [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump, who every step of the way, not only laid out the vision, ran a campaign on this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=206.44s)]
*  vision, but every step of the way to said, whatever you need, let me know. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=213.72s)]
*  And he was there to help us. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=219.32s)]
*  Our great speaker, Mike Johnson, who was never deterred, probably hasn't slept in a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=221.64s)]
*  few days, but never wavered in his commitment to get this done. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=226.64s)]
*  And this whole team has come together and our whip has never relented and never stopped [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  pushing to get this done. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=240.6s)]
*  With that, I bring up our great majority whip, Tom Emmer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=243.32s)]
*  Thank you, Steve. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=253.6s)]
*  On November 5th, the American people rejected the failed policies of the Biden [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=254.48s)]
*  Harris administration and overwhelmingly endorsed President Trump's America First [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=259.36s)]
*  Agenda. Using his executive authority, President Trump hit the ground running on [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=264.8s)]
*  day one to deliver on the promises he made to the American people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=269.4s)]
*  Today, House Republicans followed suit. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=273.8s)]
*  Our one big, beautiful bill fulfills the mandate for change we were given last [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=277.08s)]
*  November. It allows President Trump to continue his successful border security [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=281.92s)]
*  and deportation operations by investing in more border patrol agents and ICE [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  officers, funding the continuation of the border wall and equipping our men and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=292.32s)]
*  women on the front lines with the tools they need to keep us safe. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=297.48s)]
*  Not only will the one big, beautiful bill help to make America. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=301.44s)]
*  Let's get right to Aisha Hines, live outside the Capitol. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  She's going to break down what's inside the big, beautiful bill. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Good morning, Aisha. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=311.2s)]
*  Hey, good morning to you guys. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=312.68s)]
*  What a victory for House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=313.8s)]
*  We have not yet heard from him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=317.76s)]
*  I'm sort of scrolling through his truth social, waiting to see if he is going to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=319.16s)]
*  make some remarks about this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=323.76s)]
*  But it's a huge day for both of these men to celebrate. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=325.44s)]
*  This was his signature piece of legislation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=329.16s)]
*  It was not an easy task. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=332.16s)]
*  We're talking about over a thousand pages of bill text. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=334.4s)]
*  There's a lot in here that President Trump is very excited about, and they got [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=337.6s)]
*  it done even though there were some moments there where we weren't sure if [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=342.96s)]
*  they were going to have the votes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=345.92s)]
*  They got it done. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=347.24s)]
*  They were here all night. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=348.08s)]
*  So they are going to be celebrating now. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=349.2s)]
*  Nothing motivates Congress more than President Trump and a nice, long holiday [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=351.04s)]
*  weekend like Memorial Day weekend. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=355.88s)]
*  They wanted to get out of here, so they'll be able to do that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=357.44s)]
*  So let's talk about what's in this because it does impact you at home. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=360.0s)]
*  If you pay taxes, this is a big deal for you because it makes permanent those [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=364.0s)]
*  Trump 2017 tax cuts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=368.76s)]
*  That means that your taxes will not be going up next year. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=371.32s)]
*  This impacts more than 60 percent of Americans across the country. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=374.64s)]
*  A lot of Democrats were making a fuss about how this was a big payout for the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=378.96s)]
*  billionaires. I don't think that more than 60 percent of Americans are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=383.0s)]
*  billionaires. So it impacts the middle class and hardworking folks out there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=386.28s)]
*  Of course, some signature things from his campaign trail he talked about was [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=390.96s)]
*  no taxes on tips. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=394.64s)]
*  That's in there. No taxes on overtime. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  That's in there as well. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=398.68s)]
*  Border security, more funding to hire more and more ICE agents to continue [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=400.0s)]
*  President Trump's deportation policies. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=405.64s)]
*  They went after waste, fraud and abuse to try to make up for that loss in revenue [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  when it came to those taxes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=412.88s)]
*  A lot of fighting we saw over the past couple of weeks. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=414.44s)]
*  You heard a lot about salt for those folks that live in red states. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=418.12s)]
*  This is a big deal for blue state folks that that pay a lot of money in property [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=422.48s)]
*  taxes. You had a lot of Republicans from places like New York, New Jersey that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=428.36s)]
*  were fighting for this and they were able to raise that from 10,000 to 40,000. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  It was a huge compromise in the last couple of hours before this vote. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=437.12s)]
*  And of course, as well as raising the debt ceiling to four trillion dollars, this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=441.16s)]
*  was a big deal for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessitt because he was a little [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=446.16s)]
*  anxious that these guys weren't going to be able to get it done by the time that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=450.12s)]
*  they needed to before the August recess. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  So that's a big deal for the White House as well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=456.04s)]
*  And Medicaid, a lot of fighting over Medicaid, especially for some [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=458.88000000000005s)]

*  Freedom Caucus chair, vote present. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=490.32s)]

*  floor. They have this tool called the Magic Minute. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFg5jCgVXrI&t=509.04s)]
