**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg)
*  I'll turning to Columbia University where protests continue for a 13th day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=0.0s)]
*  Students now demanding the university divest from companies that do business [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=4.32s)]
*  with Israel. Brian Yannis is at Columbia and joins us now. Brian. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=8.88s)]
*  Good morning in Columbia University. This is where it all began. Those [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=14.32s)]
*  students are not only demanding divestment, they're also demanding [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  universal amnesty. They don't want to receive any punishment or discipline [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=21.52s)]
*  from the university at all period for participating in these protests. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=26.04s)]
*  The university is asking students to self identify themselves in a test to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=30.68s)]
*  following university rules in the future. But even that is not something [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=35.2s)]
*  the protesters seem willing to do. Columbia University President Manu [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=39.12s)]
*  Shafik has promised the protesters there won't be any lockdowns or evictions [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=42.68s)]
*  of the encampment and vowed the NYPD will not be called on the campus again [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  to make arrests. The university says negotiations are ongoing with the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=51.36s)]
*  protesters and who promised to continue to protest until Columbia fully divest [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=55.4s)]
*  its $14 billion endowment from companies associated with Israel while also [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=60.4s)]
*  severing academic ties with institutions in Tel Aviv. Over the weekend, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=65.32s)]
*  Senate minority minority leader Mitch McConnell had this to say about the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=69.92s)]
*  growing protests nationwide. What needs to happen, at least at the beginning, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=74.4s)]
*  is these university presidents need to get control of the situation, allow [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=79.28s)]
*  free speech and push back against anti Semitism. I thought that was largely [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  gone in this country, but we've seen a number of young people who are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=90.32s)]
*  actually anti Semitic. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  It's almost as if the university here at Columbia is trying to run out the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=99.56s)]
*  clock. Last day of classes today. Final exams begin Friday. They want this all [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=102.6s)]
*  settled for the on campus commencement ceremony on May 15th guys and bring [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  some spots have talked about not having commencement, not having graduation [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  because of the fear of that. You've got to figure if they do have an in person [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  commencement, there's gonna be disruptions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=121.36s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. And this encampment is right across from where this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=125.92s)]
*  commencement happens. It's a huge. It's in the same exact courtyard. So that is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=130.02s)]
*  gonna be the situation here. I think the university obviously wants these [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=134.68s)]
*  negotiations to be complete before then. But even then, even with what [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=138.2s)]
*  good is their word, what you know, any protest, you can go up there and cause [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=142.36s)]
*  a disruption. So we'll see what happens. Thanks, Brian. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04RZdvxxqg&t=146.0s)]
