# 'PUBLICITY STUNT': Newark mayor 'knew what he was doing,' NJ candidate says #shorts #us #ice #broder
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw)
*  It was a clear publicity stunt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=0.0s)]
*  And what's really sad about this is that Ross Barocca is the mayor of Newark, one of the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=2.92s)]
*  toughest cities in New Jersey. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=8.82s)]
*  This guy did this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=11.34s)]
*  He knew what he was doing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=12.64s)]
*  What's really sad about the current state of the Democratic Party is, this might actually [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  catapult him to front-runner status. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=18.38s)]
*  He could win the nomination because of this stunt. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=21.02s)]
*  We have got every Democrat out there supporting the sanctuary state, supporting the last eight [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=23.82s)]
*  years of Phil Murphy, supporting Joe Biden and the open border policy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  So I think this is a real indicator of how the Democrats are just completely out of touch [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=33.36s)]
*  with the average American and certainly the average New Jerseyan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzCAY68yKsw&t=39.04s)]
