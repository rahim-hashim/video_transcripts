# Lara Trump: Democrats have stopped focusing on ‘common sense’ #foxnews #shorts #politics #newyork
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU)
*  He said, look, it's common sense. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=0.0s)]
*  People are worried about making sure that they can afford their homes, making sure they [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=1.72s)]
*  have a great life for their kids. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=5.76s)]
*  They want the basics. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=7.62s)]
*  And I think his idea is much like a lot of people, which is that the Democrats have stopped [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=8.92s)]
*  focusing on common sense and the basics. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=14.08s)]
*  They have gone so far left and become so radical that so many people who once considered themselves [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=16.68s)]
*  like himself a lifelong Democrat say, I can't be a part of this party anymore. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=21.52s)]
*  And so it's sort of interesting to see him say that now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCIEAvaH7mU&t=27.24s)]
