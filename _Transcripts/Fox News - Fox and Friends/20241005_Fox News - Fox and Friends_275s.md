# Biden admin has been ‘behind the ball from day one’: Chad Wolf
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk)
*  President Biden warning that he'll have to ask Congress for more money to respond to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=0.0s)]
*  Helene thanks to quote unforeseen costs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=7.2s)]
*  I think I know what those are. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=10.36s)]
*  As Homeland Security says it does not have the funds to see Americans through the hurricane [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=12.68s)]
*  season. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=18.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans are ripping FEMA for spending $1.4 billion to address the needs [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=19.04s)]
*  of illegals instead of preparing for storm relief. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=24.66s)]
*  Former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf is here to react. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=28.32s)]
*  Chad it's great to have you on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean this frustration is being felt by every American. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=34.44s)]
*  What can you tell us about how money was raided from FEMA? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=38.44s)]
*  Yeah, well let me start off by just saying my heart goes out to the folks in North Carolina, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=43.08s)]
*  Georgia and elsewhere impacted. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=48.8s)]
*  Look I think what you see from this administration and DHS specifically is that they've taken [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  their eye off the ball and the ball being their primary mission of disaster relief. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=56.52s)]
*  They have instituted a new grant program over the last couple of years that gives away billions [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  of dollars to migrants to facilitate this crisis along the border. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=66.92s)]
*  And so as you divert FEMA resources from that, you divert them from their primary primary [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=72.4s)]
*  mission which is disaster relief. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=77.72s)]
*  But for the secretary to be on his way to North Carolina to try to provide some reassurance [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=79.92s)]
*  to those impacted to say that FEMA is out of money is just it's I can't believe that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=85.56s)]
*  that comment that he would make that comment because one it's not what you say to disaster [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  survivors. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=95.4s)]
*  Two it's not true. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=96.4s)]
*  FEMA has got over 21 billion dollars available to them right now to help folks down in North [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=97.4s)]
*  Carolina and elsewhere. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  And so what it feels to me is another another shift of responsibility. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=106.12s)]
*  They're trying to shift it back to Congress when it's their responsibility this this slow [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  recovery. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=113.8s)]
*  They've been behind the ball from day one and I think it's a it's an attack to shift [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=115.2s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=120.96s)]
*  So Chad are you telling me FEMA at this moment has 21 billion dollars but now they're going [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=121.96s)]
*  to Congress and saying we don't have enough money. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=126.08s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=129.48s)]
*  And the CR the continuing resolution passed about a week ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=130.48s)]
*  Congress gave FEMA access to 21 billion dollars in the disaster relief fund. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=134.52s)]
*  So they have access to that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=141.24s)]
*  So I have no idea what the secretary means when he says he's out of money. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=142.52s)]
*  Now he could be out of money come January or February. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=146.24s)]
*  But that is not where we sit today here in October where FEMA has all the funding they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=149.24s)]
*  need to address the crisis there in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and elsewhere. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=154.28s)]
*  You know it's just such a slap in the face. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  I just saw that Secretary Blinken over the last day or two said he bragged about having [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=160.88s)]
*  giving giving one hundred and fifty seven million dollars to Lebanon. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=166.8s)]
*  I just saw some videos of Susan Powers talking. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=171.16s)]
*  She's touring all the infrastructure projects she's you know we're paying for some I'm [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=174.52s)]
*  sorry Samantha Powers that she's touring all the infrastructure projects in Ukraine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  We're paying the pension funds of people in Ukraine and we can't help our own citizens. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  You talked about the primary mission of FEMA. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=189.24s)]
*  How about the primary mission of the government to serve our people? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=191.36s)]
*  Yeah that's exactly right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  America first right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=197.52s)]
*  Let's help Americans first and foremost. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=198.52s)]
*  And so when the vice president talks about seven hundred and fifty dollars to help those [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=200.64s)]
*  folks in North Carolina and elsewhere it's just it's completely tone deaf. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=204.96s)]
*  It's tone deaf in the sense of the and you talked about it the millions of dollars that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  you're giving overseas to other countries when in fact our country is now in distress [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=211.76s)]
*  and there's Americans that are feeling this here at home. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=218.12s)]
*  And to say that you're out of money or to say you're only providing seven hundred and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=221.12s)]
*  fifty dollars is terrible. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Chad should FEMA be privatized. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=226.04s)]
*  Would that make things better. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't know that that is the answer. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=231.6s)]
*  I think this comes back to leadership. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=233.2s)]
*  This comes back to making sure that you got the leaders in the right place. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=234.6s)]
*  FEMA was obviously operated very differently under President Trump and I was a part of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=238.2s)]
*  that for a period of time making sure that you pre deploy assets and resources down [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=242.76s)]
*  there. And there's a variety of different things that could be done differently. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=248.4s)]
*  So I think this this comes down to leadership in my book. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=254.88s)]
*  Well it's cold comfort for those in North Carolina at this moment. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  So thank you so much Chad. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=260.24s)]
*  Really really great having you on and getting your perspective. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCz81_EHyk&t=262.04s)]
