# Expert calls to shut down Biden’s ‘woke’ ‘nonsense’ in fiery interview
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg)
*  The Biden administration has taken more action on climate change than any other president, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=0.0s)]
*  allocating billions in funds for programs like reducing greenhouse gas, expanding EV [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=5.92s)]
*  chargers, pushing for clean school buses, and going off the grid. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=11.42s)]
*  So what should the top priorities be for the Trump administration to roll back the costly [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  climate agenda? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=20.6s)]
*  Joining us now is Mark Morano. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  He's the publisher of climatedepo.com. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=23.96s)]
*  Mark, it's always great to have you on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=27.72s)]
*  So you were on our friend Joe Piscopo's show sort of fantasizing about having the shortest [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=29.24s)]
*  lived federal job, two weeks for you to go and clean out all these wasteful climate directives [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=34.92s)]
*  and policies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=41.48s)]
*  So tell us what you would do in those two weeks, how you would advise President Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=42.48s)]
*  to deal with all this waste and climate directives. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=47.08s)]
*  Well from the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, to the Pentagon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  In fact, Biden made every climate agency a climate agency. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=56.04s)]
*  My fantasy was to have the shortest lived job in federal history, go in for about two [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  weeks, shorter than some Trump's previous press secretaries, but we won't get into that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=63.52s)]
*  But go in and literally defund and close all of the woke climate programs, particularly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=68.4s)]
*  starting in places like the Navy or in the Pentagon Department of Army, where they actually [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  have all these climate initiatives and they actually have the mission of the Army and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=80.36s)]
*  the Navy as one of their focuses is going after fighting climate change, which by the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  way isn't a thing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  There's no such thing as climate action or fighting climate change. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=90.12s)]
*  Even the Department of Transportation, in Obama's department, they had studies looking [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  at how fatal car crashes went up due to global warming. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=98.64s)]
*  You have to cut the funding, you have to cut the programs, you have to fire the employees [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=101.92s)]
*  at the very least since you can't, hard to fire people, reassign them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  I would love to preside over that, shut all this nonsense down, the most egregious examples, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=109.56s)]
*  and then walk away from federal service, because that's what needs to be done, is they have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=115.0s)]
*  to be shut immediately. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=119.28s)]
*  But even beyond that, Rachel, so much of this is the narrative in recasting this entire [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=121.48s)]
*  global fight. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=126.92s)]
*  But of course, the biggest of all, and this has to come from Donald Trump, he has to submit [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=127.92s)]
*  the UN Paris Agreement, the climate pact to the United States Senate as a treaty, get [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=132.08s)]
*  the Senate to reject it and treat it as a treaty. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=137.76s)]
*  And then that gets us out of not only that agreement, but of the entire UN climate process [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=140.92s)]
*  going back to 1992, when George H.W. Bush got us into the whole mess at the Rio Earth [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=145.76s)]
*  Summit in 1992, because he wanted Republicans to appear earth friendly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=151.42s)]
*  So he gets us involved in this UN sustainable development mess. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=156.06s)]
*  It's time for Donald Trump 2.0 to reverse, what was that, 32 years ago, that mess that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=160.26s)]
*  began, 33 years ago. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  You also said that you want to set up, you want Donald Trump to set up a sort of new [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  climate committee that would include scientists who are skeptics of this so-called science. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=172.96s)]
*  This is frustrating because Trump 1.0, the first term, he brought in the premier expert [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=181.12s)]
*  on greenhouse gases, Dr. Will Happer from Princeton University. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  He was Trump's science advisor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=189.36s)]
*  He was all set to do the first pushback on the UN climate reports, which began in 1990 [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=191.1s)]
*  by any government, any government around the world. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=198.1s)]
*  The first pushback scientifically going to have several dozen of the world's top scientists, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  including former UN scientists, Nobel Prize winning scientists, former NASA scientists, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=206.42s)]
*  Harvard and Yale scientists, all were prepared to go. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=211.66s)]
*  Donald Trump greenlit it, but his staff slow walked it till it was too late to do before [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=214.94s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=220.02s)]
*  This time around, if he does this climate committee and you have the sort of red team, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  blue team, it will be the first ever by a government pushback of the UN climate report. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=225.86s)]
*  This would be the shot heard around the world, be the first time a narrative changer on climate [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=230.74s)]
*  change. No longer would it be the only narrative be we have 10 years left till we die. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=236.02s)]
*  We need climate action, net zero. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  We have to stop allowing gas powered cars. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  This would actually change that whole narrative and this would help Argentina help the Eastern [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=244.58s)]
*  European countries, all who are itching to join President Trump on what I call a clexit, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=250.78s)]
*  the climate exit from the UN summit, UN climate treaty, which is similar to the Brexit. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=256.5s)]
*  But this time we have to do it on the climate issue. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=261.54s)]
*  And hopefully it might also put an end to all the child slaves that are in Africa digging [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=263.86s)]
*  for cobalt for this agenda. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=272.6s)]
*  My goals are a little less lofty. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=274.54s)]
*  I just want a dishwasher that works. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=276.70000000000005s)]
*  I do want the slave labor in China to end, but I also want a dishwasher that actually [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=278.42s)]
*  works that I don't have to clean the dish before I put it in the dishwasher and then [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=283.5s)]
*  run it twice. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=288.38s)]
*  So let's hope for that too in the new year and in the new administration. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=289.38s)]
*  Mark Marano, so great to have you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXedN4IK1kg&t=292.94s)]
