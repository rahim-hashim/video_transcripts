# Harvard president takes shot at Trump in commencement speech
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw)
*  The other big story is Harvard University's graduation took place yesterday and it was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=0.0s)]
*  filled with jabs and digs at President Trump as court battles play out over the restrictions [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=4.16s)]
*  of foreign students enrollments as well as federal funding cuts to the tune of billions [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=9.28s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=14.32s)]
*  So Chanley Painter joins us live from the Harvard campus. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=15.32s)]
*  Your lawyer Chanley, can you take us through the latest in this legal battle? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=18.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=23.6s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=25.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=26.44s)]
*  The court's hearing in federal court, not far from where I am right now, on the campus [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=27.44s)]
*  of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=31.96s)]
*  And it was happening simultaneously with commencement ceremonies. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=34.64s)]
*  But inside the federal courthouse, the judge, she simply extended her temporary restraining [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=37.6s)]
*  order over the Trump administration's attempt to ban Harvard from enrolling foreign students. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=43.02s)]
*  It all happened about last week when DHS Secretary Kristi Noem restricted or revoked the school's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=49.88s)]
*  right to enroll students, Harvard suing, and then this restraining order or this block [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=56.44s)]
*  was put in place while this all plays out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=62.32s)]
*  So it's temporary, a temporary win for the university here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=65.16s)]
*  But again, this will be litigated over the months, possibly years. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=68.48s)]
*  We'll see what the court does, guys. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  So Chanley, know that about it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=73.64s)]
*  The President of the United States first sparred with Columbia and then Harvard with their [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=74.8s)]
*  anti-Semitic displays were in his crosshairs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=78.16s)]
*  So he's cracking down on them, holding back money for their grants because until they [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=80.84s)]
*  crack down on it, and then we see them doubling, tripling down along the way. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=85.8s)]
*  And then he starts looking into who's getting admitted to that school. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=89.96s)]
*  Yesterday, I imagine there was a time for pushback during the ceremony. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=93.88s)]
*  But reports are there were not so subtle jabs at the 47th president. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=98.12s)]
*  Brian, not so subtle jabs, of course, by the commencement speakers, even by some of the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=103.44s)]
*  people that I spoke to here on the sidewalk at campus in and out of the graduation ceremonies [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=109.4s)]
*  taking place because, of course, Harvard has been in the headlines for weeks and months [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=114.0s)]
*  with this battle between the White House with the freezing funds, as well as two competing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=118.68s)]
*  litigation lawsuits between the university and the federal government. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=123.8s)]
*  Well, inside Harvard Yard, where the commencement service was taking place, the president of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=127.8s)]
*  the university had some insinuations, to say the least, to say about what was happening [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=133.16s)]
*  in federal court at the same time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=138.56s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=140.0s)]
*  Members of the class of 2025 from down the street, across the country, and around the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=141.64s)]
*  world, around the world, just as it should be. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=150.64s)]
*  That standing ovation went on for about a minute, guys. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=156.0s)]
*  You can hear the loud applause. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=171.72s)]
*  And as I spoke to students and family outside after the service, many of them echoed his [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=174.16s)]
*  sentiments about, you know, pro-Harvard and against a band of foreign students saying [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=179.56s)]
*  diversity is what makes this university great in their classmates and what brings strength [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=184.36s)]
*  to the university. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=189.08s)]
*  It's interesting that Harvard actually reports nearly 7,000 of their students, of the 30,000 [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=190.08s)]
*  or so students here are foreign students. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  That's about 27% of the student population here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=198.8s)]
*  Again, the Trump administration wanting to vet these for national security reasons more [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=202.4s)]
*  closely. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=206.68s)]
*  Even Trump mentioning a couple of days ago, he would like it to be more like 15% of the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=207.96s)]
*  student population as opposed to 27, guys. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=212.28s)]
*  Okay, Chandley, I heard your report talking with Brian earlier. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=215.12s)]
*  You said you found one person on the campus that likes Brian, that watches Brian. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  Why does that? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=223.68s)]
*  Is that your take on the report? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=224.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=225.68s)]
*  Okay, but you talked to the students about the anti-Semitism, which is a serious issue [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=226.68s)]
*  on the campus, and you asked them, are they seeing this? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  What are their reactions? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  Can we show this and then we'll talk to you on the other side, Chandley? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=234.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=238.36s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=239.36s)]
*  I personally didn't experience it, but that doesn't mean that others didn't. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=240.4s)]
*  Proud of how Harvard has handled itself, and I am a proud graduate of the institution, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  but there are certain practices, there are certain measures being taken right now that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=255.36s)]
*  I think are counterproductive. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=259.44s)]
*  Can Harvard do more? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=261.44s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=263.16s)]
*  I think they could always do more to make all students feel more comfortable. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=264.16s)]
*  Alright, Chandley. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=268.24s)]
*  Yeah, guys, this was so interesting. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=271.24s)]
*  Yes, and Brian, I was walking around with my team, working hard with the Fox. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=274.24s)]
*  I wasn't afraid to have the Fox & Friends logo here at Harvard University. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=279.64s)]
*  We did have some comments, but it could have been a lot worse. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=284.88s)]
*  Everyone was really gracious. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=287.24s)]
*  Celebratory atmosphere here yesterday with graduation going on. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=288.52s)]
*  I do want to know what those students did say to me because while they were, of course, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=291.68s)]
*  proud of their degree, proud of their university where they just graduated from, many of them, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=297.08s)]
*  in fact, most of them acknowledged that there is work to be done as far as antisemitism [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=302.0s)]
*  goes here on campus and the policies and practices of the university, especially after last year's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  anti-Israel protests here on campus. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=312.72s)]
*  That was a common theme. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=315.2s)]
*  In fact, the first young man that I talked to in that, I asked him, I followed up about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=316.2s)]
*  the foreign student ban from the Trump administration as one of those remedial efforts to try to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  get the university to comply with some of these demands from the administration. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=326.56s)]
*  And he said to me, which was an interesting point possibly, that the vetting of national [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=331.6s)]
*  security interests of foreign students should be the government in the visa process, not [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=336.16s)]
*  the university's job. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=340.04s)]
*  So he took kind of that position on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  And most of them, while they said they acknowledged some change needs to happen, that they personally [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=344.0s)]
*  did see some of their friends suffer from some of that antisemitic actions over the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=349.38s)]
*  years, guys. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=353.86s)]
*  I'm sure that the ones that wanted to go to class, you know, and they get stopped. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=354.86s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  Appreciate it, Chandler. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  So I would just add one more thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  The Alan Garber himself on an NPR podcast, the president of the school said, we have [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=362.54s)]
*  to do a better job being tolerant not only of Jews, but of other people's beliefs. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  And there was a sense among faculty and students that they cannot speak out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=373.94s)]
*  They're self-conscious and while admitting that only about 5% of their campus is conservative. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=377.98s)]
*  Did you see the commencement and all the crowd? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=382.74s)]
*  I was like, who do you people think you are? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=386.06s)]
*  You think you get to be a liberal conclave, have people, 30% of your, you know, emission [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=388.38s)]
*  there from other countries and then be a hotbed for Hamas as well, block the Jews, and then [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=395.1s)]
*  you want our money as well? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=401.98s)]
*  You can continue to do this, but we don't have to fund it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=403.5s)]
*  You know, that's what the fight in the courts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  I think it is, I understand his point. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=407.94s)]
*  I went to a college where we have a big international community. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  We have our business school when I was there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=412.62s)]
*  It was the number one international business school in the world. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=414.58s)]
*  So I get that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  I get, and it's always interesting to talk to people from other parts of the world, to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=418.82s)]
*  go and visit other parts of the world. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=422.78s)]
*  I get that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=424.38s)]
*  Donald Trump was just saying, maybe not so many, allow some of those spots to go to more [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=425.38s)]
*  Americans that are just equally as qualified. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=428.97999999999996s)]
*  But he also said, for those that are on your campus, we want to know anyone who's been [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  in trouble. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=436.06s)]
*  If they're foreign students and they've been in trouble, we want to look at their records. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=437.66s)]
*  We need to see their code of conduct because I want to make sure they're not affiliated [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=441.18s)]
*  with Hamas or a terrorist organization. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=444.74s)]
*  So it's pretty common. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=446.46s)]
*  This is common sense. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=447.82s)]

*  What do you need to make our campus safe? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=452.9s)]
*  And then if you'll continue to fund us, I'll do what you would like. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=455.18s)]

*  Chinese have no social media footprint. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=460.74s)]
*  They don't allow Facebook. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=462.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=463.66s)]
*  They don't allow Twitter. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=464.66s)]
*  So they'll have nothing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=465.66s)]

*  Right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=472.86s)]
*  But 18% of the foreign students are Chinese at Harvard. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=473.86s)]
*  Out of the 27%. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-FDE_Xozw&t=476.78000000000003s)]
