# Trump: These lunatics cannot take over
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM)
*  A doctor, please take your time, please. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, former President Donald Trump, stopping in the middle of his own rally yesterday to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=7.2s)]
*  go and help that young lady, someone in need of medical help, at his first outdoor rally [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=31.32s)]
*  since surviving the assassination attempt last month when he was shot. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=36.32s)]
*  Joining us now is the 45th President of the United States who wants to be the 47th, and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=40.36s)]
*  he is the GOP presidential nominee, President Donald Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=43.84s)]
*  President Trump, welcome back. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=48.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=49.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=50.52s)]
*  So, Mr. President, first off, the first time you're doing an outdoor event, you didn't [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=51.52s)]
*  hesitate when you heard this woman collapsed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=56.74s)]
*  You walked over to see for yourself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Did you have any hesitation walking down those steps without the protective glass around [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  you? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=66.04s)]
*  No, I didn't really. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=67.04s)]
*  I wanted to help the woman. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=68.04s)]
*  She had problems. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=69.04s)]
*  She really had a problem. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=70.04s)]
*  You know, it was very hot, close to 100 degrees. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=71.04s)]
*  I'm going to be in a pretty hot place today, too, from what I just saw in your weather [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=74.0s)]
*  forecast. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=77.48s)]
*  But she was in trouble. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=78.48s)]
*  No, I didn't really. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  I didn't think too much about it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to think about it, actually. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  I felt we had very good protection. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=85.92s)]
*  Mr. President, when you listen to the DNC and all the speeches, they're spreading so [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=89.12s)]
*  many different lies and we eat, breathe and sleep this, as you do, too, more than we do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=95.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=99.6s)]
*  And you know that what they're saying is wrong, but you don't hear your take. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=100.6s)]
*  There's no one fact checking. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  And here is Governor Tim Walz trying to still connect you to Project 2025. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=106.44s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=111.16s)]
*  Some folks just don't understand what it takes to be a good neighbor. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=112.16s)]
*  Take Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  Their Project 2025 will make things much, much harder for people who are just trying [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=123.16s)]
*  to live their lives. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=128.76s)]
*  They spend a lot of time pretending they know nothing about this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=130.88s)]
*  But look, I coached high school football long enough to know, and trust me on this, when [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=134.88s)]
*  somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they're going to use it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=140.42s)]
*  And we know if these guys get back in the White House, they'll start jacking up the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=149.72s)]
*  costs on the middle class, they'll repeal the Affordable Care Act, they'll gut Social [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=154.92s)]
*  Security and Medicare, and they will ban abortion across this country, with or without Congress. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=161.72s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=169.12s)]
*  It's an agenda nobody asked for. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=170.6s)]
*  It's an agenda that serves nobody except the richest and the most extreme amongst us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=174.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=181.72s)]
*  So this is your chance to set the record straight. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=182.72s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=184.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, he's a total lightweight, and he shouldn't be even having any access [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=185.24s)]
*  to possibly being president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=189.76s)]
*  The guy, he's been a terrible governor. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=191.4s)]
*  They've had nothing but problems in their state. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=194.4s)]
*  He has no capability. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=197.2s)]
*  They call him coach. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=198.76s)]
*  He's a semi-coach. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=199.76s)]
*  He coached some football for a little while. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=200.76s)]
*  This guy is a lightweight, and he shouldn't have access. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=203.72s)]
*  And for him to say about Project 25 is disgraceful. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=207.68s)]
*  They know I have nothing to do with it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=211.0s)]
*  I had no idea what it was. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  A group of people got together. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=214.96s)]
*  They drew up some conservative values, very conservative values. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=216.44s)]
*  And in some case, perhaps they went over the line. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=219.96s)]
*  Perhaps they didn't. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=223.44s)]
*  I have no idea what Project 25 is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=224.44s)]
*  But they use it, and they know it, just like Charlottesville, totally discredited. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=226.7s)]
*  They use Charlottesville. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, Biden gets up all the time, says Charlottesville. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=233.12s)]
*  He ran because of Charlottesville. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=235.4s)]
*  He got run out of office by the Democrats. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=237.4s)]
*  They did a coup on him, and he's sitting someplace in California on a beach. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=239.68s)]
*  Because he's in California, it's crime-ridden. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=244.8s)]
*  Crime-ridden place. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  It's not the same place. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  More people leaving than coming. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  And all of the things that these people have done. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=251.24s)]
*  Kamala has been the worst. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=253.36s)]
*  Everything she touched turned bad. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  California turned bad. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  San Francisco, you can't walk into San Francisco. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  You barely can go into California anymore. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=262.72s)]
*  People — it's a state that's in terrible, terrible crime trouble and every other form [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=264.8s)]
*  of trouble. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=269.96s)]
*  Monetary trouble. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=270.96s)]
*  It's got nothing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=271.96s)]
*  Drugs all over the place. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=273.2s)]
*  You go into Los Angeles. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=274.76s)]
*  You can't walk down the streets. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a shame between Gavin Newsom. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=277.32s)]
*  But it was really more Kamala, because she was your district attorney in San Francisco. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=280.48s)]
*  San Francisco is unlivable now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=286.32s)]
*  Unlivable. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=289.24s)]
*  Fifteen years ago, it was the most beautiful city. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=290.24s)]
*  One of the greatest cities in the world. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=292.36s)]
*  Today, it's unlivable. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=293.96s)]
*  It's going to have to be — hopefully be able to be brought back, if that's possible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=295.8s)]
*  Kamala, who's a Marxist and a radical left — frankly, she's a radical left lunatic. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=300.04s)]
*  And if she became our president, this country would turn out to be a big version of San [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=307.64s)]
*  Francisco or a big version of California itself. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=312.74s)]
*  So these guys, they talk about that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=316.34s)]
*  They talk about all different things that they know are totally discredited. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=318.2s)]
*  They have a thing with soldiers, where I'm looking over the graves of soldiers and saying [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=322.36s)]
*  a horrible thing about dead soldiers from World War I. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=327.28s)]
*  It was totally made up. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  It was a made-up story, confirmed — that was confirmed by — my side of it, by 26 [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=332.48s)]
*  people in the military that had never happened. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=339.96s)]
*  They had one lunatic talking about it, and they use it all the time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=342.91999999999996s)]
*  There's nobody that loves the military more than me. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=347.8s)]
*  Nobody did more for the military. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=350.08s)]
*  I rebuilt the military. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=351.68s)]
*  They gave $85 billion of it away to Afghanistan in the dumbest and one of the most horrible [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=353.08s)]
*  things that's ever happened, probably the most embarrassing moment that ever happened [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=360.32s)]
*  to a country in the way they pulled out. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=365.32s)]
*  And she was the last one in the room. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=366.32s)]
*  And she was the last one in the room when that decision was made. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=367.32s)]
*  She was the last one. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=369.32s)]
*  No, she was — [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=370.32s)]
*  Well, she made the decision. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=371.32s)]
*  She made the decision. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=372.32s)]
*  And it was one of the most embarrassing decisions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=373.32s)]
*  Not, Brian, not the fact that we got out. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=377.0s)]
*  The way they got out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  I was ready to get out, but I was going to keep Bagram. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  That's one of the biggest air bases in the world. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=382.32s)]
*  It was one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=384.76s)]
*  One hour away. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=388.82s)]
*  Very important that we keep it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=389.82s)]
*  They left Bagram. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=391.24s)]
*  The biggest runway, most powerful runways can handle the heaviest loads. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  This was designed billions and billions of dollars years ago. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=397.78s)]
*  We gave them the keys. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=401.4s)]
*  And now China occupies Bagram. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=402.56s)]
*  We should have kept that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  That was the one thing we should have stayed. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=406.24s)]
*  Not because of Afghanistan, but because of China. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=408.20000000000005s)]
*  And we gave it up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=411.64000000000004s)]
*  They took the soldiers out before they did soldiers first. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  We left people — we have — to this day, we have people living there that can't get [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=417.58000000000004s)]
*  out. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  We — 13 great people who I know the families, as you know. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  13 great people killed. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  45 absolutely obliterated the arms, the legs, and hundreds of people killed during that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=429.84s)]
*  day. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  People falling off planes — many people falling off planes from 3,000 feet up — that's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  like three times the height of the Empire State Building. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=442.56s)]
*  President Trump, you're talking about — [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=445.64s)]
*  It's so sad to see. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  You're talking about so many — [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  And then I have to listen to — excuse me, President — then I have to listen to a lightweight [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  like this get up and absolutely lie. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=452.35999999999996s)]
*  But they all lied. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=454.96s)]
*  And they mentioned my name. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=456.35999999999996s)]
*  I read where — and, frankly, I watched where you said — your group said you said, specifically. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  I think they mentioned me 297 times. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=463.6s)]
*  They mentioned the border once. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=466.68s)]
*  They mentioned crime twice. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=468.36s)]
*  They don't mention the economy because the economy is horrible. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=470.48s)]
*  They defrauded the people of our country with the job numbers. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=473.74s)]
*  You saw that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=477.94s)]
*  818,000 fake jobs they put on the rolls. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=479.94s)]
*  They thought they could keep it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=483.76s)]
*  They thought they were going to keep those numbers until right after the election, when [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=485.72s)]
*  they could announce a revision. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=489.32000000000005s)]
*  But they weren't able to do that because they had a leaker, and somebody leaked the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=491.48s)]
*  numbers. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=495.16s)]
*  They were fraudulent job numbers, just like they have fraudulent crime numbers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=496.16s)]
*  The FBI didn't include New York, Chicago, and Oakland, and a couple of other places [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=500.14000000000004s)]
*  that aren't doing so well in crime. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=506.20000000000005s)]
*  If they would have included those numbers, they're the worst crime numbers we've ever [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=508.5s)]
*  had. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=512.44s)]
*  So Mr. President, let's talk about Chicago. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=514.32s)]
*  You brought it up. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=517.1600000000001s)]
*  I had the opportunity. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  I've been going all over Chicago for years now, but I went to a barbershop, and there [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=519.1600000000001s)]
*  was a lot of people there. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=523.32s)]
*  They talked about you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=524.96s)]
*  They talked about Kamala Harris stealing the tip plan from you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=526.0400000000001s)]
*  They say they're open. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=529.3000000000001s)]
*  This is a little bit from the folks that I talked to watch. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=530.72s)]
*  We've been doing these barbershop tours since 2003, and it's really enlightening to hear [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  individuals start to change their political direction. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=541.82s)]
*  I think it's time that blacks in general need to boost our political IQ. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=545.3000000000001s)]
*  Stop being blindly faithful to a one-party system that doesn't work for us. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  So I've always liked Donald Trump. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=556.82s)]
*  He was an icon for years in our community. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=560.46s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, now he's this big clansman. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=562.9000000000001s)]
*  What changed? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=565.7s)]
*  I think the powers that be saw his potential in our community. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=567.06s)]
*  If somebody, if Republicans started to come and really communicate in these communities, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=572.74s)]
*  they'll come to barbershops and they'll start to see. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=578.66s)]
*  We talk in the same language, but they don't have, they don't know how to communicate. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=581.02s)]
*  So they'd rather not do it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=585.78s)]
*  So Mr. President, he says that you've got to directly communicate to the voters. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=587.86s)]
*  Will you be on the ground at barbershops, local communities, talking about the issues [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=591.9s)]
*  that matter to them? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=597.06s)]
*  And I am going to be doing that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=599.38s)]
*  I like that guy and I like those people. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=600.6999999999999s)]
*  And I watched yesterday as you did it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=602.98s)]
*  You are doing fantastically, by the way. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=604.66s)]
*  I watched yesterday as you did the interviews. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=606.74s)]
*  Those are great people. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=610.74s)]
*  Those are people just want safety. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=611.74s)]
*  They don't want much. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=613.62s)]
*  He wants to run his barbershop. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=614.62s)]
*  The people that were getting the haircut, I was thinking about maybe going there myself [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=616.62s)]
*  because that's, I like the work. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=620.74s)]
*  Maybe they didn't make my hair look better. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=623.1800000000001s)]
*  I'd pay a lot of money for that haircut. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=625.38s)]
*  They can make my hair look better. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=627.38s)]
*  But you know, honestly, those are great people. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=629.1s)]
*  Those are hardworking people. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=631.62s)]
*  They're strong. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=633.3s)]
*  They're tough. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=634.3s)]
*  And they know they're being conned by the Democrats. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=635.3s)]
*  You have a corrupt political system in Chicago. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=638.26s)]
*  Look at your governor. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=641.46s)]
*  The governor is an incompetent guy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=642.46s)]
*  He was thrown out of the family business. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=643.86s)]
*  He was hired hotel. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=645.7s)]
*  I was partners with them years ago on a job in New York. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=647.42s)]
*  They threw him out of the business. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=651.02s)]
*  I know the family very well. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=652.2199999999999s)]
*  They threw him out because they didn't want him in the business. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  He ends up being governor. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=656.26s)]
*  He has money. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=657.26s)]
*  He ends up being governor. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=658.26s)]
*  He's incompetent. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=659.66s)]
*  Look, the Chicago and the whole Illinois thing is very, very corrupt. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=660.66s)]
*  But we're putting a big play there. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=666.4599999999999s)]
*  We're putting a big play in New York. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=667.8599999999999s)]
*  You have the same situation in New York. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=669.0999999999999s)]
*  If you went to a barbershop, any barbershop that you're talking about, if you went to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=671.14s)]
*  a barbershop in New York, in Los Angeles, in any place you want to talk about, you're [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=674.78s)]
*  going to find the same thing, the same reaction. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=680.8199999999999s)]
*  They're really upset. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=683.4599999999999s)]
*  And I watched the mothers on your show this morning before we went on. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=685.3399999999999s)]
*  So sad. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=689.5799999999999s)]
*  They've given up on life. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=690.86s)]
*  You have the worst prosecutors. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=691.86s)]
*  They go after guys like me. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=694.1s)]
*  They don't go. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=696.1s)]
*  They go after me because I question the elections and things like that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=697.1s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=700.5799999999999s)]
*  If you can't question an election, we don't have a country. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=702.4200000000001s)]
*  But when people get killed, when their children get killed, nothing happens. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=707.26s)]
*  I remember Jesse Smollett. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=712.22s)]
*  I said, you got to prosecute this guy. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=713.9000000000001s)]
*  And they did. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=715.9000000000001s)]
*  But Jesse Smollett was given a free hand. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=716.9000000000001s)]
*  And yet these killers, and they know who they are. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=720.38s)]
*  The worst thing is they know who they are. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  They don't even go and pick them up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=725.74s)]
*  And you have many communities like that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=727.7s)]
*  Chicago is terrible in that respect. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=729.42s)]
*  But you have many communities like that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=731.66s)]
*  Chicago 20 years ago was a great city. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=733.9s)]
*  I built a great building in Chicago. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=736.54s)]
*  In fact, I see it every time they do the skyline. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=738.18s)]
*  But Chicago has gone really wrong. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=741.74s)]
*  And I think I'm going to get a tremendous amount of votes from Chicago. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=745.26s)]
*  What would you do differently, Mr. President? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=748.26s)]
*  What would you do differently, though? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=749.26s)]
*  You see what the Biden administration is. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=750.4599999999999s)]
*  Are you sending in the National Guard? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=751.9399999999999s)]
*  Are you mobilizing the business? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=753.98s)]
*  Are you going to change the education system? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=755.4599999999999s)]
*  Day one, if there's a Donald Trump presidency, what would you do in Chicago? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=757.62s)]
*  First of all, I know the people in Chicago. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=762.58s)]
*  I know the police because I built the building there. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=764.62s)]
*  I spent a lot of time building it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=766.98s)]
*  It's a great building, a really great building. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=769.4200000000001s)]
*  And what happened is I got to know a lot of people, including the police. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=771.7s)]
*  You have a great police force in Chicago, just like you do in New York, just like you [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=775.86s)]
*  do in Los Angeles. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=780.7s)]
*  You have great — they're not allowed to do their jobs. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=781.7s)]
*  You've got to let the police do their jobs, number one. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=784.38s)]
*  Number two, you have to do a policy of stop and frisk. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=786.78s)]
*  When you see a guy coming down the street and you can — the police know every one [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=790.26s)]
*  of them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=794.26s)]
*  They know their middle name. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=795.26s)]
*  They know where they live. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=796.26s)]
*  They know every one of them, the local police. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=797.26s)]
*  And they're great. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=799.26s)]
*  You got to let them do their job. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=800.26s)]
*  Stop and frisk and take their gun away. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=802.5s)]
*  You've got to do it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=805.02s)]
*  If somebody has — because they have all these guns. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=806.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, it's very interesting. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=809.34s)]
*  The toughest gun law — the toughest by far — in the whole United States is in Chicago. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=811.14s)]
*  And yet, it's the most — it's — [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=817.54s)]
*  The most violent. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=819.5s)]
*  On the Fourth of July weekend, 117 people were shot and 17 died. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=820.5s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=827.8199999999999s)]
*  That's worse than Afghanistan. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan doesn't have that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=829.8199999999999s)]
*  No place has that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=832.58s)]
*  That's a war zone. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=833.58s)]
*  This last weekend, during the — just prior to the start of the convention, with all the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=835.02s)]
*  police, everything else — do you know that so far, five people have been killed? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=840.66s)]
*  You don't read about it because the press doesn't want to report about it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=846.5s)]
*  Five people have been killed in Chicago during the Democrat convention. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=850.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=853.42s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=854.42s)]
*  Mr. President, let's talk about the Democratic National Convention. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=855.42s)]
*  We'll stay in Chicago. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=857.38s)]
*  Let's go to the stage. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=858.38s)]
*  Tonight, Kamala Harris will take the stage. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=859.38s)]
*  Many people have pointed out, if we're talking about policies — many of which you're talking [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  about this morning — you win. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=866.08s)]
*  If we're talking about personalities, it's playing into Democrats. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=868.2s)]
*  As you pointed out, they're trying to talk about your personality. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=871.96s)]
*  Brian, interestingly brought up, they're no longer saying you're a threat to democracy. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=874.44s)]
*  They're saying things like you're a fraudster. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=878.2800000000001s)]
*  They are, as you pointed out, putting lies out there like the suckers and losers hoax [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  or the bloodbath hoax or the very fine people hoax. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=885.8000000000001s)]
*  Tim Waltz said last night that you were going to introduce a national abortion ban. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=889.32s)]
*  The question is, how do you, as Kamala Harris takes the stage, turn this into something [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=893.32s)]
*  about how you or she will affect the lives of Americans and less about you or Kamala [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  Harris as personalities? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=904.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, in terms of personality, I don't think she has a personality because [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=906.36s)]
*  she's allowed crime to flourish wherever she wants. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=911.6s)]
*  And if I were a person, I wouldn't like that personality. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=914.6400000000001s)]
*  That's not the personality. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=917.2800000000001s)]
*  I want whatever she's got. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=918.2800000000001s)]
*  They don't have it because San Francisco was crime ridden and it's gotten worse and worse. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=920.56s)]
*  I mean, she had policies at $950. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  You can steal anything you want up to $950 in a store and they're not going to prosecute [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  the people. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=934.64s)]
*  They have policies that are absolutely insane. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=935.64s)]
*  This guy Waltz comes out and he wants tampons sold in young men's bathrooms. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=939.0s)]
*  You have to have tampons available, not even sold, available in young men's bathrooms. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=944.68s)]
*  They're giving our government away when we put two lunatics like this in. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=950.04s)]
*  They can't, if they take over our government as president and vice president, our country [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=954.88s)]
*  doesn't stand a chance. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=961.12s)]
*  The whole world, I know every leader, the whole world is laughing at us. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=962.8399999999999s)]
*  They can't even believe it's happening. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=966.7199999999999s)]
*  Biden was incompetent. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=968.52s)]
*  He was the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=970.0799999999999s)]
*  I see the way they're trying to build him up. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=972.4s)]
*  It was an overthrow. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=974.56s)]
*  She is worse than him because she's actually a radical left Marxist. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=976.12s)]
*  That's what she is. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=981.44s)]
*  That's what she's always going to be. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  She's going to ban fracking. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=984.16s)]
*  She's going to ban all energy production coming out of the ground. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=986.08s)]
*  She is going to ban everything that's good. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=989.78s)]
*  And she's going to go to like the all electric car mandate. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=992.48s)]
*  How ridiculous is that? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=996.36s)]
*  They're too expensive. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=998.32s)]
*  They don't go far. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=999.44s)]
*  And they do have a market, but we want gasoline propelled cars. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1000.44s)]
*  We want hybrids. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1004.4s)]
*  We want lots of things. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1005.5s)]
*  We can have everything. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1007.42s)]
*  What they're doing to our country is unbelievable. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1008.94s)]
*  And most importantly, they've made our country very safe. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1012.5s)]
*  And internationally, they've made it even more safe. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1015.54s)]
*  As bad as when you see Chicago in the cities, as bad as they are, much worse internationally. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1018.42s)]
*  We're going to end up in World War Three because she's incompetent. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1023.9s)]
*  Biden sent her. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1027.66s)]
*  Russia would have never happened with Ukraine if I were president. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1029.38s)]
*  The attack on Israel would have never happened. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1033.5s)]
*  Iran had no money. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1035.7s)]
*  They had no money to give to Hamas or Hezbollah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1036.82s)]
*  But let me tell you, and a little known fact that the press doesn't want to talk about, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1039.66s)]
*  Biden sent, I call her comrade Kamala, sent comrade Kamala to see Putin in Russia three [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1045.66s)]
*  days before the attack. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1054.48s)]
*  She went, she said, she gave her case. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1056.98s)]
*  He attacked three days later. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1059.94s)]
*  He attacked three days later. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1061.74s)]
*  He laughed at her. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1063.18s)]
*  He thought she was a joke. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1064.26s)]
*  Now he's really laughing when he sees her. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1066.06s)]
*  Can you imagine her negotiating with President Xi of China, with Kim Jong-un of North Korea? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1068.14s)]
*  The whole thing is like we're living in a fantasy land. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1074.6200000000001s)]
*  And then I see the people, it's like they're having a party. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1078.76s)]
*  They don't mention the border. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1081.26s)]
*  All they do is make up lies about me. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1083.14s)]
*  Every one of those things, and I'm really appreciative that you brought that up, Brian. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1085.3400000000001s)]
*  Every one of those things is a lie, what they say about me. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1089.46s)]
*  Project 25, I have no idea what the hell, and I don't even want to see it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1094.02s)]
*  I don't want to read it because I want to say I have no idea what it is. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1098.42s)]
*  Some people get together, they do something that's extreme. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1102.6200000000001s)]
*  I assume it's extreme. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1105.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't know because I don't even want to see it. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1106.9s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1109.1000000000001s)]
*  On abortion, I will bring it up. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1110.66s)]
*  We did a great thing. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1112.94s)]
*  We got rid of it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1113.94s)]
*  We did something that for 52 years people have wanted to do. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1114.94s)]
*  They wanted to get rid of Roe v. Wade. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1119.22s)]
*  They wanted to bring that subject back to the states. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1121.42s)]
*  Every Democrat wanted that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1125.66s)]
*  Every Republican, every liberal, every conservative, and every legal scholar. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1127.2s)]
*  And I did it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1131.7s)]
*  And it's now back in the state where it belongs. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1132.7s)]
*  And they're taking votes. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1134.8600000000001s)]
*  The states, Ohio came out with a much more liberal policy than people would have thought. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1136.18s)]
*  Kansas, the same thing. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1141.22s)]
*  Texas maybe will be different. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1142.9s)]
*  And what it was is they want the vote of the people. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1144.94s)]
*  Now, I will say, like Ronald Reagan, I'm for exceptions for rape incest and the life of [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1148.66s)]
*  the mother. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1155.18s)]
*  I'm for exceptions. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1156.18s)]
*  Ronald Reagan was for exceptions. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1157.18s)]
*  Most people are for exceptions. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1159.18s)]
*  You have to follow your heart. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1161.3s)]
*  But it's being voted on. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1162.98s)]
*  And an issue that's ripped our country apart for 50 years is being solved at the voting [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1164.9s)]
*  booth. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1171.82s)]
*  And states are voting in what they want. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1172.82s)]
*  And a lot of these policies, I will tell you, are much more liberal than people would have [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1175.58s)]
*  thought happened. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1179.86s)]
*  But they say in the — I want a federal ban. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co4jxfmuSUM&t=1180.86s)]
