# The media is downplaying this: Former LA sheriff
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY)
*  and he has to do that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's why we're here today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  All right, Bunker Fox News [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=6.84s)]
*  alert the Trump administration [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=7.7s)]
*  sitting in additional forces to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=9.5s)]
*  restore order to Los Angeles as [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=10.98s)]
*  anti ice riots enter into the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=13.38s)]
*  fifth day. So let's get right [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=14.98s)]
*  to Jonathan honeys live on the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  ground and L. A. Hey, Jonathan. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=16.34s)]
*  Ainsley Lawrence. Brian Good [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=20.68s)]
*  morning to all of you. I have [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=22.64s)]
*  to say that 24 hours ago, we [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=25.02s)]
*  joined you from this precise [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=26.12s)]
*  location outside the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=27.72s)]
*  relaxed security posture here today. You can see a handful of National Guard [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=29.6s)]
*  outside the detention center behind me but yesterday at this time the entire [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  street was blocked off. A phalanx of National Guard troops were right across [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=39.92s)]
*  this street. It is certainly a different atmosphere in LA this morning and that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=45.64s)]
*  might be a sign that authorities believe they are getting a grip on these [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=50.94s)]
*  protests. Of course that is not to say there was not violence yesterday. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=55.44s)]
*  Thousands of protesters were once again on the streets of downtown LA but the LAPD [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  operation along with the Sheriff's Department and the California Highway [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=66.0s)]
*  Patrol seemed a lot more efficient yesterday. They broke the protesters [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=69.84s)]
*  into various groups. They continually pushed them back using tear gas rounds, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  using flash bangs, using in some cases rubber bullets. In the meantime as you [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=80.44s)]
*  mentioned President Trump has ordered Marines now to come to LA. We understand [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=86.44s)]
*  that 700 Marines left their base at 29 Palms that is out towards the Palm [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=92.88s)]
*  Springs area east of LA yesterday. We believe that they staged overnight at [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=98.2s)]
*  Naval Station Seal Beach and that they should be deployed on the streets of LA [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=103.8s)]
*  at some point later today. California Governor Gavin Newsom said of that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=109.6s)]
*  deployment quote the Secretary of Defense is illegally deploying them onto [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=114.64s)]
*  American streets so Trump can have a talking point at his parade this weekend. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=119.56s)]
*  It's a blatant abuse of power. We will sue to stop this. Nonetheless President [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=125.12s)]
*  Trump and others will say that their deployment of the National Guard on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=131.4s)]
*  Sunday clearly made a difference that those Sunday clashes were much more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=135.44s)]
*  violent than they were on Monday and they will argue that that is because in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=140.08s)]
*  part they are surging forces here. In the meantime the search to round up some of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=144.4s)]
*  those involved in the violence goes on. Elpidio Reina was a 40 year old man who [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=150.52s)]
*  was seen throwing rocks and bricks at law enforcement officers. Pam Bondi the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=155.64s)]
*  attorney general announced on Hannity last night that they have formally [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=162.0s)]
*  identified him. Here's the attorney general. That guy has just been [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=167.28s)]
*  identified and they are doing a search warrant on his house as we speak. So you [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=172.0s)]
*  can run you can't hide we are coming after you federally. If you assault a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=178.8s)]
*  police officer, if you rob a store, if you loot, if you spit on a police officer [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=184.56s)]
*  we're coming after you. Now as we understand it Reina is still a fugitive [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=189.64s)]
*  at this point. He is a wanted man. $50,000 being offered as a reward for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=196.76s)]
*  information that leads to his arrest. But clearly a couple of messages from the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  administration. One as Pam Bondi was just saying the attorney general they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=207.6s)]
*  will find anybody involved in violent incidents over the last four days here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=211.64s)]
*  in LA and two the bigger message is that whatever force that the Trump [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=216.8s)]
*  administration deems necessary to restore order here in LA will be used. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=222.4s)]
*  Lawrence Bryan Ainsley. So Jonathan quick question for you. The local cops I'm not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  seeing many arrests and I'm seeing illegal activity happening. Now I've seen [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  some of the feds rushing in and grabbing people and taking them into custody. Do [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  you know from your sources why they aren't arresting some of these [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  individuals? You haven't seen arrests in the hundreds Lawrence but the LAPD has [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=246.0s)]
*  been arresting people. They've been out with zip ties throughout the day, Sunday [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=254.56s)]
*  and again yesterday. So arrests are being made by everybody involved in this and I [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=259.0s)]
*  have to say that there were certainly questions, legitimate questions about the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=266.12s)]
*  response of the LAPD on Friday night. They did seem to me as I watched it all [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=270.0s)]
*  unfold to be very slow in moving but since then they have been heavily [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=274.24s)]
*  involved in policing the streets and it appeared to me that all of the agencies [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=279.2s)]
*  the LAPD, the LASD, California Highway Patrol, the National Guard and federal [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=284.08s)]
*  officers from Homeland Security all working very well together yesterday. The [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=291.32s)]
*  operation I have to say as it unfolded last night of splintering these groups [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=296.72s)]
*  forcing them backwards, making the arrests when necessary seemed to be a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=301.48s)]
*  very efficient one yesterday and certainly arrests were being made Lawrence. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=305.44s)]
*  Jonathan what about the opposition? We hear it's three predominantly groups the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=310.0s)]
*  Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights supported by the state, the government [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=313.32s)]
*  and the Chinese government. The Party for Socialism and Liberation and the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=316.8s)]
*  Service Employees International Union. Have you seen them handing out face [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  shields? Have you seen them sanding out rocks and things like that? The role some [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  of them are wearing all black? Some organization there? There's certainly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=329.52s)]
*  some organization and let's be frank in any major protest there is always a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=336.0s)]
*  level of organization. There are always groups that get involved in that and yes [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=341.08s)]
*  masks are being handed out, water is being handed out so there is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=345.32s)]
*  organization on that level as you would expect and these are groups that we have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=349.44s)]
*  seen before getting involved in other protests here. You'll recall the LAPD [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=355.68s)]
*  chief Jim McDonnell saying on Sunday that while there are people involved in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=360.56s)]
*  these protests who have the cause of immigration in their heart and soul they [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=366.88s)]
*  are not the ones in his view causing the violence. What Jim McDonnell said is that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=372.32s)]
*  they are agitators, they are anarchists as he put it and he said you could use a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=377.52s)]
*  lot of other words for them who come in, they've seen them in the in the George [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=382.0s)]
*  Floyd protests, they've seen them in the anti Wall Street protests, the same [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=385.84s)]
*  people keep coming back because in the view of Jim McDonnell they just want to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=389.16s)]
*  cause trouble. That's it. And they're getting paid. Thanks so much Jonathan. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=394.52s)]
*  Thank you Jonathan. Well you have Cory Booker and Maxine Waters and Keem [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=398.24s)]
*  Jeffries they're all saying these are peaceful protests. If you watched our [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=401.4s)]
*  network last night you saw they were not. They had these rioters were throwing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=404.92s)]
*  frozen water bottles at police, they were waving Mexican flags, burning [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=409.56s)]
*  American flags, they were handing out earplugs and gas masks, throwing Molotov [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=413.32s)]
*  cocktails, they hid baseball bats in the bushes, they lobbed fireworks and sticks [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=418.0s)]
*  at police and I did see people being arrested. Lawrence on my drive into work [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=422.64s)]
*  I was on social media just reading some of the articles. Lots people were being [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=426.48s)]
*  arrested. There was one lady that that punched a cop and they put her on the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=430.52s)]
*  ground they arrested her and I read that since Friday there have been 60 plus [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=434.76s)]
*  people arrested. The problem is is when when they say the peaceful protesters [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=439.04s)]
*  it's all organized in the sense of you got the people that throw stuff at the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=443.8s)]
*  cops and then the people that aren't throwing things they use themselves as a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  shield and they hide themselves behind those people so you got to break it all [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=451.12s)]
*  up. I just worry about the whole situation anyway we got to move on. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=456.72s)]
*  Alright it's nine minutes after the top of the hours. Rioters attack law [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  enforcement and destroy property. California's governor Gavin Newsom [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  getting into a heated back-and-forth with President Trump. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=466.88s)]
*  Maddie Rivera joins us with the details from the White House. Good morning. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=469.68s)]
*  Good morning Lawrence, Ainsley and Brian. California governor Gavin Newsom is [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=473.96s)]
*  already promising more legal action against the Trump administration this [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=478.0s)]
*  time over the deployment of those 700 Marines. Remember he's already suing the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=481.6s)]
*  Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard. The president [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=486.32s)]
*  meantime has called Newsom incompetent and is responding to the governor's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  allegation that he wants a civil war. What do you make of the fact that he says [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=493.2s)]
*  you want a civil war on the streets of America? No that's just the opposite I [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  don't want a civil war. Civil war would happen if you left it if you left it to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  people like him. So the president says he does not want a civil war but the war of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=509.2s)]
*  words between him and Newsom shows no signs of stopping at this point. Here he [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=515.48s)]
*  is backing Newsom's arrest after the governor dared border czar Tom Homan to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=520.44s)]
*  do so. Then the reporter asked me well could you ever govern Newsom or Mayor [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  Bass be arrested? I said well no one's above and law if they cross the line to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=530.2800000000001s)]
*  commit a crime absolutely they can. Gavin Newsom hey he's daring Tom Homan to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=533.84s)]
*  come and arrest him. Should he do it? I would do it if I were Tom I think it's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=540.9200000000001s)]

*  because he's done such a bad job. Well he's probably he's trying to use this as [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=645.76s)]
*  a spearhead to run for president now. Now remember just a month ago he decided he [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=649.48s)]
*  wanted to be a moderate and he was doing all these podcasts with conservative [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=654.64s)]

*  allow the people to continue the wrong so yes arrest the violent people but it's [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=676.8s)]
*  unlawful right now. Tom Homan's point with Mayor Bass and with Governor [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=680.8s)]

*  of the National Guard via the president was actually welcome because now that [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=787.72s)]
*  frees up local law enforcement not to have to surround in guard for example the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=791.32s)]
*  Metropolitan Detention Center but as you can see it's too little too late and they [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkJJflff4eY&t=796.24s)]
