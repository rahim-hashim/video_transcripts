# 'Squad' Democrat Rashida Tlaib defends antisemitic, pro-Palestine ad
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk)
*  But there was one other chant, and this particular chant was heard on the streets of Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=0.0s)]
*  and New York and from a member of Congress. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=4.88s)]
*  The chant is, from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=7.42s)]
*  And it's anti-Semitic because it implies from the river to the sea, it's from the Jordan [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=10.84s)]
*  River to the Mediterranean Sea, they would wipe Israel off the face of the earth. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=15.26s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=20.84s)]
*  Congresswoman Tlaib from the great state of Michigan used that and got some blowback. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=21.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=27.48s)]
*  Mr. President, the American people are not with you on this one. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=29.36s)]
*  And don't walk and break the sea. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=32.24s)]
*  And don't walk and break the sea. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=34.88s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=39.76s)]
*  We will remember in 2024. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=43.04s)]
*  Well produced, well financed, good job. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  You're watching a civil war on the left. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=56.08s)]
*  Because Lawrence, Bernie Sanders was asked to condemn this for these remarks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=58.4s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  We have Tlaib saying what she's saying, and Omar did not condemn this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=64.32s)]
*  And Jayapal did not condemn these remarks against their own president. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  That's what happens when you weaponize this woke victim ideology. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=73.48s)]
*  It blows up in your face, doesn't it? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=78.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the problem is, Brian, it's just not wokeism now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're advocating for the annihilation of Jews. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=85.36s)]
*  These are hate crimes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=89.36s)]
*  The rhetoric are directly from radical Islam. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=90.6s)]
*  And pretty soon, we're going to understand exactly what they mean. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=94.2s)]
*  One of our producers here was telling me a story. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=98.6s)]
*  He lives about 10 minutes away from the local synagogue. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=102.0s)]
*  It was surrounded by pro-Palestinian protesters, pro-Hamas supporters that are there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=104.88s)]
*  If it's not about Jews, if it's not about the people, then why are you surrounding a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=109.58s)]
*  synagogue? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=115.16s)]
*  Please explain to me how that's okay. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=116.16s)]
*  What would happen if you surrounded a mosque? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=117.72s)]
*  What would be the reaction toward that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=120.08s)]
*  Pretty soon, we have to take all of these folks that are having the Hamas flag, saying [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=122.48s)]
*  to the river, from the river to the sea, at their words. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=127.44s)]
*  They want to annihilate Jews. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=130.16s)]
*  It's just that plain and simple. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=132.2s)]
*  Do you know what was also in that spot, Lawrence? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=134.16s)]
*  There was also the shot of the hospital, which Islamic Jihad blew up. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=136.16s)]
*  It's been debunked. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=139.84s)]
*  It was the IDF. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=140.84s)]
*  Did she put it in the 30-second spot, condemning her Democratic president? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because we know where she stands. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=147.44s)]
*  I mean, she's not coy of where she stands. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=150.6s)]
*  I don't think we should be coy as well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=154.88s)]
*  Another person who wasn't coy was Senator Bernie Sanders, and he refused to condemn her. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=157.32s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=163.12s)]
*  There are credible reports from agencies across the world and, you know, the United States. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=165.48s)]
*  We are hurtling towards the genocide of Palestinians. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=172.28s)]
*  That is not an isolated view. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  What's going on right now is a harasha. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=179.0s)]
*  We don't have to quibble about words. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=182.04s)]
*  Thousands of men, women and children are being killed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=184.2s)]
*  It has got to end right now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=186.88s)]
*  Well, somebody on the left did chastise her, and that would be Representative Elisa Slotkin. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  She's the only Jewish member of the delegation from the great state of Michigan. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  She said, regarding from the river to the sea, she said, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=200.92s)]
*  If I knew that a phrase I had used had hurt any of my constituents, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=204.12s)]
*  I would apologize and retract it no matter its origin. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=208.6s)]
*  I ask the same of you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=211.96s)]
*  And a very notable position from Senator Bernie Sanders, who is, of course, a Jewish American himself. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=213.96s)]
*  And at the last little bit of what Pramila Jayapal said is that she says we are hurtling towards the genocide of Palestinians. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  I think a good follow-up question for her there would be, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=227.6s)]
*  Well then, how do you explain the fact that Israel has dropped hundreds of thousands of flyers, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=230.68s)]
*  sent six million text messages to Palestinians telling them to leave? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=236.08s)]
*  And if you don't, you're taking your own life into your hands. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=241.0s)]
*  And they set up a corridor for them to get out, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=242.76s)]
*  and it's up to Egypt to open up the Rafah Pass in order to get them through the gate. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=245.2s)]
*  We've gotten 300 Americans who are in Gaza out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=250.88s)]
*  There's more, I think at least 100, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Another 100? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=256.0s)]
*  One of the problems with the situation in Gaza City though is we've heard from the IDF [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  that people who got the leaflets, got the text message, got the phone call, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=261.64s)]
*  they tried to leave and then the Hamas people are shooting at them, so they got to stay in their house. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=265.36s)]
*  Right, but you know there's some great video out there that shows exactly them popping up from the tunnels right inside the hospital. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  You see where they've been targeted right into the tunnel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=278.56s)]
*  So, you know, there is a 2000 bomb that was dropped. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=281.92s)]
*  I get it. It was a bunker buster because there's a subterranean subway down beneath, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  down beneath there full of Hamas killers. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=290.76s)]
*  But for the most part, they've been extremely disciplined in their targeting. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=294.32s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=299.36s)]
*  Well, also Brian, I think it's important to note that some of the people that are there still stand with Hamas as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=300.32s)]
*  So, I mean, we've had reporters on the ground to get these people and talk to them, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  and they're supposed to be moderates, but their rhetoric is not moderated at all. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=311.24s)]
*  Yeah, they might be Hamas anyway. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  So, I think that's important to note when we're talking about these people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=318.4s)]
*  Yeah, they don't wear jerseys. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=320.12s)]
*  They just, they dress like civilians, but they're really killers. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=321.52s)]
*  I'm Steve Juicy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=325.64s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaaCdEHgSqk&t=326.52s)]
