# Man charged for sinister threats against Tulsi Gabbard, husband
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ)
*  Fox News alert, Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, releasing, releasing files [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  pertaining to the 1968 assassination of RFK. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=5.7s)]
*  Just moments ago, this came out public. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=11.98s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard joins us now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=13.9s)]
*  Great to see you, Madam Director. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=16.42s)]
*  Nice to see you, Brian. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=18.34s)]
*  You've taken 10,000 pages, you found them in boxes, you put them online. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=19.98s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=25.86s)]
*  What did they say that caught you maybe by surprise or will find the most interesting? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=26.86s)]
*  Well, Brian, first of all, this came about because President Trump promised the American [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=30.56s)]
*  people that his administration would be one of maximum transparency. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=35.56s)]
*  And one of the first things that he did when he came back into the Oval Office was issue [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  an executive order that said, we need to release all the documents that we have unredacted [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  on the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=51.92s)]
*  Luther King Jr. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=56.82s)]
*  So we did the initial release of the previously never had been unredacted documents related [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  to President Kennedy's assassination. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=65.68s)]
*  And what we have just released here today is 10,000 pages that have been sitting in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=68.38s)]
*  boxes within the National Archives that had never been digitized or viewed publicly before. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=72.86s)]
*  These are documents related to the government's investigation into the assassination, documents [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=78.7s)]
*  related to discussions that were going on in other countries, State Department cables [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=84.62s)]
*  around the assassination, and a lot of the questions and theories that were being posed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=90.72s)]
*  throughout this investigation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=95.86s)]
*  But I think a lot of people, most people have never seen before. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=97.08s)]
*  The significance of this is huge. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=102.08s)]
*  It's been nearly 60 years since Senator Kennedy was assassinated. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=104.36s)]
*  We're obviously not stopping here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=109.06s)]
*  We discovered 10,000 pages at National Archives. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=111.36s)]
*  We sent people out to hunt through different warehouses at the FBI and CIA knowing there [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=114.56s)]
*  are likely other documents that have not yet been turned over to National Archives. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=119.66s)]
*  And I tell you, just the other day, we discovered over 50,000 additional pages solely around [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  assassination that we have over 100 people at National Archives going through and scanning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=130.96s)]
*  And that will be the second release that we'll have here shortly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=137.08s)]
*  So the Ambassador Hotel is where it took place. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=141.24s)]
*  So Hans Saran is the one serving life sentence for the murder of a Palestinian immigrant [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=143.24s)]
*  mad apparently of the president of the senator and presidential candidates loyalty to Israel. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=148.4s)]
*  And this is what RFK Jr., who's now HHS secretary, said in 2018. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=156.4s)]
*  He said, I went there because I was curious and disturbed by what I had seen in the evidence. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=162.4s)]
*  I was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=166.84s)]
*  My father was the chief law enforcement officer in the country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=170.12s)]
*  I think it would have been disturbed him if someone was put in jail for a crime they didn't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=172.76s)]
*  commit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=177.88s)]
*  And he indicated that there might have been a second gunman. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=178.88s)]
*  You told him these documents were coming out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=181.18s)]
*  Did he indicate to you that he thought there might have been somebody else involved? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=184.2s)]
*  You know, Secretary Kennedy had the opportunity to review these documents before the release [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=188.56s)]
*  occurred. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  But as you point out there in his quote, he's already spent a lot of time, as you can imagine [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=196.04s)]
*  throughout his life, trying to seek the truth here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=200.5s)]
*  And what you'll find, and as folks go to archives.gov slash RFK, they will see a number of documents [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=204.16s)]
*  that really support the questions that Secretary Kennedy has been asking for decades around [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=211.96s)]
*  who really killed his father. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=216.88s)]
*  There, for example, was a woman who ran away from the scene of the shooting, yelling, we [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  got him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  She yelled, we shot him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=228.38s)]
*  We shot him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=229.68s)]
*  There are other documents there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=231.2s)]
*  I mentioned State Department cables that showed different countries were sending messages [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=232.28s)]
*  to each other around Senator Kennedy's assassination, saying that he had been assassinated, but [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=237.46s)]
*  that was before he was actually killed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=244.86s)]
*  So there are a lot of different questions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=248.36s)]
*  I think in my view these documents provide the background to more questions than answers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=249.82000000000002s)]
*  We'll see what the next 50,000 pages brings forward. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  So there was somebody who gave you the threatening messages, wanted to take your life, and he's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=259.26s)]
*  been arrested. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=265.42s)]
*  This is from Ali Kabar Mohammed Amin, Al Kabar Mohammed Amin, 24 years old from Georgia. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=266.54s)]
*  He said to you to prepare to die and to your husband, tell your wife basically to be loyal [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=272.54s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin and obey his orders. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=277.82s)]
*  Your thoughts about his capture and the threat? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, first of all, this is a radicalized individual who started sending direct threats [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=283.86s)]
*  both to me and my husband. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  Weeks ago he found my husband's phone number and was constantly texting him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=294.38s)]
*  There are well over hundreds of text messages, called him numerous times a day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=300.1s)]
*  Of course he didn't answer the call, but with very, very explicit direct threats. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=304.46000000000004s)]
*  We know where you live. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=309.62s)]
*  We will come after you, come after your wife, come after your family. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=310.86s)]
*  You will be killed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=314.38s)]
*  And I received similar threats myself. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=315.7s)]
*  I want to say thank you to the FBI and the US Marshals and local law enforcement there [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=319.38s)]
*  in Georgia who, when presented with evidence, conducted an investigation and quickly brought [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=323.7s)]
*  him in and arrested him. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=330.98s)]
*  It has obviously stopped the threats from coming in, but these things have to be taken [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=333.46s)]
*  seriously. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=337.94s)]
*  Again, when we look at the tragedies our country has experienced in the past, we look at the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=338.94s)]
*  fact that our own president had two assassination attempts in his life just recently. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=344.22s)]
*  What happens when political differences turn into political violence? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=350.14000000000004s)]
*  They have to be taken seriously. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=355.14000000000004s)]
*  It's hard enough to serve, but let alone have to worry about your own life at the same time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=356.94000000000005s)]
*  Thank goodness they got this guy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=361.14000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for joining us today, the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=368.54s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=369.54s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINzNTq9QrQ&t=370.54s)]
