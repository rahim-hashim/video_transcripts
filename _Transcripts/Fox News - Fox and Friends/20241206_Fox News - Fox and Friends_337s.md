# CEO murder suspect reportedly took bus from ATL to NYC, used fake ID at hostel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0)
*  All right, a Fox News alert. The manhunt for the gunman who murdered the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Healthcare CEO enters its third day right now. Chainley Painter is here in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=7.9s)]
*  studio and with the latest evidence that could solve the case. That's right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=12.16s)]
*  Hey, Steve. So police appear to be closing in on the identity of the man [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=16.68s)]
*  suspected of gunning down 50 year old Brian Thompson Wednesday morning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=20.36s)]
*  outside of New York City Hotel. Police sources revealing to Fox that they have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=24.0s)]
*  a cell phone they believe was dropped by the suspect near the scene with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=28.32s)]
*  fingerprints and a water bottle purchased by the suspect at a nearby [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  Starbucks that is being used to build a DNA profile. We are also learning the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=37.24s)]
*  suspect arrived in the city more than a week ago on a Greyhound bus from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=41.92s)]
*  Atlanta before checking into a hostel in the Upper West Side using a fake [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=45.44s)]
*  idea and paying in cash. These photos were taken at that hostel. The first [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=50.2s)]
*  images to show the alleged masked assassin's face smiling. Reportedly in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=54.52s)]
*  a moment he pulled his face covering down to flirt with the hostile clerk. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=59.6s)]
*  Police sources saying he shared a room there with at least two other men. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=63.82000000000001s)]
*  What I heard is that he stayed on the photo seven like really, really next [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=69.22s)]
*  to the bathroom, like right next to mine. I'm used to violence because I'm [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=74.56s)]
*  from Rio de Janeiro. There's a lot there, but like not the kinds of like cold [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=79.76s)]
*  and meticulous professional killing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=85.6s)]
*  Police are also homing in on the type of gun used in the murder. A firearms [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=89.52s)]
*  expert telling Fox this quote. It is a very unique pistol and they don't make [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=94.24s)]
*  that many of them. If it is the gun, they will be able to narrow him down to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=98.64s)]
*  a very small number of purchases or purchasers. And while a motive is still [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=104.38s)]
*  not clear, as reported yesterday, the suspect left behind possible clues in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=109.48s)]
*  the words denied to pose defend written on shell casings and live rounds left [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  there at the scene. Possibly a message to the murdered CEO of one of the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=117.12s)]
*  largest health care companies in the world. Steve, lots of more details. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=121.28s)]
*  Chandley, thank you very much. Let's bring in Frank Loverage. He's a former [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=125.28s)]
*  Secret Service special agent in charge of all sorts of stuff. You worked with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=129.1s)]
*  George W Bush, Barack Obama. It's good to have you. Thank you for having me. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=133.6s)]
*  Okay, so we've got a much better picture of this guy because when he checked in, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  apparently he was wearing a black mask, a face mask and starts flirting with the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  hostile clerk. And she said, I got to see your face probably to check you in. He [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=146.2s)]
*  pulled it down. He's smiling. We got a better idea. Where does it go from here? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=150.72s)]
*  Well, I think they're closing in on him now. It's been, uh, it's the fourth day [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=154.76s)]
*  right now. We're looking at, uh, we have a facial recognition on him now. We've [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  got some DNA possibly off of one of the items he had water bottle. Then we got a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  phone we need to look into. We know we've tracked him coming from Atlanta [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=166.44s)]
*  from the south on a on a bus arriving at Port Authority. Um, so we've got great [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=170.4s)]
*  photos from that. Hey, look, NYPD did an amazing job of putting this together. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=174.88s)]
*  I run those camera feeds together and basically pinning them down and getting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=179.12s)]
*  these great shots. So I think it's gonna be just a moment of time before we have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=182.72s)]
*  them in custody. Well, it does seem like he made some sort of mistakes and the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=185.94s)]
*  cops here are good and they now got a pretty good picture of who they suspect. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=191.28s)]
*  All right, Frank, we also have some pretty good pictures of something nobody [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=196.44s)]
*  can explain in New Jersey. I got a note from our doctor, Dr Ken, uh, yesterday [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=201.04s)]
*  and said, What's the deal with the drones? Because these mysterious drones [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=206.84s)]
*  have been, uh, flying over portions of New Jersey. And as you can see right [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=210.2s)]
*  there, that that was Bernardsville Wednesday, not too far from Bedminster [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=214.8s)]
*  where the president has got his golf course. Correct. What? What do we know [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=218.96s)]
*  about this? I don't think we know a whole lot about it. It's been reported [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=223.4s)]
*  since November 25th, been several weeks now, and it's pretty obvious. Multiple [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=226.6s)]
*  reports coming in. Now we've got a military research facility in that area. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=231.6s)]
*  We have a pharmaceutical company in that area. We also have the Trump's golf [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=235.4s)]
*  courses in that area as well. So we need to be concerned about that. But we [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=239.28s)]
*  need to identify who's flying these drones. And if they're not friends of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=243.12s)]
*  the government, we need to go ahead and make sure we, uh, we interview these [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=247.8s)]
*  people and find out what their intentions are. Well, the acting secret [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=250.56s)]
*  service director said that autonomous canines are guarding Mar-a-Lago. And I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=253.28s)]
*  know when we were at the R and C in Milwaukee over the summer, they did have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=259.88s)]
*  drones, fixed drones that they had just hovering above it. Right. But this, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=264.08s)]
*  these have running lights and they're moving. So it's not like they're just [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=269.92s)]
*  taking a look at everything going on. Yeah, we don't want mapping the golf [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=273.46s)]
*  course looking for vulnerabilities. Like we saw in Mar-a-Lago, there's an area [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=276.68s)]
*  that photographs were taken of the president when he was golfing. These are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=279.64s)]
*  vulnerabilities areas. Could it be someone out there mapping this area to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=282.56s)]
*  find out advantage of place that they could set up for an attack? I mean, this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=286.32s)]
*  is something we got to look into. But bottom line is, I think we should, we [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=290.56s)]
*  should know who these people are. They're flying these drones. Do you have [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  a guess? I think it's us. You think it's us? Oh, I think it is. Uh, I mean, by [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=296.28s)]
*  this time, I are Intel people. It could be a research development part of a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=301.24s)]
*  project they're working on. I know Amazon is in that area as well. Um, so [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  who knows what's going on out there, but three weeks has gone by and we [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=309.36s)]
*  haven't seen a lot of reports on who these individuals are. And it could be [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=313.36s)]
*  Amazon. Uh, Jeff Bezos, call us, call Frank. I've just taken a shot at it, but [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  indeed. Thank you, Steve. Frank. Thank you very much. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A66v6v1JGJ0&t=323.36s)]
