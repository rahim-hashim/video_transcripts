# Gutfeld's new show quizzes people after 90 days in isolation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U)
*  Today on Fox Nation, Greg Gutfeld premiering the show we've been telling you about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a brand new game show. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=5.0s)]
*  Can four contestants tell real news from fake news after they have spent 90 days in isolation? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=6.5s)]
*  You've been here for how long? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=15.0s)]
*  For 45 days. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=16.0s)]
*  So do you... [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=17.5s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=19.0s)]
*  Oh dear. Wait a minute. I'm confused here. I was told there were five people. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, one of them couldn't make it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=24.0s)]
*  She just couldn't take this? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=25.0s)]
*  Couldn't take it away from her family so long? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=26.5s)]
*  Like we're literally here with nobody. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=29.0s)]
*  For three months these poor souls have been cut off from the world. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=30.5s)]
*  No TV, no phones, no social media. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=34.0s)]
*  Just time. Endless time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=36.5s)]
*  Oh my gosh. Joining us now, those four that did make it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=40.0s)]
*  The show is called What Did I Miss? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=44.0s)]
*  And we have contestants. We have Sonny and Mark, Allegra and Mike. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=46.0s)]
*  Thanks y'all for being here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=49.0s)]
*  I've been dying to see this show. I know it premieres tonight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=50.5s)]
*  What was it like? Were there any fights? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=53.5s)]
*  Of course there was. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=56.0s)]
*  There were fights, of course. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=57.0s)]
*  Okay, how did y'all deal? No social media, no computers, no phones. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=58.0s)]
*  You couldn't talk. Do y'all have kids? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=62.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=63.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=64.0s)]
*  How did you... What did you do? Did you miss them so much? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=64.5s)]
*  I missed mine so much. I know he did. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=67.0s)]
*  We just wrote them letters and couldn't receive any back though. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=69.5s)]
*  But we just wrote them letters and was like, we love you. Don't forget about us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=73.5s)]
*  Right. Sonny, what was the hardest thing for you? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=77.0s)]
*  Literally, it was a crazy experience ever. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=79.0s)]
*  You're completely isolated from everything. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=81.0s)]
*  So like out of 350 million people in the United States, us four knew the least. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=83.0s)]
*  We had no idea because there was no phones, no devices, no newspaper, no radio, nothing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=87.5s)]
*  Complete isolation. It was like Amish boot camp. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=92.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=95.5s)]
*  No electronics at all. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=96.5s)]
*  Mark, what did you miss the most? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=97.5s)]
*  I'll probably say I missed my nephews the most. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=99.5s)]
*  Then second to that, I missed my phone. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=102.5s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=104.5s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, so it was kind of hard to adapt. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=105.5s)]
*  But it was pretty easy to adapt after the phone, maybe after a week or so. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=107.5s)]
*  But missing my nephews was probably... [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=112.0s)]
*  Did you see them first when you came in? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=114.5s)]
*  I made sure I saw them. Oh yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=116.5s)]
*  I got a nice meal from my aunt's house first. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=118.5s)]
*  Then I got to see them right after. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=120.5s)]
*  Allegra, how about for you? What was the hardest? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=122.5s)]
*  For me, it was my husband and my kids. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=124.5s)]
*  But honestly, besides that, my dog. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=127.5s)]
*  Because they don't know where you went. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=130.5s)]
*  So I was just disappeared for three months and she had no idea if I was coming back. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=132.5s)]
*  So it was really hard. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=137.5s)]
*  And Mike, y'all were in upstate New York. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=138.5s)]
*  You were in this house. We just saw. What did you do during the day? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=140.5s)]
*  And what was it like to not have social media? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=143.5s)]
*  Was it kind of nice? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=145.5s)]
*  The social media aspect and the technology was nice to kind of cut away. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=146.5s)]
*  Because you can... [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=150.5s)]
*  There's a reconnection, I think, that happens especially with creativity [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=151.5s)]
*  and how you think and just your soul, mind and spirit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=155.5s)]
*  But we played games. We watched movies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=159.5s)]
*  I played around on some music. We did crafts. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=162.5s)]
*  Oh God, I felt like the staff Bob Ross. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=166.5s)]
*  Paint and rocks, paint by numbers, crochet, anything. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=168.5s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God. But there's nothing else to do. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=171.5s)]
*  You're literally locked up. You have nothing to do. So you have to make it work. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=173.5s)]
*  It had to make you appreciate what your lives are really like. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=176.5s)]
*  Are any of y'all news junkies? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=179.5s)]
*  Because there was a lot of news that happened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=181.5s)]
*  Y'all were secluded right before the inauguration on January 20th, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=182.5s)]
*  So you missed all of that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=187.5s)]
*  You've missed everything that Donald Trump has done over the last three or four months. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=188.5s)]
*  And we're still trying to catch up. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=191.5s)]
*  We're still catching up until now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=193.5s)]
*  Anything that your family was like, you didn't know that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=194.5s)]
*  Everything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=198.5s)]
*  I'd probably say certain trades that happened in the NBA. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=201.5s)]
*  And major events like Donald Trump passing terrorists on every single country on earth. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=204.5s)]
*  I didn't think this would actually be something he did do, but it was pretty incredible. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=212.5s)]
*  So after y'all spent 90 days alone, just the four of you, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=217.5s)]
*  then y'all came back to New York and y'all were in the studio and a live studio audience. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=221.5s)]
*  And Greg was asking y'all questions for the game show. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=225.5s)]
*  What was true and what was not. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=227.5s)]
*  And here's a clip of, I think Greg was asking y'all if there was a war between Canada and the United States. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=229.5s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=235.5s)]
*  So here's the truth. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=257.5s)]
*  In reality, the only war you missed with Canada was the trade war. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=263.5s)]
*  And that's the end of our interview. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=287.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for watching. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBt2ggwDT6U&t=290.5s)]
