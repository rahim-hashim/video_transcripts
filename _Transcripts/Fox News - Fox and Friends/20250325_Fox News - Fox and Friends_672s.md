*  with this more business administration where they were handing out loans at [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=105.88s)]
*  330 million dollars worth of loans to people under the age of 11 I think the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=109.56s)]
*  youngest Kelly was a nine-month-old who got a hundred thousand dollar loan that's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=113.96000000000001s)]

*  loans that is something the current president is trying to wind down back to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=123.76s)]
*  you hey Peter before you go the number one story everybody's talking about from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=128.56s)]
*  the White House is and it's a headline in the New York Post Trump team [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=132.96s)]
*  accidentally added lefty editor to secret text group planning Yemeni raids [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=137.4s)]
*  what are people saying do you have any scoop today [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=142.04s)]
*  well they did promise to be the most transparent White House ever right I [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  guess adding a journalist to group chat like that would be consistent with that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=150.52s)]
*  promise but I think that's what they meant [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=155.28s)]
*  right but I have heard that Mike Waltz is telling people that he has no idea [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=157.28s)]
*  how this happened he has never met Jeffrey Goldberg he has never spoken to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg so if the story is that Jeffrey Goldberg is invited by Michael [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=169.76s)]
*  Waltz to this group that the NSC says is a real check group they looked at it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  they said this is a thread that they think is all legitimate Pete Hicks that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  though claims that there were no war plans shared but Mike Waltz says he has [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=188.88s)]
*  no idea how this happened and he is saying that signal the encrypted [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=194.0s)]
*  messaging act is rather app is allowed at various government agencies and we [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=200.08s)]
*  looked it up there is guidance for highly targeted individuals to use and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=206.08s)]
*  to end encrypted software like this free apps signal whatsapp to try to avoid [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=210.2s)]
*  being hacked right so wow it's Peter that's fascinating so you're saying that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=218.2s)]
*  you have learned it's okay for government officials to be using signal [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=223.68s)]
*  yeah I actually we pulled a quote if you give me one second I have it in my email [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=227.84s)]
*  here from the CISA guidance and part of it says adopt a free messaging [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=232.6s)]
*  application for secure communications that guarantees end-to-end encryption [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=238.96s)]
*  they want that for highly targeted individuals and they say well no single [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=244.08s)]
*  solution eliminates all risks implementing these best practices [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=249.12s)]
*  significantly enhances protection so okay all right so well that's interesting [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=252.84s)]
*  moving the story forward yeah and it is worth it's also worth you know we've been asking everybody about this I have heard from a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=258.44s)]
*  different senior administration official that they are denying these reports that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=265.08s)]
*  Waltz is on the chopping block so well and that's what I was going to ask you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=270.36s)]
*  about because the Wall Street the Politico says half the president's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=273.64s)]
*  advisors say that Waltz is in trouble the Wall Street Journal is reporting [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=277.32s)]
*  that President Trump is angry at him but at the same time a bunch of Democrats [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=281.48s)]
*  want the president to fire Waltz over this but given the fact that Democrats [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  want it that's probably job security for Mike Waltz because the last thing he [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=291.76s)]
*  wants to do is cave to Democrats and this reporter Jeffrey Goldberg is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=295.72s)]
*  somebody that President Trump and his senior advisors do not like they are [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=301.36s)]
*  not big fans of the reporting that he has done about President Trump over the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=307.44s)]
*  last couple years and so that raised some questions last night about why [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=311.04s)]
*  would Mike Waltz have this phone number in his phone at all for Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  because you need to have the digits in there to invite somebody to a signal [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=321.8s)]
*  chat but he is saying that they've never spoken and they have never met so that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=326.24s)]
*  Peter is that is the the story on the first day of this probe which is yeah I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  totally hear you on Jeffrey Goldberg I mean I was press secretary with the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=339.88s)]
*  suckers and losers story I immediately found a dozen sources to discredit his [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=343.14s)]
*  reporting I was sitting here with you guys with the Vanessa Gullion reporting [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  which was discredited by Ben Williamson Mark Meadows among others NSC though to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=350.76s)]
*  their credit they own this Peter they said this is an authentic chain they did [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=355.34s)]
*  not try to deny it but my question here I mean Jeffrey Goldberg I watched him [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  last night he intimates that his name popped up as JG in the signal chat I [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=365.16s)]
*  would think it Lawrence Jones is like a signal expert over here JG if it pops [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  up as such in the chat you got to be in someone's phone who is that yeah JG I [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=374.1s)]
*  don't know do you know the White House well there's speculation that it was [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=379.5s)]
*  meant to be Jameson Greer the US trade representative but that at this point is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=384.24s)]
*  just speculation explain there's no way to know but what what I kind of am [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=389.4s)]
*  curious about why did JG leave the chat I guess everybody that was on there got [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  an alert oh JG has left the the group chat on signal I miss that okay wow yeah [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  and so I you know you got to stick around a little bit see what else they're [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  gonna talk about and I do think there's probably some level of from the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=411.76s)]
*  reporting about this there is probably some level of jealousy from everybody [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=416.32s)]
*  else writing about this that they were not added well that's interesting Peter [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=419.32s)]
*  thank you for moving the story so Mike Waltz says you know in speaking to him [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=424.64s)]
*  he said I have no idea how my phone number got into the contact info if this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=431.12s)]
*  is a government phone so you're the National Security Advisor and they say [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=436.68s)]
*  hey here's your phone guys welcome to your first day this is gonna be the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=439.96s)]
*  dress code this is where the halls are this where the well this we're gonna do [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=443.06s)]
*  here's where the men's room is do they hand you the government phone and could [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=445.74s)]
*  someone else be loading your contacts like I'm obviously loading my signal [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=449.66s)]
*  contacts but is somebody else like a staff for loading your contacts and was [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=453.42s)]
*  that person confused so I you know maybe the trade rep how why would the trade [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=458.22s)]
*  rep be in that well just let you're looking at the substance yeah kind of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=462.66s)]
*  makes sense it does what do they say only 3% JD JD Vance in pushing back [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=466.1s)]
*  says only 3% of our commerce goes through there Europe's got 40% why [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=470.86s)]
*  are we doing the work for Europe so that's maybe why a trade rep might be in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=475.66s)]
*  there yeah what I'm not making excuses just [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=479.62s)]
*  no piece together and I said first of all I said from the very beginning yeah in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=482.22s)]
*  the first hour the signal thing doesn't bother that's true you said signal [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  because they all use it they do and I'm glad I didn't know there was official [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=491.94000000000005s)]
*  guidance to use it and I just know that this is the platform they do it because [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=495.70000000000005s)]
*  they find it to be secure number two as it relates to the intelligence being [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=499.26000000000005s)]
*  shared back and forth my question is what is he talking about is he talking [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=504.66s)]
*  about just conversations because in order for maps and stuff that stuff [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=508.62s)]
*  doesn't leave and with signal you would have to download that on your phone you [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=512.82s)]
*  can't get a map on you could but you can't get a military map unless you have [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=516.94s)]
*  a secretary or someone at a high level downloading stuff to their phone they [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=522.16s)]
*  don't download look at the repetitive they don't they don't do that that's on [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=525.92s)]
*  you can't even have the phone and that parts of the Pentagon that's all on [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=528.9s)]
*  hardwire and all that type of so I'm just not buying you know maps and stuff [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=534.06s)]
*  of a taxable now maybe they were having conversation to that point the last [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=539.38s)]
*  point I'm gonna make and I just put a bow on it I think Mike Walt is is known [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=544.5s)]
*  as a trusted ally of the president I think if the president is fierce this [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=549.66s)]
*  morning he's furious about it being sloppy he doesn't like slapping this he [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boKY-0aMfE&t=554.42s)]
