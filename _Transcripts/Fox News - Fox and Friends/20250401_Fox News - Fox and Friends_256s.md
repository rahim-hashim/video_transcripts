# Kid Rock reveals key details from Trump's meeting with Bill Maher
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w)
*  All right, Bill Maher may be one of President Trump's most vocal critics, but that didn't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=0.0s)]
*  stop him from getting an invitation to dinner at the White House last night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=4.7s)]
*  So how did it go? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=8.94s)]
*  Music superstar, Kid Rock arranged it all and he joins us now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=10.1s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=13.94s)]
*  Good morning kids. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=16.42s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=17.42s)]
*  All right, tell us what happened from start to finish in 30 seconds. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=18.42s)]
*  In 30 seconds, I went on Bill's show, I went on his podcast and I said, man, you know, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=24.34s)]
*  nothing happens if people don't break bread together and meet face to face. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=28.86s)]
*  He's been one of the president's hardest critics. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=32.3s)]
*  And we came to dinner, me, Bill, Dana White, and it could not have been better. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=34.46s)]
*  Everyone was so surprised, so pleasant. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=41.32s)]
*  The most shocking thing to me was, you know, Bill's obviously a very big liberal, been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=43.7s)]
*  very hard on the president, but he's donated a lot of money to other politicians. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=47.32s)]
*  You know, you've had Biden, Clinton, Obama, everybody. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=50.58s)]
*  He had never been to the White House and the president was so gracious. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=53.64s)]
*  He took us up to the private residence. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=56.68s)]
*  We saw the Gettysburg address in the Lincoln bedroom and I was like, you've never been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=58.6s)]
*  here, Bill. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=62.14s)]
*  And I was like, how about this? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=63.14s)]
*  President Trump, you know, extending this olive branch and like, and we talked about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=64.62s)]
*  things we had in common, you know, ending wokeness, you know, securing the border. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=68.18s)]
*  You know, the president was asking him what he thought about policy, you know, going on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=73.8s)]
*  with Iran and Israel and things. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=77.3s)]
*  It just meant it blew my mind. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=80.18s)]
*  I was, you know, very, very proud. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=82.0s)]
*  Bob, do you think he walked away liking him? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=84.36s)]
*  Because you know, Trump is the type of person that you got to meet him to understand it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=86.6s)]
*  100%. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=91.72s)]
*  100%. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=92.72s)]
*  Me and Dana both said there was like, there's never been that's ever, ever met the president [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=93.72s)]
*  in any scenario that's walked away without saying like, wow, what a great guy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=99.92s)]
*  So funny, so engaging. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  He's so smart. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=105.24s)]
*  And absolutely, Bill even said to me, you know, after that, he goes, wow, that was, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  you know, everybody's mind was kind of blown. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  Even the presidents, I think, because the president called me late night last night [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=112.7s)]
*  and, you know, everyone was a little suspect about going into this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=115.98s)]
*  And even the president kind of alerted to me a little bit like, what do you got me doing? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=119.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=122.78s)]
*  I go, man, we're just trying to show people that, you know, even though we've been pretty [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=123.78s)]
*  hard on each other, that when you get face to face, maybe we can have a little more civility [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  in this country and try to bring people together. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=130.74s)]
*  You know, that was my whole intention. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  You know, that's that was so important because so many people now are in their own little [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=135.74s)]
*  silos and they don't even talk to the people across the street because they voted for somebody [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=140.56s)]
*  else. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=144.28s)]
*  You showed that two of the biggest, most vocal people on both sides of the aisle can get [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=145.28s)]
*  break bread, have a good time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=151.36s)]
*  And ultimately, I'm sure you took a bunch of pictures. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=153.6s)]
*  We did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=157.52s)]
*  Well, we kind of checked our phones. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=158.52s)]
*  You know, the president put his phone on a table and he said everybody, you know, the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=159.52s)]
*  guys kind of took ours and the White House took some pictures, which I'm sure they'll [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=162.56s)]
*  put out at some point because I can't wait to have one of those. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=166.2s)]
*  I was clowning around the White House all day taking pictures in the bowling alley and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  this running around in my in my flashy as your son called it, Peter, my get shot out [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  of a cannon suit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=178.22s)]
*  That was funny. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=179.22s)]
*  Evil Knievel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=180.22s)]
*  So so so you did this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=181.22s)]
*  You set this up. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=183.62s)]
*  Do you sense that anything will change with Bill Maher show from here? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=185.06s)]
*  Because I think he's been very fair, to be honest. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Out of all those shows, what do you think? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=192.3s)]
*  It's my hope that, you know, that, you know, and and and God bless Bill, too, for he even [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=196.58s)]

*  Hollywood stuff, it would be great for you to get thrown out and it'd probably be good [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=206.58s)]
*  for you to jump down and be like, you know, I can't stand this guy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=209.7s)]
*  And he goes, Bob, I'm not going to I'm not going to sabotage something that potentially [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=213.18s)]
*  could bring us and other people together, you know, just to show that, you know, that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=216.74s)]
*  family member that you kind of divided with over politics or that person in at the school [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=220.86s)]

*  maybe we'll just you know, hey, we can find things we have in common. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=229.24s)]
*  And it gets so easy to go on social media. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AyE2b4K3w&t=232.08s)]
