# House Republicans widen majority with latest Iowa win
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE)
*  24 minutes after the hour now, she's done it again. Congresswoman Marionette Miller Meeks winning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=0.0s)]
*  re-election in the great state of Iowa by fewer than a thousand votes after winning by just six folks [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=6.4s)]
*  back in 2020. Her victory giving the GOP 220 seats in the House and helping her party in the process [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=13.36s)]
*  had a very, and I mean very thin majority. And Congresswoman Marionette Miller Meeks joins us [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=21.04s)]
*  now. It is so great to have you with us. Kevin, it's great to be here with you all in the studio. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=26.56s)]
*  And happy Thanksgiving and obviously Merry Christmas to come. Let me ask you about the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  race itself. When it gets tight like this, and listen, I think viewers at home will acknowledge [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=36.0s)]
*  this too, it seems like whenever they're down to the last and they're counting these ballots late, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=41.12s)]
*  it's like Democrat, Democrat, Democrat. You broke the trend as I show the folks at home [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=46.16s)]
*  just how close the race was. What happened? Well, first and foremost, I'm in a credit Iowa [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=50.96s)]
*  and the Iowa legislature and I was part of that as a state senator for passing good election [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=56.0s)]
*  integrity laws. So, and then having gone through this process of a recount in 2020, we knew what [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  things to look for. And so working with the secretary of state to make sure that they gave [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=66.72s)]
*  clear guidance to the recount boards on what was expected and what was anticipated. And then [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=71.6s)]
*  historically, Iowa has never overturned a three triple digit margin. So we felt pretty secure that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=76.72s)]
*  in 2020, we survived a recount with 47 votes down to six. We were pretty sure that with 801 votes, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=83.68s)]
*  we were going to survive this recount. But, you know, places like California where they're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  still counting ballots weeks after the election, that's outrageous. And so our laws specifically [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  say when ballots have to be in and they have to be at the auditor's office on the day of the election. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=100.0s)]
*  And so that helps. Yeah, I don't want to get you in trouble and go down a rabbit hole. But when I saw [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=105.12s)]
*  that Iowa poll that J.N. Selzer put out, I think a lot of us said, oh, please, you got to be kidding [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=109.92s)]
*  me. And as it turns out, it was off by 17. I think Iowa's pretty consistent. Let me ask you about Doge. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  I guess House and Senate Republicans are going to get a chance to meet with Elon Musk and Vivek [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=123.04s)]
*  Ramaswamy to talk about the Doge. Explain what Doge is and what your expectations are of the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=127.84s)]
*  upcoming meeting. Well, first of all, we're all very excited. One, to have the majority, both in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=134.24s)]
*  the House, the Senate and President Trump back in the White House. And I think all of the nation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=139.68s)]
*  feels hopeful. You can just feel the difference in the atmosphere and people's attitude. So [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=145.12s)]
*  we're very grateful for that, to have the trifecta. And one of the things that has been a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=150.32s)]
*  constant challenge for Congress is to work on the administrative branch, so to work on those [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=156.0s)]
*  government agencies. And so an office of government efficiency, we want government to be efficient, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=162.0s)]
*  but also effective. So I think having people that bring a business mindset, having been a small [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=167.68s)]
*  business owner, bringing that business mindset into Congress, looking at agencies, I think can [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  be a very effective strategy. So having Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, both individuals who have [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=178.88s)]
*  started companies, grown companies. And I remember when Elon Musk took over Twitter, and so there [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  were some people let go, and it was going to be cataclysmic, and Twitter wasn't going to be able [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=192.0s)]
*  to survive. Well, now we have X, and it's doing extremely well, and there's an opportunity for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=196.88s)]
*  people to have free speech once again. So we're looking forward to working with both Elon Musk [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  and Vivek Ramaswamy on making government both efficient and effective. And make America greater [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  again. Marionette Miller-Meeks. So great to see you, Congresswoman. Congratulations, and we will [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  see you again real soon. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=216.48s)]
*  you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57eu9zfoxE&t=226.88s)]
