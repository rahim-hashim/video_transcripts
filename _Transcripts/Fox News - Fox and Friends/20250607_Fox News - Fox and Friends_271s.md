# Abrego Garcia 'could’ve been stopped' years ago by Biden admin: Former ICE director
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y)
*  Kilmore Abrego Garcia, the suspected MS-13 member imprisoned in El Salvador, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  returns to the U.S. to face a number of human trafficking charges in Tennessee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=5.92s)]
*  Let's break down the indictment. All right, count one includes conspiracy to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=10.16s)]
*  unlawfully transport illegal aliens for money. Now Garcia faces up to ten years [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=15.3s)]
*  in prison and a quarter of a million dollars in fines for that one. Count two [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=20.8s)]
*  covers the physical transportation of illegal immigrants. Now here's what [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=26.2s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi said yesterday about the indictment. He was a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=30.96s)]
*  smuggler of humans and children and women. He made over a hundred trips. The [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=36.3s)]
*  defendant abused undocumented alien females according to co-conspirators. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  This defendant trafficked firearms and narcotics. A co-conspirator also alleges [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=50.92s)]
*  the defendant played a role in the murder of a rival gang members mother. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=57.64s)]
*  Former ICE acting director Jonathan Fahey is here to react. Jonathan, thanks [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=62.52s)]
*  for being with us. So let me just start with this. Do these indictments [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=67.84s)]
*  completely put to bed the idea that we're just dealing with a Maryland man [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  here? I certainly hope so because we've seen so many absurd statements by these [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=76.36s)]
*  Democratic politicians. Maryland man, Maryland father and it's just absurd. And [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=83.0s)]
*  you played a clip I think at the beginning of your show about Senator [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=88.76s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen saying all he cared about was due process. But if you look [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=91.92s)]
*  back at his earlier statements he was actually defaming ICE officers saying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=96.28s)]
*  they illegally abducted Maryland man and referred to him as a constituent. So it's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=100.88s)]
*  funny how they're changing their tune now to say oh we only care about due [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  process. We weren't really advocating for them but that's not true at all. But I [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=110.36s)]
*  hope it puts it to bed and it does show that President Trump is putting public [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  safety ahead of all of these other things and putting the American people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=118.32s)]
*  first which is about time. You brought up Senator Van Hollen. I've heard him say all [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=122.84s)]
*  I care about is the rule of the law. Not this guy, just the rule of law. But if he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=128.36s)]
*  cared about rule of law we never would have gotten to this point right because [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=133.96s)]
*  this guy would have been deported from this country years ago. You're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=138.68s)]
*  absolutely right and none of these Democratic politicians were talking [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=143.96s)]
*  about the rule of law when the Biden administration not only was refusing to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=148.16s)]
*  enforce the immigration law but was encouraging people to break it. But what's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  really important here is he was stopped in 2022 with these illegal aliens in the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=156.64s)]
*  car. This was referred to DHS. They chose not to do anything with it. This was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=162.28s)]
*  under the Biden administration where his DOJ wasn't basically prosecuting any [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=167.2s)]
*  immigration cases. So he could have been stopped in 2022 but they didn't follow [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  the rule of law because they had a political agenda of open borders. I want [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=176.64s)]
*  to get to this as well. California Governor Gavin Newsom says he condemns [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=181.16s)]
*  quote chaotic federal sweeps across California as protesters are clashing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=185.88s)]
*  with ICE agents there. Jonathan, this to me, one it looks very dangerous but two [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=191.92s)]
*  what these protests are doing have to be illegal because they're obstructing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=198.4s)]
*  federal agents. What's your take on this? Yeah, exactly. And this is such a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=203.32s)]
*  cynical ploy that the Democrats are doing all throughout the country is they [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=208.2s)]
*  create the chaos and then portray themselves as standing up to the chaos. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=212.8s)]
*  It's so cynical and it's putting these agents at risk. It's putting members of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=217.24s)]
*  the public at risk. But yeah, they're obstructing these agents doing their [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=221.12s)]
*  duty. And the one one thing that's in particular that's being referenced [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  recently, these agents were serving search warrants, which as you know, are [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=228.56s)]
*  signed by a federal judge. So they're not just there, you know, going rogue. They [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=232.84s)]
*  have authority of a judge. And these Democrats, these politicians are not only [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=237.28s)]
*  standing in their way, they're putting them in danger and they're marginalizing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=241.4s)]
*  them, dehumanizing and putting them in future danger in other operations as [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  well. Yeah, it's absolutely not chaotic. It's completely consistent with the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  judges ruling and the law. Jonathan Fahey, we got to leave it there. Really [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  appreciate your perspective today. Thanks. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJBJ4yar8Y&t=258.12s)]
