# Justice Alito dissents from major deportation ruling: 'Legally questionable'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg)
*  Justice Samuel Alito, dissenting from the Supreme Court, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=0.0s)]
*  ruling blocking deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=4.0s)]
*  saying, quote, in some, literally in the middle of the night, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=8.0s)]
*  the court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=12.0s)]
*  without giving the lower courts a chance to rule. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=16.0s)]
*  This is why the White House releases rap sheets, photos of TDA members [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=20.0s)]
*  it wants to deport. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=25.0s)]
*  Here to react is George Washington, law professor, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=27.0s)]
*  and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=31.0s)]
*  Professor, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=34.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things that us non-lawyers, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=36.0s)]
*  who get confused about a lot of this stuff, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=39.0s)]
*  often sort of wonder about is the process. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=42.0s)]
*  Sometimes judges are defending a process [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=46.0s)]
*  that doesn't make sense to us, and so you have to take a second breath. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=49.0s)]
*  But this is a case where Justice Alito took a torpedo [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=53.0s)]
*  to the actual process of what his colleagues were doing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=58.0s)]
*  And to me, that's very unsettling as somebody who loves the law, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=62.0s)]
*  wants us to protect the law, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=66.0s)]
*  but also doesn't understand what the heck is going on here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, you know, Charlie, you get a sense of the frustration [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=73.0s)]
*  that a number of the members of the court are experiencing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=76.0s)]
*  with this torrent of emergency appeals. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=81.0s)]
*  And what Justice Alito is saying is, you know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=84.0s)]
*  we need to get back to regular order [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=87.0s)]
*  because these cases are coming to us without a record. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=89.0s)]
*  We don't know what the position of lower courts are. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=92.0s)]
*  It's basically an improvisational type of filing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=95.0s)]
*  And Alito is basically saying, I'm having enough of this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=99.0s)]
*  The court earlier basically chastised lower courts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=103.0s)]
*  There is a strong suggestion that they were allowing form shopping. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=108.0s)]
*  They sent one case out of D.C. and said that Judge Bosberg, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=112.0s)]
*  who's currently considering a contempt charge, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=116.0s)]
*  should never have even heard that case, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=118.0s)]
*  which is what a number of us said at the outset, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=121.0s)]
*  that he should never have accepted a case [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=123.0s)]
*  that was actually a habeas case belonging down south. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=125.0s)]
*  So I think you see this level of frustration rising with the justices. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=129.0s)]
*  I expect that what we're going to be seeing here [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=133.0s)]
*  is an effort of the court to create better guideposts for lower courts. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=136.0s)]
*  You know, we just had a Fourth Circuit decision where a conservative judge, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=143.0s)]
*  Judge Wilkinson, said we need mutual respect [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=147.0s)]
*  between the judiciary and executive branches. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=151.0s)]
*  I think the Supreme Court's going to pick up on that theme [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=154.0s)]
*  and say everyone needs to de-escalate and get back to regular order. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=157.0s)]
*  Certainly you would think that with somebody like Chief Justice Roberts, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=161.0s)]
*  who cares so much about protecting the integrity of the court, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=164.0s)]
*  that he would want to do that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=168.0s)]
*  But in this case, it was only a dissent by Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=170.0s)]
*  So do you think that the Chief Justice is listening? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=176.0s)]
*  And do you think the Chief Justice is aware that maybe we do need to bring [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=181.0s)]
*  regular order to the way they handle these things? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=184.0s)]
*  I think he is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=187.0s)]
*  Chief Justice Roberts has always been someone who is an incrementalist, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=190.0s)]
*  an institutionalist, and he is obsessed with regular order. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=195.0s)]
*  I mean, he's really time and time again pushed back on people trying to cut corners. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=199.0s)]
*  Now, it's ironic here, Alito saying that's what you're doing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=205.0s)]
*  But I think the way that Chief Justice Roberts viewed this is that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=209.0s)]
*  this is getting out of control. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=212.0s)]
*  Let's go ahead and stop the action, give ourselves a chance to look at this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=214.0s)]
*  But I think that Roberts is very likely looking for a way to give better navigational beacons, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=218.0s)]
*  to get everyone in a little more controlled state. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=223.0s)]
*  These district court judges have been issuing these national injunctions, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=227.0s)]
*  despite years of the majority of the Supreme Court saying stop doing this, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=232.0s)]
*  including Roberts, and they have not listened. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=238.0s)]
*  So I think that the court is going to be establishing more stronger rules [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=241.0s)]
*  to govern these lower courts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82-__tvs8yg&t=247.0s)]
