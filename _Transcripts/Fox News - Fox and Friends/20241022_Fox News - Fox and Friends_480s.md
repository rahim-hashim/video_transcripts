# Trump goes to NYC barber shop, touts RFK Jr's plan to combat 'artificial foods'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M)
*  What is the plan to do about the fast, the food health care industry and getting the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=0.0s)]
*  artificial foods banned in our urban communities that have less access to organic whole foods? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=5.68s)]
*  So Bobby Kennedy, right? Everybody likes Bobby. And he's so big into the health food and women, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=13.6s)]
*  things, everything. He wants to do things in the environment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=20.0s)]
*  And he endorsed me. First time a Kennedy's ever endorsed a Republican. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's going to be the last, but I doubt it. And he's a great guy. He would be so perfect. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=27.52s)]
*  He doesn't like artificial foods and he doesn't like pesticides and all the stuff they put on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=32.72s)]
*  them. And if you listen to him for 10 minutes, I mean, he says other countries that don't do [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  anything are healthier than us. Okay. We're not that healthy, to put it mildly. So no artificial [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=41.04s)]
*  foods. We don't want artificial. We have plenty of food. The food isn't our problem. And our [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=47.36s)]
*  farmers are great. And our farmers aren't allowed to do their job. You know, our farmers did great [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=51.84s)]
*  four years ago. They were doing just about the best they've ever done. They're not doing well [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=57.04s)]
*  at all now. We're not going to have artificial foods. We don't want artificial foods. We want [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  healthy foods and a lot of things are going to be going. And I'll tell you, I'm going to have Bobby [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=64.88s)]
*  Kennedy involved in it. He's great guy. And even the way when I mentioned his name, all you guys, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=68.72s)]
*  and you're tough cookies, you know, you wouldn't think sometimes you'd say, maybe you wouldn't like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=73.28s)]
*  a guy like Bobby, but he, he's a person that talks more about food and health than anything else. So [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=77.6s)]
*  I think that's cool. So we'll get it. We'll get it taken care of. You'll be healthier in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=84.64s)]
*  four years from now than you are now. And you look very healthy to me, by the way. Thank you. Go [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=89.6s)]
*  ahead. What do you have for me? Mr. Trump. My biggest concern is the future and the future [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=95.12s)]
*  generation, my kids' generation. Yeah. A lot of people are worried that attaining the American [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=100.64s)]
*  dream at this point in time and in the near future is going to be unattainable for this upcoming [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  generation, which I have kids that are part of that generation. How many kids you have? I have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=109.04s)]
*  two, a 17 and an 18 year old. Okay. Now the big, I believe one of the biggest hurdles we have when [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=114.32s)]
*  it comes to attaining that American dream is over taxation. Yeah. When it comes to federal taxes, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  I know you, we're going to bring back, I'm sure you're going to start back up the pipeline, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=129.12s)]
*  the Keystone pipeline, which is going to generate an abundance of revenue. Also with the tariffs [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  that you've spoken of. So my question is with all this extra revenue we're going to be bringing into [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=139.44s)]
*  the country. So do you believe at some point in time we could find a way once the country's back [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=144.08s)]
*  on its feet and getting enough revenue and paid off our debt? Do you think it's possible to find [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=148.8s)]
*  a way to eliminate federal taxes for? There is a way. There is a way. How do you feel about it? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=153.12s)]
*  You know, in the old days, when we were smart, when we were a smart country in the 1890s and all, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=157.68s)]
*  this is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was. It had all tariffs. It didn't have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=163.12s)]
*  an income tax. Yes, sir. Okay. Now we have income taxes and we have people that are dying. They're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  paying tax and they don't have the money to pay the tax. No, in the old days, 1890, 1880, we had [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=173.12s)]
*  so much money. They had to set up committees, blue ribbon committees, how to spend our wealth. We had [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  no idea how to spend it with so much money. Then we went to the income tax system and the rest is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=185.84s)]
*  sort of history. But no, there is a way. I mean, if we, if what I'm planning comes out, it's a great [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  question, by the way. You're a pretty sophisticated cat, you know. Everyone could attain the American [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=196.96s)]
*  dream if it wasn't for the high cost, the burden of high taxes. And we tax it every step of the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=202.72s)]
*  way. Yeah. When we make it, when we spend it. And regulations. And regulations. So I cut more [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=208.48s)]
*  regulations in four years than any other president by four times. Yeah, let's go. You would ask one [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=213.44s)]
*  question. What is one thing that you probably feel like you didn't do in your first term that you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=218.16s)]
*  feel like you could do better now? I'll tell you the one thing, because I did, you know, look, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=223.36s)]
*  we had the best economy with the best border. We had a lot of, so I did a lot of good stuff. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=227.04s)]
*  Rebuilt the military. It's all about people. I got to get the right people. You know, when I went [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=230.96s)]
*  there, I won 92% of the presidents, 92% for the whole history of our country were politicians. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=236.56s)]
*  8% were generals, no admirals. 8% which is it. That's 100%. 92 and eight. They were politicians [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=244.4s)]
*  and they were generals. General Washington, you know, et cetera, et cetera. George Washington. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=252.32s)]
*  Thank you. You're doing very good at that. I'm just going to sign this. I got longer arms. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=256.48s)]
*  Yeah, you do have longer arms. So they were so here's what we do. We take all of that and we come [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=261.76s)]
*  and here comes Donald Trump down the line. And so it's about people. It's all about people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=270.56s)]
*  I went to Washington 17 times in my entire life. So I wasn't a Washington person. I was a New York [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=276.88s)]
*  person. So when I went to Washington, all of a sudden I'm standing in the White House opposite [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=283.12s)]
*  the Lincoln bedroom and I said, man, this is so amazing, but I didn't really know too many. So I [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=286.88s)]
*  had to rely on people to give me recommendations for people to run agencies, to be secretary of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=292.08s)]
*  this secretary of that, all big stuff. And I didn't know anybody. I had to rely and I still did great. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=297.76s)]
*  Look, we rebuilt the military. We docked out ISIS. We did all these things. We did great. We had the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=303.68s)]
*  best economy. We had the best everything. Everything was good, but I had some people that if I had it to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=307.92s)]
*  do again, I wouldn't have used. Now I've been there four years plus another four that I'm sort [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDRFsj2i38M&t=312.64s)]
