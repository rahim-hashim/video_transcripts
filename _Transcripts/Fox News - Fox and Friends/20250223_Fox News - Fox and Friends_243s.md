# HAMAS' DAYS 'ARE NUMBERED': Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU)
*  We have a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel delaying the release of 620 Palestinian terrorists [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  until Hamas agrees to stop humiliating [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=5.96s)]
*  spectacles for innocent Israeli hostages being released. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=8.88s)]
*  Yesterday, in a final act of cruelty, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=13.08s)]
*  Hamas forced two Israeli captives [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=15.68s)]
*  to watch their fellow hostages being released [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=17.6s)]
*  before returning them to tunnels. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  George Birnbaum served as chief of staff [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=23.76s)]
*  to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=25.6s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=27.88s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=28.68s)]
*  So it's kind of mind blowing as a spectator to all of this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=30.64s)]
*  If a civilized country, even if Russia [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=35.92s)]
*  were to do something like this, the gates of hell would open. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=39.56s)]
*  The UN would condemn them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=43.2s)]
*  And the world would put an end to it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  But for some reason, that doesn't seem to happen here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=48.28s)]
*  Well, Israel and the Jewish people [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  have always been treated a little bit differently [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  than everyone else. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=55.68s)]
*  History pans that out. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=57.08s)]
*  And it's no surprise that even now it's happening. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=59.16s)]
*  I will say, Charlie, that you know [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  it's really bad when even the High Commissioner for the UN [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Committee on Human Rights, Volker Turk, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  puts out a statement condemning what [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=69.28s)]
*  Hamas did with the coffins of the Bebas family [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  and the other Israeli hostages slain in captivity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=73.88s)]
*  What they have done, both of the living hostages [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=77.4s)]
*  and dead hostages, is appalling and just [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=79.68s)]
*  speaks to the depravity of Hamas and their ideology. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=82.6s)]
*  And of course, I also want your viewers to remember [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=85.84s)]
*  that these ceremonies are taking place in front of thousands [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  upon thousands of what most of the world [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  likes to call innocent Gazan civilians. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=93.68s)]
*  They're cheering, they're applauding, they're clapping. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  These are not innocent civilians. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  These are people who are cheering terrorists. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=101.36s)]
*  And these are people who are cheering [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=103.28s)]
*  the depraved acts of terrorists and the way they treat [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=105.0s)]
*  living and dead hostages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  So I think you bring up a really important point here, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  because civilized humans look at this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=112.4s)]
*  and they think it's such a terrible spectacle [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=115.6s)]
*  that makes Hamas look so bad. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  So you kind of ask yourself, well, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  what are they doing this for? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=122.64s)]
*  What's the propaganda value when all civilized humans [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=123.96s)]
*  around the world who are watching this see it as disgusting? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  What is the purpose of their doing? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=131.16s)]
*  And I think you just touched on it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=132.56s)]
*  They are trying desperately to hold onto power [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=135.12s)]
*  and exert an image that they are still in control. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=137.68s)]
*  Their days have been numbered ever since October 7th, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=140.6s)]
*  and they will be numbered until every single last one [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=143.56s)]
*  of them is eliminated from the face of the earth. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=146.08s)]
*  Israel will not rest even after every hostage is released [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=147.8s)]
*  and every body is returned until these murderous terrorists [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=151.04s)]
*  are eliminated from the face of the earth. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  But they are desperately trying to cling onto power in Gaza [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=156.68s)]
*  and show the people of Gaza, as well as their allies [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=159.4s)]
*  in Lebanon and most of all in Iran, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=162.6s)]
*  that they are still in power. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=165.2s)]
*  So for a lot of us watching, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=166.96s)]
*  I thought that the bombing campaign for the past year [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=168.72s)]
*  and a half was going to put an end to the Hamas rule. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=172.42s)]
*  Clearly it has not. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=175.9s)]
*  You seem to be confident that these are their last days. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=177.28s)]
*  Why are you confident of that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=180.74s)]
*  For one, Israel now has a new ally in the White House [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=184.06s)]
*  and Donald Trump that has given the full support [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  to the prime minister and the Israeli people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=188.82s)]
*  that whatever Israel needs to do to wipe out these terrorists, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=191.06s)]
*  they have the backing of the White House [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=194.3s)]
*  and of the American people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=196.22s)]
*  That goes a long way. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=197.94s)]
*  And that means that this is not a short game. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=199.18s)]
*  This is a long game. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=200.94s)]
*  And if you'll remember, Charlie, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=201.78s)]
*  even after the Munich massacres in 1972 at the Olympics, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=203.18s)]
*  many of those terrorists thought they were safe [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=207.38s)]
*  for years after the end of the massacre in 1972. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=209.26s)]
*  And Israel stayed the course and took them out eventually. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=212.94s)]
*  So whether or not this is a matter of days or weeks [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=216.1s)]
*  or months or even years, it's unclear, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=218.22s)]
*  but they will be eliminated [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=220.62s)]
*  and they will no longer walk the face of this earth [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=222.3s)]
*  at some point. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=225.26s)]
*  Well, I hope you're correct. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=226.54s)]
*  George Birnbaum, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=228.34s)]
*  Thank you so much. Have a good morning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GMCLy_E5BU&t=230.7s)]
