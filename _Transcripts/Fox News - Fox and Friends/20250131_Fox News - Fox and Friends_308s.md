# NYC residents 'terrified' of new migrant shelter: 'I will have to move'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ)
*  So, in New York City, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  ICE raids have taken dozens of illegal migrants into custody, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=1.46s)]
*  included suspected gang members and accused killers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=5.16s)]
*  You had a massive migrant shelter that would house 2,000 men, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=7.96s)]
*  it's still slated to open in NYC next month. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  Angry residents, they're speaking out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=15.5s)]
*  I had never been afraid of the South Bronx. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=18.88s)]
*  I am now terrified. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  I'm terrified for me, for my students. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=23.88s)]
*  I will have to move. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  As literally someone that has lived this experience personally, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  you should be ashamed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=34.32s)]
*  It is not okay for you to take our tax money. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Ken Janello is the ICE Acting Deputy Director, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=39.98s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=43.28s)]
*  Ken, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  I know you don't know much about the shelter, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=47.3s)]
*  but I do know that there's a lot of criminal aliens [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=49.9s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=53.44s)]
*  How is this going to make it difficult [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=55.2s)]
*  with New York being a sanctuary city for your job? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=57.26s)]
*  Well, obviously, I've been speaking about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=60.7s)]
*  sanctuary city policies for a long time now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=62.58s)]
*  You see all the great work that the men and women of ICE [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=65.98s)]
*  have been doing in this administration. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=68.7s)]
*  The problem is, is the sanctuary policies, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  basically, there's no cooperation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=75.54s)]
*  with local law enforcement. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=77.72s)]
*  So, NYPD, unfortunately, can't cooperate with us [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=78.92s)]
*  on our administrative issues. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=82.62s)]
*  We have administrative immigration cases. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=84.78s)]
*  So, when we had a unit that was based at a Rikers Island [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=88.08s)]
*  during the former May de Blasio time, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=91.3s)]
*  when they strengthened the sanctuary policies, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=95.36s)]
*  they kicked the unit out of Rikers Island, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=98.56s)]
*  which basically meant that those people that we would vet [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=100.54s)]
*  that were foreign-born aliens at the time, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=104.5s)]
*  that we determined to be amenable to removal proceedings, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=108.04s)]
*  we were taken to custody. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  On an average, at that time, over 10 years ago, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=112.3s)]
*  we were taken about 100 a month. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  So, if you do the math, that's 100 a month. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=118.4s)]
*  You're talking about 1,000 to 1,200 individuals [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=120.48s)]
*  that are now being released right back into the community. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=123.5s)]
*  So, just so the audience understands, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=125.2s)]
*  so when there's a detainer put on a person, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  typically, if it's not a sanctuary city, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=129.84s)]
*  you've got a criminal alien that's in the jail. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=132.68s)]
*  You just want to come and pick them up. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=135.08s)]
*  As a result of the sanctuary city, you can't do that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  So, these people are back out in the public, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=139.56s)]
*  and now you've got to send a task force [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=142.06s)]
*  to go after these people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  So, basically, someone gets arrested [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  and charged with a crime. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=148.36s)]
*  They go remanded to custody of Rikers, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=149.9s)]
*  and then we lodge an immigration detainer, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  which is also accompanied by an immigration warrant. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=155.94s)]
*  And due to the sanctuary policies, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  they will not accept the immigration detainer, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=161.62s)]
*  nor the administrative warrant. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=163.86s)]
*  So, they just release the criminals [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=165.88s)]
*  right back into the community to re-offend, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=168.6s)]
*  and there's a lot of recidivism with these individuals. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=171.36s)]
*  So, let's just talk about New York City [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=173.6s)]
*  so the audience can see a picture. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=175.2s)]
*  We're talking about, I think the last number I heard, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=176.7s)]
*  around 60,000 criminal migrants in the city. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=178.78s)]
*  That does not include the Gadawais, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=182.94s)]
*  and we're not just talking about 60,000 people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=184.52s)]
*  that are illegally in the country, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=187.18s)]
*  but they have committed a crime, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=188.38s)]
*  That's correct. I remember quoting some numbers [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=191.02s)]
*  a couple of months ago that it was around that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=193.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, it does not include the Gadawais. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=197.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=200.12s)]
*  So, like you said, when they release these individuals [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=201.06s)]
*  back into the community, as you've seen over the past week, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=203.6s)]
*  the amount of force that's needed to go out and arrest them, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=207.9s)]
*  because obviously a lot of... [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=211.94s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=212.9s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of these people are bad actors. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=214.08s)]
*  They're violent felons, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=215.8s)]
*  and they have the upper hand in their apartments or residences. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=218.34s)]
*  So, when you're going in, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=221.44s)]
*  you need to ensure you have safety in the show of force. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=223.16s)]
*  And sanctuary policies also drain taxpayers' money, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  because now we have to send all these resources out [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  to try and arrest these individuals [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=233.58s)]
*  that we could have just taken in the confines [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=235.88s)]
*  and the security of a facility or a jail. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  Real quickly, I only got about 15 seconds, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=242.82s)]
*  but there's rumors going out there [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  that ICE is arresting American citizens, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=247.3s)]
*  Can you just dispel that? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=251.66s)]
*  There's a difference from an American citizen [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  that is detained when they're around another criminal migrant, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  but they're not deporting or arresting American citizens, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=263.1s)]
*  Obviously, there's some misinformation [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=264.06s)]
*  and false narratives that are getting played in the media, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=266.2s)]
*  which unfortunately always seems to accompany our agency, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=269.36s)]
*  but ICE does not arrest U.S. citizens [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=272.64s)]
*  unless they have a specific criminal warrant [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=275.5s)]
*  for a U.S. citizen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=278.22s)]
*  But on an immigration enforcement, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=279.24s)]
*  for the civil immigration cases, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=281.44s)]
*  we do not arrest U.S. citizens. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=283.94s)]
*  We focus on criminal aliens [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  and those that present a danger to national security. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=288.76s)]
*  Sir, thank you for all that you do. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=292.12s)]
*  Your men and women are doing a great job out there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=293.66s)]
*  I want them to stay safe. Thank you, sir. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyf6nijtEOQ&t=295.8s)]
