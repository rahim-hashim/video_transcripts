# 'STOP ESCALATING THE THREAT ENVIRONMENT': Lawmakers urge Harris to halt anti-Trump rhetoric
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU)
*  Speaker Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are saying this is exactly the kind of rhetoric that's gonna get him shot again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=0.0s)]
*  Watch this is it's it's a statement. I'm sorry. I'm sorry [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=8.4s)]
*  I'm sorry vice president Harris may want the American people to entrust her with the sacred duty of executive authority [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=11.52s)]
*  But first she must abandon the base and irresponsible rhetoric that endangers both American lives and institutions [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=16.8s)]
*  We have both been briefed on the ongoing persistent threats to the former president [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump by adversaries to the United States and we call on the vice president to take these threats seriously [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=27.48s)]
*  Stop escalating the threat environment and help ensure that president Trump has the necessary resources to be protected [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=33.2s)]
*  From those threats a lot of people worried about his life good for them for saying that they should have said it on camera though [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  Imagine correct imagine if there were two assassination attempts on Kamala Harris yet [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=47.96s)]
*  Republicans continued the way Democrats are man. They actually talked about that on Rogan Trump and in Rogan discussed imagine one [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=53.36s)]
*  assassination attempt on Joe Biden one [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=61.72s)]
*  Okay on or on Kamala [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  The news would be insane. It would be absolutely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=67.2s)]
*  It wouldn't be washed away in a matter of in the second assassination attempt. Did it even go a week? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=70.92s)]
*  I mean it would be used to smear every single mega [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=76.76s)]
*  Absolutely [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=81.32s)]
*  For years it would have been an excuse to round up people go through their social media do all the stuff [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=83.32s)]
*  They do be insane set and he said to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=88.96s)]
*  Two attempts on his life and the rhetoric has only ratcheted up [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  I think that um, you know, I think I don't know if I spoke to you guys you can go back [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=96.02s)]
*  I remember you remember we all remember George W. Bush was called Hitler like literally he was called Hitler [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=101.02s)]
*  Trump's now called Hitler you can go back to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=106.8s)]
*  1948 where Harry Truman called Thomas Dewey Democrat Harry Truman called Republican Thomas Dewey candidate for president [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=110.24s)]
*  Hitler fascist bigot all of these tricks are [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=117.08s)]
*  Like it's nothing new. It's yeah, it's the same tool over and over again. It's ratcheted incredibly high [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=121.88s)]
*  Where do they think it's their play right? They did it as a one-off they did to Barry Goldwater [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=129.4s)]
*  They did it to Ronald. We do this segment at Fox of it. They did it to take [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=133.36s)]
*  Gerald Ford they did it to to Ronald Reagan, of course George W [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=136.92s)]
*  Bush to your point Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan they did it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=140.76s)]
*  Yeah, so they've is always in their playbook but with Trump its repetition. It's it's not a one-off. It's their slogan [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=143.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's a fascist. He's a dictator. He he wants to be the next Hitler dictator on day [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=151.04s)]
*  It's all they're saying and it is actually really really dangerous and they're taking him so out of context [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=156.88s)]
*  Remember he said I'm gonna be a dictator on day one when I do all these executive orders [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=162.92s)]
*  It was all said in jest if you watch the clip it was obvious, but they keep using that by the way [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris was asked to respond to that letter by speaker Johnson and leader McConnell and here's what she said [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=172.48s)]
*  Well, listen [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=180.64s)]
*  We all must speak out against any form of political violence and I'm very clear about that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  No one should be the subject of violence much less political violence [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  but the American people deserve to be presented with facts and the truth and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=192.11999999999998s)]
*  The fact and the truth is that some of the people closest to Donald Trump when he was president [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=197.16s)]
*  Generals including most recently John Kelly a four-star Marine general [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=204.11999999999998s)]
*  Have been very clear about the danger and the threat that Donald Trump poses to America and the fact that he is unfit [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=209.92s)]
*  To serve and the American people deserve to hear that and know about that a lot of words [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  But let me sum it up other I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep doing this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and other people are gonna do it for me, too [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=226.36s)]
*  By the way, they didn't do this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  You remember this was Joe Biden's line of attack threat to democracy threat to democracy when Kamala came in it went away [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=230.72s)]
*  for basically most of the summer because [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=236.24s)]
*  Presumption for either because of assassination attempts or it wasn't working or they were joy [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=239.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was and now as we've come all the way around to the homestretch it's their closing argument [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=244.92s)]
*  They were back to where Joe was yeah, clearly their internals and their focus groups told them [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=249.96s)]
*  That's the message that will work the most because you can't run on your record [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=253.76s)]
*  They can't run on their record and she's confused about whether she's with the record or without the record [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=257.52s)]
*  So it's devolving back to it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=261.04s)]
*  And that's an old TV trick by the way that she just pulled in TV if you want to say something [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=262.44s)]
*  But you don't want to say it you run a soundbite if someone else saying it and that's you saying it [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=266.32s)]
*  Yeah, she doesn't want she's like I want to say that he's a threat [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=270.2s)]
*  I'm not gonna say it so I'm gonna say what John Kelly said they said and say that therefore I can then say he's a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=273.04s)]
*  Threat because John Kelly said it and that's their rationalization to keep saying this kind of stuff. I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwd42VLzCU&t=278.84000000000003s)]
