# Inside Kamala Harris' 'tricky' policies
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0)
*  Let's bring in Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream who joins us now. Good morning, Shannon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey guys [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=5.04s)]
*  I'm good to see you and I love that you're gonna do this off the wall because I think the tricky thing is is what? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=5.76s)]
*  Are the policies because we've heard some of them in the past that it seems like there's a bit of a disavowal now [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=10.76s)]
*  Not for the candidate herself, but statements were getting through campaign sources and those kinds of things like fracking. Yes. No [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=15.72s)]
*  Changing the Supreme Court. Yes. No, I mean there are all kinds of things so it'll be helpful [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=22.32s)]
*  So to follow up on that Shannon you're right [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=26.94s)]
*  It's fracking has been yes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=29.18s)]
*  No approach to crime has sort of been like hard on crime soft on crime at various points in her career and position [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  She's taken that's been yes. No [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  Curious one you highlight the Supreme Court [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=39.82s)]
*  Last I'd heard she was she was open and advocating for the idea of increasing aka [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  Packing the Supreme Court. Do we know is that also existing in the yes? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  Snowland we still don't know Kamala Harris and what she do to the Supreme Court [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=52.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's fair to say because apparently back in 2019 during campaigning [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=55.82s)]
*  She talked about having a conversation being opening to adding seats then both she and President Biden during the administration [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=59.6s)]
*  We're like no. No, I don't think that's the best way to go [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=65.64s)]
*  well now, you know that the president has proposed a new set of potential changes for the Supreme Court and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=67.82s)]
*  She's apparently signed on to that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=73.42s)]
*  So it's just one of the many areas that we don't know exactly what her intentions are and that's why important that you know [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=75.02s)]
*  She gets out there there are so many pieces out there and it's not just you know [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  Those that you would think or center-right media, you know papers and those kinds of things [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=84.22s)]
*  I mean it's all over the media landscape now where we're starting starting to see some of the mainstream media say hey [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=88.18s)]
*  We have questions that we need to get answered. So I'm well [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=94.06s)]
*  I'm still waiting to see someone other than Shannon Bream asking those questions [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=97.06s)]
*  Maybe they could ask her about this because it wasn't very long ago [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=101.78s)]
*  We talked a little bit about how how now she says she doesn't want to put taxes on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=104.86s)]
*  People's tips, but it was very [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=109.82s)]
*  during this administration [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=112.38s)]
*  That they said they were going to actually charge the IRS all the new IRS agents that they just brought on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=113.9s)]
*  to go after people's tips and in fact uber anybody like uber drivers who has a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=120.34s)]
*  You know where it's actually [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=126.66s)]
*  Calculated and and you can prove that they got the tip because it's it's digital was very upset about it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=128.78s)]
*  How's she gonna walk that back? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=134.3s)]
*  I do think it's really interesting that she has now talked about this on the campaign trail out west in places [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=135.3s)]
*  You know like Nevada and other places, Arizona where there's a very heavy hospitality industry and it's a popular line [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=141.22s)]
*  But it's the exact same line that President Trump started months ago and the policy position he had months ago [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=146.94s)]
*  It's so for a ticket that's gonna say Trump's ideas are all bad [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=152.82000000000002s)]
*  They're bad for the economy and everything else just interesting that she would take something that's been such a high-profile [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=156.06s)]
*  Talking point from him and pick it up on the campaign trail, but she says the economic plan is coming this week [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=160.82s)]
*  There's nothing on the website the campaign website about that. So it's gonna be helpful. We need that data as you guys said [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=165.62s)]
*  I mean voting is starting within a matter of weeks and we're still very much on the media honeymoon [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  So you got to wonder whether any of that correction is gonna happen before we actually get to the votes that matter [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=176.66s)]
*  Well, meanwhile our our government, I don't know a guest may be on autopilot [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=182.82s)]
*  We don't we're not quite sure what Joe is doing on a regular basis [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=186.86s)]
*  We do have new images yesterday of him [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=189.86s)]
*  Sleeping on the beach in Rehovot certainly not in campaign mode anymore [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  But he did take a moment to do an interview with another network and he talked about his decision to drop out of the race [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=197.74s)]
*  It's the first time we've heard from him directly about it. Here's what he said Shannon [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  When I ran the first time I thought of myself as being in transition prison I [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=210.22000000000003s)]
*  Can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get out of my mouth [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=215.58s)]
*  Oh [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=218.78s)]
*  It's a great honor being president [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=219.94s)]
*  I think I'm an obligation to the country to do what I the most important thing you can do and that is we must [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=221.78s)]
*  We must we must defeat Trump [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=228.22s)]
*  so [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=231.54s)]
*  Shannon, what do you make of what does the rest of his term look like? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=232.74s)]
*  Well, first of all, he's got one more interview in the column than the current vice president [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=237.58s)]
*  Since he stepped down he said more interviews than she has it's only one but we're waiting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=243.34s)]
*  I think that you guys know we've talked about this all over the channel and beyond about what happens when you're a lame duck president [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=248.18s)]
*  Because we see provocations again, you know [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=254.74s)]
*  The Pentagon says it was an Iranian proxy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  They came after our service members five people including a contractor as well injured at the Al-Assad base [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=260.66s)]
*  We're gonna talk about that on the show this morning the fact that there have been, you know [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=266.3s)]
*  175 attacks since October so [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  You know, there are those who do not feel very worried about a Biden-Harris administration [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=272.7s)]
*  You got to wonder how they feel now about Harris waltz administration [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=277.52s)]
*  But he's talked about doing all kinds of big things before the end of his term [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=279.94s)]
*  Does not seem like there's gonna be the will on Capitol Hill to get any of that done [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  So maybe the most productive place for him is to you know, get some rest [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=287.78s)]
*  what else is coming up this morning on Fox News Sunday, so we're gonna talk with Senator Tom Cotton and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  Congressman Jason Crow, so we've got a D and an R represented both veterans [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=296.82s)]
*  So we're gonna talk a lot of foreign policy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=300.46s)]
*  But also what you know trying to figure out the positions of this new Harris waltz ticket and where we go from there [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=301.9s)]
*  We've also got two economists with us this morning to break down what's happening in the markets [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=307.48s)]
*  Where those policies and changes but you know proposed by the two campaigns will impact your 401k and everything else your groceries [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=311.62s)]
*  And gas and all that moving forward. All right, Shannon will be watching. Thank you so much [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  By the way, can I say will I'm very impressed that you're actually injured by something that you did as impressive as that swim [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  Where I'm getting to the point where like wake up in the morning and I've somehow injured my neck and back by sleeping on the wrong [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=329.58s)]

*  I probably didn't factor in this could be age-related as well [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mzg8baPK0&t=341.06s)]
