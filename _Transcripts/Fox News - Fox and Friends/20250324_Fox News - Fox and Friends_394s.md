**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw)
*  Let's talk about one of the most disturbing things to happen in this climate since Donald Trump took office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=0.0s)]
*  And that is the targeting Tesla over the weekend the anti Tesla protests were in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=4.8s)]
*  13 different locations from West Palm Beach to Chesterfield, Missouri, New York City, Milford, Connecticut [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=11.16s)]
*  Mechanicsville, Pennsylvania big and small cities all sitting there [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=17.16s)]
*  Protesting Tesla in their dealerships the leading electric car company because it happens to be [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=21.0s)]
*  Engineered by Elon Musk who hate to tell you only ends 15% of the country, but don't let of the company [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=26.68s)]
*  But don't let that slow you down. So they have three goals [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=32.64s)]
*  Rachel sell your Tesla's dump your stop join the picket lines [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=36.08s)]
*  We're taking Tesla stock prices to stop Musk and then the third one is stopping must will help save lives and protect our democracy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=39.68s)]
*  Yeah, right. Yeah, so I'm gonna translate that lot last one stopping must will help save lives and protect democracy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=46.8s)]
*  Translate that from liberal speak [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=52.96s)]
*  It means we're really mad that you took apart USAID and all the money laundering that we were doing through there to get to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=54.4s)]
*  To give to George Soros who then gave money to us. It was like a big old scheme and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=62.32s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump blew that up and boy are they mad that they don't have access to our money to fund their radical [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=66.96s)]
*  Agenda anymore. And so now there I don't know where they're getting the money. Donald Trump said look at those signs. They're nice [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=74.96s)]
*  They're expensive somebody is funding this we need to get to the bottom of who is Astro turfing this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=80.12s)]
*  So if you get caught you get five to ten years, so you say how would you like nine you had nine? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=85.76s)]
*  You tell me who's funding this? I'm sure on discreetly. These aren't hardened criminals like those cartel members [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=90.1s)]
*  They will start telling you exactly who's clear who's direct depositing into their account [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=96.0s)]
*  I'm worried about the 29th because we had failed actor John Cusack [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=100.38s)]
*  He was late he peaked in 18 1983 sitting there calling for a day of pain and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=105.56s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett saying my birthday present will be the takedown of Elon Musk and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bonnie says you better watch it Crockett [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=117.52s)]
*  This is domestic terrorism and Maria now you have this Congresswoman [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=122.76s)]
*  Crockett who is calling for attacks on Elon Musk on her birthday. Let's take him out on my birthday [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=127.4s)]
*  She says yes, she turns and says oh, I'm not calling for violence [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=134.64s)]
*  Well, she is an elected public official and so she needs to tread very carefully because nothing will happen to Elon Musk [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=138.6s)]
*  I wasn't calling for violence and it's ridiculous that I even have to say something like that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=146.72s)]
*  But because they are trying to twist our words [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  One of the things that I told people to do is make sure you are adhering to the laws in your area [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=155.04s)]
*  I'm excited to see that Elon Musk [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=161.96s)]
*  That his money as it relates to Tesla well, Tesla's tanking right now and I'm okay with that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=164.72s)]
*  Twisting anything we play the sound but we let the audience decide [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=171.32s)]
*  That's me [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=174.8s)]
*  Well, this is the same people that was calling Elon Musk a Nazi when he was clearly putting his hand on his heart [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  So don't tell us that we're twisting anything [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=180.96s)]
*  And don't tell Americans who saw your summer of love and BLM and cities burning that you're not the party of political violence [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  It's just not it's just not credible and I give Elon Musk credit [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=191.08s)]
*  I hope it scared the hell out of Jamal Bowman because over the weekend over the choose [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=194.24s)]

*  Yeah, the other thing is and anyone who wonders about Elon's approach just understand. This is how he got successful [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=207.12s)]
*  He's about to roll out raw robots. They're gonna revolutionize senior care in our country [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Service in our country. They're gonna start working on the assembly lines over in with Tesla using some of the same technology [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=219.2s)]
*  And he's gonna get it down to 20-30 thousand dollars gonna do in nursing homes. Oh, well, they could provide senior care [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=225.76s)]

*  Human Rachel you have to see this video and this is what Elon Musk has got everyone's putting this out for $200,000 [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  He has pushed them to get it down to two twenty or thirty thousand dollars not affordable for most but affordable for some that'll go down [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=255.28s)]
*  He does that with everything Tesla car. Give me the best looking car possible. Let's have a solid state body. Let's save money [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=262.6s)]
*  Let's figure out make manufacturing simpler less less bolts and he comes out with an affordable car [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=269.52s)]
*  He's doing the same thing with robots and if you think that you by divesting of Tesla you're doing a good thing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=275.36s)]
*  You're actually hurting your wallet because this Tesla stock is down to right before the election [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=282.72s)]
*  And when he became when they won they thought he was gonna be next to power and his stock went through the roof [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=288.12s)]
*  Now it's suffering, but it's still strong. You are crazy to divest [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  I just don't like the whole comparison when it comes to they keep saying well Maggie did the same thing to Bud Light [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry Bud Light took a position [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=303.38s)]
*  Alright and Maggie wasn't setting things on fire that wasn't theirs [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  Bud Light as a company took a position Tesla has not taken a position Elon Musk the owner has taken a position [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=310.73999999999995s)]
*  But it's not Tesla changing their business model Tesla is the same Tesla. It's been forever. It's still focused on green energy [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=316.34s)]
*  They still manufacturing things but like change change the way that they were doing business and who they were marketing to and so the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=324.05999999999995s)]
*  Consumers decided that they weren't gonna buy the product because the product marketing change [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=331.42s)]
*  I don't think it's the same thing like let a Bud Light factory. No [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=336.1s)]
*  I don't believe they may have shot at their own but like cans, but you can do that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=340.3s)]
*  You could do that in your on your own property. Yeah, so you know what did by the way kid Rock met with the head of Budweiser [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=344.58000000000004s)]
*  They had it out. They said they talked about it. He goes. Okay, I get it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  I get it was just one marketing person that did it and he's they're fine now. They talked it out [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=353.18s)]
*  I have a sense of Crockett and Musk can't talk it out. Go ahead. I was just gonna say I don't believe in political violence [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=358.46s)]
*  But I'm very wary of transhumanism and replacing human touch in a nursing home with a robot [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=365.02s)]
*  Oh, I do know I put in for vacation and they said we don't have any anchors pool gonna have a robot [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zfFGeKBw&t=371.54s)]
