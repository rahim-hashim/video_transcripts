# Doocy: Harris once again has lost control of the news cycle
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8)
*  Now turning to senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey is in Las Vegas. Peter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning and we have a story about White House stenographers. First time this whole cycle. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=6.88s)]
*  The White House stenographers come with the House. They are not political. Some of them have been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=12.08s)]
*  there since Trump and will be there after Biden and they are now as mad as you will ever hear [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=16.16s)]
*  a stenographer on the record that White House officials working for President Biden tried to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  change the meaning of their transcript. So it sounded like the president on that Zoom with Voto [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=28.16s)]
*  Latino was just criticizing a comedian instead of all Trump supporters. So now we've got a supervisor [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=33.12s)]
*  from the stenographers office who is saying our stenography office transcript released to our [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=40.32s)]
*  distro which includes the National Archives is now different than the version edited and released [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=45.6s)]
*  to the public by press office staff and Amy Sands the director of that department continued. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=51.44s)]
*  Please avoid sharing rush drafts and excerpts which are subject to review and might create [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=57.6s)]
*  confusion among staff media and the public while our stenography office completes a thorough review [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=62.88s)]
*  process. The White House is not explaining what exactly happened here just to say the president [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  confirmed in his tweet on Tuesday evening that he was addressing the hateful rhetoric from the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=75.2s)]
*  comedian at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally that was reflected in the transcript and they're [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=80.32s)]
*  getting some help keeping MSG top of mind from JLo. At Madison Square Garden he reminded us who [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=86.64s)]
*  he really is and how he really feels. It wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=96.88s)]
*  okay it was every Latino in this country it was humanity and anyone of decent character. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=104.16s)]
*  The Harris campaign keeps losing control of news cycles because of this garbage comment and the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=111.6s)]
*  cleanup and White House staff apparently trying to change the meaning of something that everybody [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  who has watched the clip could hear with their own ears it is looking like this is becoming a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=125.2s)]
*  case a classic DC case of the cover-up being worse than the crime and the crime was pretty [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=129.68s)]
*  politically bad. Back to you. And Peter just to underline the fact that the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=135.52s)]
*  stenographers have been ever taken in the White House would you back that up? Do you have a second source? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=139.6s)]
*  Fox confirms the stenographers never hear him say anything they're always just sitting like two feet [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=144.88s)]
*  away from the president with a long microphone and a recorder and now they're going on the record [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=151.76s)]
*  and also the stenographer's office when the sonar has a leak right now we know about this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=157.84s)]
*  We're picturing a grandmother like angrier than she's ever been. They're probably just all in a line [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=163.84s)]
*  right they're probably all in a line there is a stenographer next to the stenographer with a mic [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=167.84s)]
*  to make sure that they got it right they'll all check their notes but this is a serious issue it is [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=173.36s)]
*  and we've all seen over the last couple years when it comes to White House staff giving stuff [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=178.24s)]
*  to the National Archives they want to have everything and they want to have the record [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=183.36s)]
*  right. The stenographers are there for a reason so the political appointees cannot come in and just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=188.96s)]
*  try to change the historical record and that is what they are very gently but publicly accusing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=201.52s)]
*  the White House of doing. Peter this is an exclusive you had to go to everybody heard the clip yeah we [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=209.12s)]
*  did you went to Las Vegas to tell us about the of the stenographer whistleblower case this is really [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D3bR_6jkr8&t=213.76s)]
