# Hispanic voter reveals when she became a 'walk away' from Democratic Party for Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U)
*  Rosa. Good morning. Good morning. You see that Donald Trump is closing that gap. Why [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=0.0s)]
*  do you think that's the case? And also give us a little background on your own history [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=4.76s)]
*  of political affiliation. Oh, yes. I'm a walk away and I became a walkaway when President [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=9.32s)]
*  Trump announced that he was going to go ahead and run for president back in 2015 for 2016. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=16.8s)]
*  Just like the majority of Hispanics down here in these areas in the border towns, we were [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=23.64s)]
*  raised to be Democrat and it was something that was generational. Nobody questioned it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=27.68s)]
*  The matriarch or patriarch stated that we were Democrats. We were all Democrats. No [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=33.04s)]
*  questions asked. But when President Trump announced and I saw the reaction in regards [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=37.28s)]
*  to his comments about the bad hombres as a former CBP officer, I knew exactly what President [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=41.6s)]
*  Trump was talking about. I knew that he was not referring to the majority of the people, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  but it was a big enough group that it was very concerning. So I was very appreciative [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=52.16s)]
*  of him bringing light to that issue. That was an issue that was passed over from administration [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=56.16s)]
*  administration. So even though he stepped on toes of both Republicans and Republicans [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  and Democrats, he was very blunt about it and he got attention which was needed and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=66.12s)]
*  he did something about it, which was secure. The border was the most secure, most secure [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=72.32s)]
*  at any point. Yeah, that's so interesting. He won you over on an issue that you really [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=77.0s)]
*  cared about. By the way, the Border Patrol is a majority Hispanic law enforcement group. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=81.5s)]
*  So the majority of our Border Patrol are Hispanics. Let's go to Sammy. Sammy, Rosa comes from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=86.7s)]
*  the Southwest, a lot of Mexican Americans there. You're Dominican from an urban area [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=92.62s)]
*  here in New York City. Talk to me about why you're interested in voting for Donald Trump [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=97.58s)]
*  and also as Rosa did, your own political background. Like were you always a Republican or were [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=102.18s)]
*  you a Democrat before? Well, like Rosa, I left the Democratic Party just recently and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=107.98s)]
*  as a matter of fact, we started the newly Dominican American Republican Club because [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=115.3s)]
*  like Latinos, just like every other group, we do not like the immigration policies, law [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  and order, inflation. We have endless wars and we have a gender ideology that they're [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  pushing down our throats. We don't like it and we want to end that. We want to keep men [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=132.7s)]
*  out of sports just like any other group. Sammy, Rosa, so great getting your opinions right [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=136.54s)]
*  after the former commander and former president, Donald Trump. And I think you guys represent [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  I think what we're seeing in the polls, this trend towards the Republicans being very issue [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=147.98s)]
*  based. And that's really interesting to hear from both of you. Thank you for joining us [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=154.26s)]
*  today. Thank you. Thank you. You got it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEm3OqpM_U&t=158.54s)]
