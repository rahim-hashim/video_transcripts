# Lawrence Jones: If this happens, 'the election is over'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU)
*  The Barber Shop is the center of everything in the community. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=0.0s)]
*  If you want to know something, politics, what's happening in the streets, any type of deals, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=5.8s)]
*  anything, you come to the Barber Shop. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=10.8s)]
*  The DNC is here in Chicago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=13.08s)]
*  How do y'all feel about that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=16.44s)]
*  It's a really interesting discussion. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=18.84s)]
*  We're going to find out, you know, after this convention, how the American people feel about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=20.88s)]
*  their pocketbooks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=25.32s)]
*  Tell me about the people that come and sit in your chair. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=26.64s)]
*  What do they say is, what's normally the number one issue they feel is facing the country right now? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=28.6s)]
*  Finance. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=34.0s)]
*  Finances? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=37.0s)]
*  Support. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=38.0s)]
*  The cost of living is high. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=39.0s)]
*  They tell me that they just, they want to see a change in inflation, prices. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  I think taxes are too high. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=46.6s)]
*  Groceries are too high. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=48.0s)]
*  Taxes are too high. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=49.2s)]
*  Gas is too high. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=50.2s)]
*  It's just too high. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=51.2s)]
*  All the immigrants came in and they give them the stuff they had for the Americans, they [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=52.8s)]
*  give them to the immigrants to cover their work. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=58.8s)]
*  It hurts black people more than any. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=62.0s)]
*  Black men particularly like to work with their hands. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=63.8s)]
*  They like to drive trucks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=67.2s)]
*  You know, those are jobs that, you know, an illegal can come in and underbid him with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  third world prices and put him out of work. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=74.4s)]
*  Who do you think is responsible for them, giving them the benefits and allowing them [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=76.8s)]
*  to come over? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=80.8s)]
*  Biden. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=82.0s)]
*  Trump was trying to keep him out, so to speak, as much as he could, but Biden just like let [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=83.0s)]
*  the gate open. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=94.0s)]
*  Who would win from the people that you speak to? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=95.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=97.6s)]
*  50-50. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=99.6s)]
*  It's still a 50-50 race. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=100.6s)]
*  It's up in the air. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=102.6s)]
*  Some people like Kamala because she represents change and she's different. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=103.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=106.6s)]
*  Some people like Trump because they feel like he's more business-minded. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=107.6s)]
*  So it's just up in the air. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=110.6s)]
*  It's a coin flip. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=111.6s)]
*  They're going to vote for Kamala. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=112.6s)]
*  And why do you think they're going to vote for Kamala? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=113.6s)]
*  Because they made it about history now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=116.6s)]
*  I'm going to vote for Kamala. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=118.6s)]
*  So when you were telling me about the number one issue, talking about illegal immigration [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=119.6s)]
*  and them coming to Chicago, she represents the same thing as Biden. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=123.6s)]
*  You said Trump fixed it, was trying to fix it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=128.6s)]
*  So why don't you double down and vote for Kamala? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=131.6s)]
*  The reason I would let her sit and vote for her is because I think it's time for a woman [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=135.6s)]
*  president. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=141.6s)]
*  What do you say to the brothers that say, I'm just trying to, life was just better for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=142.6s)]
*  me under the last administration? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=147.6s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=149.6s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=150.6s)]
*  Especially people in our industry. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=151.6s)]
*  But you do hear it, don't you? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=152.6s)]
*  I hear it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=154.6s)]
*  I hear it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=155.6s)]
*  But I don't believe it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=156.6s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=157.6s)]
*  It's really enlightening to hear individuals start to change their political direction. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=158.6s)]
*  I think it's time that blacks in general need to boost our political IQ. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=163.6s)]
*  Stop being blindly faithful to a one party system that doesn't work for us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=169.6s)]
*  Growing up, you know, you choose to be like a Democrat, you know, but they really don't [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=175.6s)]
*  know the history of it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=180.6s)]
*  It's time to start thinking about like, thinking outside the box. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=181.6s)]
*  Basically, most of us, I believe we voted Democrat because that's what we were brought [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=185.6s)]
*  up to do. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=190.6s)]
*  You know, you go to the polls, they say vote Democrat, vote Democrat. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=191.6s)]
*  But I don't really see no change that they say they've been doing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=194.6s)]
*  Everything you're hearing from the Democrats are already things that they failed at over [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=198.6s)]
*  30 years. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=203.6s)]
*  Blacks are struggling more than any other Democrat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=204.6s)]
*  We got the highest prison rate, highest high school dropout rate, highest murder rate. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=207.6s)]
*  What's in it for us? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=212.6s)]
*  Most blacks are conservative. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=213.6s)]
*  If the Republican Party could just learn how to communicate. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=215.6s)]
*  And the reason why they can't communicate is they can't, they don't get us. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=219.6s)]
*  But a lot of people are waking up right now, as you can see, speaking to the brothers and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=224.6s)]
*  sisters in this shop. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=228.6s)]
*  And you know how many barber shops and beauty salons are out throughout the country? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=229.6s)]
*  This same conversation is happening pretty much in every barber shop. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=233.6s)]
*  Everywhere, man, and it's changing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=236.6s)]
*  That's great, Lawrence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=239.6s)]
*  Let me tell you, it was like being back at home. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=241.6s)]
*  And I credit the barber shop with making me someone that could do TV because you debate [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=243.6s)]
*  you got to defend your issues. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=248.6s)]
*  They'll laugh at you, go back and forth with you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=249.6s)]
*  But it was interesting because you would think that I was in Idaho somewhere or South Dakota [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=252.6s)]
*  and a diner because they're saying the same things that all of those people were saying, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=257.6s)]
*  which is the economy is bad right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=261.6s)]
*  Inflation is killing us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=264.6s)]
*  And the border is a huge issue for the men that I spoke with. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=265.6s)]
*  And it's very insulting for them to be struggling and working hard. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=269.6s)]
*  And then you decide that you're just going to give benefits to people that didn't come [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=275.6s)]
*  to the country the right way. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=279.6s)]
*  I think they are the secret weapon in this election. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=282.6s)]
*  Black males, whoever can disrupt that will win. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=285.6s)]
*  If Donald Trump gets 30 percent of the black males support, the election is over. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bqbtGmv7AU&t=289.6s)]
