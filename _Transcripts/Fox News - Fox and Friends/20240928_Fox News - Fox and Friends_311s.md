# I don't think people are buying this at all, Wisconsin senate candidate says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4)
*  Former President Trump rallying voters in Wisconsin today with a focus on border security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=0.0s)]
*  to shore up more votes in that critical battleground state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, concerns remain about the former president's safety as a Secret Service staffing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=9.82s)]
*  shortage forces Trump to move this rally indoors. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=13.56s)]
*  Joining us now is Wisconsin Senate candidate backed by Trump, Eric Hovde. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=17.62s)]
*  Eric, thanks for being here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=21.54s)]
*  We'll get to that event shortage in a moment, but you saw that Kamala Harris went down to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=22.86s)]
*  the border yesterday, spent about 30 minutes there talking to a couple of agents, could [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=27.66s)]
*  have done that in front of a green screen for all it's worth that she got out of it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=33.02s)]
*  How will the voters respond in your mind to this sudden revelation that she's a border hawk? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=36.78s)]
*  Well, first of all, good morning, everyone. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=42.34s)]
*  I hope everybody's off to a great day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=45.3s)]
*  Look, it's a joke. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=48.14s)]
*  I mean, really, it's hard to even conceptualize how this is a tight race at all. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=50.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris has failed at literally everything she has done, most importantly being the borders are. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=55.34s)]
*  As we all know, you know, President Trump pretty much had the border secure. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  And then Harris and Joe Biden came in over three million came in the first year, over three million [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=65.9s)]
*  the second year, well over four million. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=72.06s)]
*  We don't know if that number is 16, 20 million. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=74.22s)]
*  And every state's a border state. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=78.42s)]
*  Look, Wisconsin, they just had an article about the thousand people that got dropped into [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=80.02s)]
*  Whitewater, a small town of about 13, 14000 people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=85.5s)]
*  It's caused a huge mess. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=89.22s)]
*  The budget, the access to housing, health care, all these issues. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=91.22s)]
*  Then the crime issue. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=96.38s)]
*  Why is President Trump going to pair with Dushin? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=97.46s)]
*  Because two weeks ago, a woman was violently raped and brutalized as well as her. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=100.06s)]
*  I think it's her daughter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=106.62s)]
*  They would never say. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=107.74s)]
*  We've had crime all over our state, so I don't think people are buying this at all. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=109.18s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen in Wisconsin? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=115.66s)]
*  I mean, you're in a tight race with Tammy Baldwin. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=118.02s)]
*  All eyes are on Wisconsin. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=120.3s)]
*  You see Kamala Harris clearly feeling the pressure, having to go down to the border and pretend like [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=122.18s)]
*  she cares about that issue, because as you said, every every state is a border state, including Wisconsin. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=127.3s)]
*  And that story is horrific that you just talked about. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=133.38s)]
*  Where do we stand here? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=136.7s)]
*  What does it look like from being on the ground for Trump and also for yourself? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=138.74s)]
*  Look, we're the ultimate battleground state. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  We're a center right state, but, you know, it's going to be a 50-50 race. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=147.5s)]
*  Me and Senator Baldwin, who's so extreme left, are basically in a dead heat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=154.9s)]
*  Same with President Trump and Vice President Harris. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=160.02s)]
*  So whoever wins this state will not only win the presidency, but also will determine the control of the Senate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=163.26s)]
*  for not just two years, probably four years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=171.42s)]
*  So, look, I'm running as hard as possible. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=174.02s)]
*  You know, her whole campaign has been about lies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=176.86s)]
*  She's extreme on everything, you know, pushing a bill to require guys to go into girls' bathrooms and locker rooms, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=179.9s)]
*  playing girls' sports. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=187.3s)]
*  She sent money to a transgender clinic here that does this with children without notifying parents. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=188.34s)]
*  She voted to give illegals cash while we have veterans struggling. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=194.9s)]
*  So this is a critical battleground state. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=199.06s)]
*  Look, I'm doing everything we can. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=202.06s)]
*  I'm just going to say to everybody, we've got to do everything, everyone out there to save this great country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm in this race for one reason. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=209.58s)]
*  I love my country, America, and we're losing it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=211.3s)]
*  It lets us face back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  They've done so much damage. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=215.5s)]
*  So we've got to win. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=216.86s)]
*  I've got to win this race. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=218.06s)]
*  If you can help out, send some money to erichubdy.com. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  But we all have to do our part, talk to our friends or neighbors to make sure we win in November. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=222.38000000000002s)]
*  Eric, one last quick question for you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=227.06s)]
*  The Secret Service has moved that rally for Donald Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=228.9s)]
*  You're talking about how critical the state is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump clearly trying to rally his supporters. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=233.5s)]
*  They've moved his rally indoors. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  Do you feel like this is getting politicized, that, you know, his rallies are having to be under some sort of, you know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  control or they do? How do you feel about that? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=246.06s)]
*  Do you feel like that should have been outdoors or you think they did the right thing? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=248.5s)]
*  Honestly, I'm not quite sure why they would have to move it in because we don't have a lot of tall buildings. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=253.26s)]
*  So you would think they'd be able to protect him when they did the one up in the Wassa area. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=258.66s)]
*  They did it right there on the airport where he flew in, landed his Trump plane, and it was very secure. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  So you may be right, Rachel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=273.3s)]
*  They may be politicizing it, but, you know, I never want to go too far there because I don't know all the ground. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=275.22s)]
*  But think of how sad this is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=281.38000000000005s)]
*  We've had a president twice almost assassinated. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=283.14000000000004s)]
*  So it just tells you the state of politics we're in right now and why we've got to take this country back. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  All right, Eric, I'll be thanks so much for being with us this morning. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=293.38000000000005s)]
*  Hey, thanks, everyone. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=296.58000000000004s)]
*  Everybody have a great day. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq6ObAzcnR4&t=297.98s)]
