# Unearthed video shows Kamala Harris chanting 'down with deportation'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris is reportedly considering visiting the border on Friday as part of her trip to Arizona, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=0.0s)]
*  as she hopes to present herself as tough on immigration. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=7.0s)]
*  But a video from 2018 suggests a different story. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=10.5s)]
*  Up, up with education, down, down with deportation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=15.5s)]
*  Jesus Marquez is a spokesman for Latino Americans for Trump, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Jesus. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=30.5s)]
*  Hello, good morning. Thank you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=36.5s)]
*  Hello. You're welcome. So you see her there dancing, and she's shouting, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=38.5s)]
*  Up, up with education, down, down with deportation. What's your reaction? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=42.5s)]
*  Of course she's going to chant that because she wants open border. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=46.5s)]
*  She has allowed more than 11 million people come across, embedded into the United States, and she's all for open borders. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=50.5s)]
*  I wasn't surprised at all to hear there and see this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=59.5s)]
*  But look, now she also wants to give amnesty for 2 million DACA recipients. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=63.5s)]
*  The problem at the border is not the lack of amnesty. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=68.5s)]
*  The problem at the border is the 11 million people plus that she and Biden have left into the country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=73.5s)]
*  And this is a problem that Latinos across the country are not liking it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=81.5s)]
*  When you ask Hispanics if they like the open border situation, they all say no. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=86.5s)]
*  They don't like the fact that they're jumping the line, that they're coming and taking resources that were supposed to be to Americans, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=91.5s)]
*  and they're taking the jobs too. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=98.5s)]
*  So I hope that if she reconsider, I don't think she will because it's been more than four years now, well, four years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=100.5s)]
*  But this is for the people, the American people, to see what she's all up to and what they want, really. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=106.5s)]
*  Jesus, when she ran for president in 2019, this is what she said at a debate. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=113.5s)]
*  I cannot forget our DACA recipients, and so I'm going to start there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=119.5s)]
*  I will immediately, by executive action, reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=123.5s)]
*  I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=129.5s)]
*  She also said she would protect 6 million illegals from deportation, and she would do that through executive order. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=136.5s)]
*  So Axios contacted her campaign to find out if she was still staying quiet about this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=141.5s)]
*  And this is what Axios reported. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=147.5s)]
*  Asked this week whether she'd take those same executive actions, her campaign declined to answer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=149.5s)]
*  So Jesus, they're not talking about it because they know it's not a winning issue this year. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=156.5s)]
*  Of course not, but they're doing it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=162.5s)]
*  You know, she's talking about protecting 2 million. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=164.5s)]
*  They are already protecting almost 20 million that came across under her watch, under the SARC watch. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=167.5s)]
*  My question is, why doesn't she and even Biden go back and make an executive order to close the border, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=174.5s)]
*  to protect the border, to allow for our country to be secure there at the border? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=182.5s)]
*  She's lacking that, she doesn't care about America. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=187.5s)]
*  That's why we need somebody like Donald Trump who cares for America, will put America's policies first, and that's exactly what we need. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=191.5s)]
*  Hey, Suze, great talking to you. Thank you so much. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=199.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=202.5s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=203.5s)]
*  Fox and Friends did invite the Harris campaign to join us, but we have not heard back. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=204.5s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=207.5s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE_mdeJ4qKs&t=208.5s)]
