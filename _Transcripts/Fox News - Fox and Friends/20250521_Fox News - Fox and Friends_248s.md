# WATCH: Vance on ‘rivalry’ with Rubio
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo)
*  So JD Vance reacted to is he going to run in 2028 and is there a rivalry between JD [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=0.0s)]
*  and Marco Rubio? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=8.08s)]
*  And he said to NBC on Monday, he said, I can just feel it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  The media is going to start telling some story of me versus Marco and me having a rivalry [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=13.68s)]
*  with Marco. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=19.28s)]
*  Most of the time I don't give a blank about this stuff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=20.6s)]
*  I don't even think that much about it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=23.32s)]
*  My attitude is if I do end up running in 2028, I'm not entitled to it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=24.94s)]
*  But I really think that Marco and I could get a lot done together over the next few [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=29.98s)]
*  years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=34.18s)]
*  That's how I think about our friendship and our relationship. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=35.18s)]
*  And I would be shocked if he thought about it any differently. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=37.32s)]
*  I think it's a mistake to try to pit them against each other. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=41.540000000000006s)]
*  I never even thought that they were against each other. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=46.82s)]
*  Politicians have political aspirations. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=50.14s)]
*  And the president named both of them as potential successors. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=53.22s)]
*  And so if you're the media, you're going to try to drive a wedge. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=57.98s)]
*  I don't think it's going to work. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=61.18s)]
*  The president trusts them both. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=62.18s)]
*  They both have his ear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=63.86s)]
*  And they've been working together on so many different things. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=65.68s)]
*  And I think the one unifier is you got Marco Rubio, who was known as more of a hawk. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  And then you got JD Vance, who was more of an isolationist. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=76.16s)]
*  You got the president of the United States, who values both of their perspectives and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  makes the final decision. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=83.32s)]
*  And both of them get in line with whatever agenda that the president decides. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  I think, this is just me personally, there's a world where you see them both on the same [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=89.28s)]
*  ticket. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=93.32s)]
*  Yeah, Mark Halpert said that yesterday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=94.32s)]
*  He says, I've never seen a ticket take shape so quickly, so early. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=95.32s)]
*  But the worst thing you could do for President Trump, in my humble opinion, is start running [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=98.86s)]
*  for president while he's president. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=102.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=103.8s)]
*  I think it's year three. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=104.8s)]
*  He might say, Mr. President, I've got to go. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=106.96s)]
*  But the vice president plays such a vital role for this president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=108.44s)]
*  He uses everybody. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=112.64s)]
*  And he also, you watched the Secretary of State Marco Rubio amongst his Senate colleagues [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=113.64s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=118.44s)]
*  He is ready for action. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=119.44s)]
*  And JD Vance is ready to defend. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=121.0s)]
*  But if I isolated them in a room and I gave them sodium pentothal, I think they're very [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=122.88s)]
*  different on foreign policy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=129.04s)]
*  Right now, the thing that gets them together is they're working for President Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=130.84s)]
*  But I think that if you put them in a room and just said, hey, I want you to construct [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=135.12s)]
*  a course on international relations, they would have different views. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=138.56s)]
*  But they're on the same team. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=142.72s)]
*  It doesn't mean they have to dislike each other. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=143.72s)]
*  It doesn't mean they're going to run against each other. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=145.72s)]
*  They're both doing a great job. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=147.44s)]
*  Marco Rubio is all over the map. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=148.52s)]
*  As Secretary of State, he's meeting with so many world leaders. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  JD Vance met with the pope on Monday and said that he hopes that the pope can help President [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=153.08s)]
*  Trump with the peace. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  He might be hosting the Russia-Ukraine meeting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=162.68s)]
*  He's trying to get him involved with those peace talks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=163.68s)]
*  There was a May survey by JL Partners, and it found 46 percent of the registered voters [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=165.48s)]
*  who were asked in the survey, they're ready to back JD Vance as Trump's successor. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=170.64s)]
*  And then Donald Trump was asked about it on Meet the Press, about the MAGA movement. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=174.76s)]
*  And he said, you look at Marco, you look at JD Vance, who's fantastic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=178.16s)]
*  I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now sitting here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=182.88s)]
*  I think we have a tremendous party. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=185.84s)]
*  All I would say is, look at the people where the president is given the most responsibility. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=187.76s)]
*  You got JD Vance and Marco Rubio. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=193.28s)]
*  I mean, I think Marco has like five jobs at this point as Secretary of State, National [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=195.16s)]
*  Archives, National Security Advisor. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=200.12s)]
*  You got JD Vance that's leading on every conflict, trade deals as well. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  The people that he gives the most on their plate are the people that he trusts the most. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  And lastly, I'm going to say to add to this, if President Trump is successful, the American [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=212.68s)]
*  people want more. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=216.44s)]
*  If you want to turn the page, like with Al Gore and George Bush, they wanted to turn [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=217.72s)]
*  the page on Bill Clinton and the scandals. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=220.4s)]
*  They didn't want to turn the page on Reagan. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=222.28s)]
*  They put Bush 41 there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=223.68s)]
*  It depends on how successful President Trump is at the end, whether JD Vance or somebody [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  else emerges from the administration. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=231.14s)]
*  You just would like to breathe for just a year before you start, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=232.64s)]
*  Oh, my goodness, yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdvuE4KDpCo&t=235.48s)]
