# Cancer rates among men expected to surge by 2050, study shows
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk)
*  Cancer rates among men are expected to surge globally by 2050. According to a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=0.0s)]
*  new study, the American Cancer Society is projecting an 84% increase in cancer [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=6.12s)]
*  cases and a 93% increase in cancer deaths worldwide within the next 30 [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=11.28s)]
*  years. Joining us now with more is Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=16.72s)]
*  Sapphire. Dr. Sapphire, great to see you. So not good news. No, this isn't good [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  news and this is a very large global cancer study and when we talk about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=24.78s)]
*  cancer rates, oftentimes we're talking about here in the United States, but [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=28.48s)]
*  again this is looking at worldwide. It was just released in Cancer magazine and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=31.36s)]
*  what they looked at is by the year 2050 you're gonna have an increased risk of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=35.32s)]
*  not or increased rates of cancer and also cancer death. Now some of this is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=39.88s)]
*  largely attributed to there's just gonna be more people. We have about 8 billion [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=43.9s)]
*  people worldwide now, about 10 billion then, so you have more people you're [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=47.08s)]
*  going to have more deaths. But what they really showed was men over the age of 65 [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=50.8s)]
*  were really going to be at risk for more of these cancers and deaths. So why [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=55.6s)]
*  is that? About 40% of all cancers can be attributed to lifestyle. A third of men [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=59.52s)]
*  worldwide smoke cigarettes still. So obviously tobacco smoke is directly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=64.64s)]
*  linked to cancer and some other diseases, but also sedentary lifestyle and other [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  things. But 60% of cancers have nothing to do with lifestyle. So it's really [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=73.36s)]
*  important to get those cancer screenings and men, as you may know, they don't go [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=78.04s)]
*  to the cancer screenings the same way that women do. So it's very important [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=81.86s)]
*  colonoscopies, mammograms for women, you know, if you have smoked in the past you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=84.96s)]
*  get your lung cancer screenings, your skin check and other because early [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=89.52s)]
*  detection saves lives. And one thing that's really important Ainsley is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  people who have been smoking cigarettes they tend to think the damage is done I [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=95.96s)]
*  might as well keep smoking. That is not true. Within one day of stopping smoking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=99.52s)]
*  your heart rate can go back to normal. Within a couple weeks your [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=103.6s)]
*  cardiovascular disease risk goes down and within weeks to months your risk of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=106.8s)]
*  cancers go down. So if you're smoking you have to quit smoking. Okay good advice. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=111.04s)]
*  When it comes to heart disease we all love coffee, we all love our sodas and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=114.92s)]
*  some people like those energy drinks, but too much of that is a bad thing, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=120.76s)]
*  According to this new study. That's right a very small study out of India they [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=124.64s)]
*  looked at about 92 young healthy adults and they showed that if you're having [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, now 400 milligrams that's a lot [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  that's one of those big venti cups from Starbucks, several of those energy [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=134.84s)]
*  showed that with it you can have an increased blood pressure and we know [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=139.8s)]
*  that caffeine is a stimulant it can increase your blood pressure sometimes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=143.24s)]
*  you can feel a little bit shaky but they're suggesting that maybe long term [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=146.52s)]
*  if you have that much a day you can have hypertension or chronic high blood [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=149.84s)]
*  pressure and that comes with dementia risk and others. We're not quite there [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  with with the data but we can say that you know some coffee is actually good [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  for your health it is actually decreases your risk of cancer and decreases your [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=162.56s)]
*  risk of dementia so as you've heard me say probably a million times over the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=165.96s)]
*  last 10 years everything in moderation I personally love coffee I do stay away [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=169.08s)]
*  from those energy drinks because there are health benefits to coffee with the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  antioxidants some of those energy drinks maybe they just have the stimulant [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=176.8s)]
*  effect. Right I was reading the study 400 milligrams what exactly is that and it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  says it's four cups of coffee or ten cans of soda so that's a lot. Well soda is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=185.72s)]
*  terrible for you, you should not be drinking soda. Or two energy drinks [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=189.96s)]
*  Speaking of soda do you drink or the diet ones I've heard that just have the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=193.96s)]
*  regular one if you're gonna have one don't have the diet ones. My mantra is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  always stay away from those soft drinks regular diet just stick with water [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=201.28s)]
*  something else a little bit healthier there's no health benefit to those [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  whatsoever. Okay they also make the mini ones which is good some of them just need a little sip. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=207.88s)]
*  I mean I hear you again everything in moderation. Okay thank you so much Dr. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCKdYm84DEk&t=212.44s)]
