# NJ drone sightings: State officials accused of knowing more than they're telling
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA)
*  Mysterious drone sightings now in 12 New Jersey counties [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=0.0s)]
*  and it's still unclear where they're coming from. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=5.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, Governor Phil Murphy responds [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=8.52s)]
*  for the first time in a ex post saying, quote, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=10.8s)]
*  there is no known threat to the public at this time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=14.4s)]
*  Do other state Jersey officials agree? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=18.12s)]
*  Well, here with reaction is New Jersey gubernatorial [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=20.16s)]
*  candidate and 101.5 talk radio host, Bill Spadea. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=23.2s)]
*  Bill, it's so great to have you on this morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=27.96s)]
*  So no one has a better pulse on New Jersey than you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  and you know, talk radio. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=33.56s)]
*  So what are your listeners saying to you [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=35.22s)]
*  and what do you think about this? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=40.88s)]
*  You know, we've got the largest audience in the state [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=41.72s)]
*  and I have to say that I've got to give credit [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=43.86s)]
*  to my friend Mark Taylor, who is the mayor of Florham Park [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=46.0s)]
*  in Morris County because back on the 16th, 17th, 18th [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=48.72s)]
*  of November, a few weeks ago, he called the show [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=53.72s)]
*  and he said, Bill, there are drones over my house. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=56.2s)]
*  And last night there was a Black Hawk helicopter [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  that was sitting in front of them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=61.88s)]
*  He said, I have no idea what's going on, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=63.24s)]
*  but I've called the FAA. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=65.04s)]
*  I'm calling the state police. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  And here we are weeks later and it's increasing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=68.8s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=72.44s)]
*  And you know, according to reports, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=73.28s)]
*  I literally have done my entire show in the last week [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=74.76s)]
*  and a half has been on this drone issue [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  because callers from all over the state are calling in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=81.08s)]
*  to say some of these drones are the size of cars. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=84.24s)]
*  And what it occurred to me that when the state police [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=87.8s)]
*  and the FBI are asking for our help, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  how do they not know what's happening? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  So a lot of people believe that state officials [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=96.36s)]
*  may in fact know a lot more than they're telling us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=99.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, and by the way, I'm one of those people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=102.32s)]
*  I saw it outside of my house twice. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=104.08s)]
*  My kids recorded it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=106.08s)]
*  They were freaking out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  They are big and they fly kind of low. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's really disconcerting that our governor [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=110.24s)]
*  can't tell us what's going on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=112.84s)]
*  That, you know, and then they said, call the sheriff. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=114.48s)]
*  And then the sheriff says, call the FBI. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=117.28s)]
*  And then the FBI is saying, give us more information. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=119.16s)]
*  And remember, Bill, we had a balloon that flew, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=122.12s)]
*  a Chinese balloon that flew over our country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  And not only did our government lie about it, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=127.04s)]
*  but they did nothing about it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=129.8s)]
*  So do you think that these are foreign, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=131.28s)]
*  that this is a foreign country? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Is this Google, you know, with their drone package [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=134.84s)]
*  testing something? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=139.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=140.2s)]
*  I think if it was something as simple as Google or Amazon, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=141.52s)]
*  something like that, it would have been very easy [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=144.8s)]
*  to put out a statement, say, hey, guys, don't mind the drones. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=146.68s)]
*  We're not under attack. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  What really bothered many people, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=151.68s)]
*  certainly in my audience, is when we called out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  the governor earlier this week, he did not make a statement [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=157.08s)]
*  until after thousands of our listeners [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=160.56s)]
*  flooded the state house with calls saying, governor, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=163.0s)]
*  what is going on? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  What did you know? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=167.12s)]
*  When did you know it? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=167.96s)]
*  Why are you not saying anything? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=168.84s)]
*  It's strange to me, though, if you think about the size [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=170.36s)]
*  of these drones, it's not like they can stay airborne forever. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  They've got to land somewhere. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=177.08s)]
*  Chances are they're landing somewhere locally. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  Why is it only happening at night? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  Why is it happening on and around our military bases, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=182.44000000000003s)]
*  both the Joint Base in Monmouth, Picatinny Arsenal [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  in North Jersey? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=189.52s)]
*  So there are a lot of questions, and it leads many of us [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=190.56s)]
*  to believe that they do know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=193.84s)]
*  But I think the simplest explanation [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=195.0s)]
*  is that this is some kind of a military test. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=197.68s)]
*  I just wish they would come out and say, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  here's what we're doing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=202.84s)]
*  And I have said, when I'm elected governor, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  we're not going to have this secrecy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=206.08s)]
*  coming from the state house. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  We're going to have total transparency [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=209.24s)]
*  because it's clear someone knows what's happening. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  We just aren't being told. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, Bill, they're also flying over Trump Bedminster, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  which has a lot of people concerned as well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  And I agree, we need more transparency. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  We ought to know what's flying over our house. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=224.28s)]
*  By the way, there was a guy in Florida [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=225.92s)]
*  who once shot down a drone. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  He didn't know it was illegal to do so. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=229.16s)]
*  He got in a lot of trouble. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  So people feel like this is right over my house. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=232.44s)]
*  It was right in front of my window. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  I know I don't own the airspace, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  but it's disconcerting when it's so close [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=238.56s)]
*  to your home and your children. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  And we ought to get answers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=242.92s)]
*  Bill, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  If there are any updates, you gotta let us know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  We wanna get to the bottom of this story. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  I will certainly let you know. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=251.64s)]
*  We'll be on this starting tomorrow again. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=252.48s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=254.68s)]
*  Take care. Thanks. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqSCF7XrdA&t=255.52s)]
