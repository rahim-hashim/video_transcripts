# 'ON THE CLOCK': Dems urged to condemn violent threats against Trump nominees
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4)
*  Well, the FBI is investigating after a number of president-elect Trump's cabinet nominees [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=0.0s)]
*  and other appointees were targeted in a string of violent threats, but they remain defiant. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=9.52s)]
*  I'm not going to be intimidated by these people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=17.36s)]
*  They're not going to silence me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Look, I'm going to do this job. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=21.84s)]
*  I'm going to do this job because it's an issue of national security. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=23.64s)]
*  So you're not going to shut me up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going away and I'm going to do this job and I'm going to continue talking to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=28.8s)]
*  American people why it needs to be done. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=32.72s)]
*  The latest threats come just months after two assassination attempts on president-elect [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=40.72s)]
*  So will President Biden and Democratic leaders speak out and condemn this? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=41.72s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former Congressman Jason Chaffetz joins me now to discuss. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=46.36s)]
*  Jason, will they, will they come out unequivocally and condemn this frightening threats of violence? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=51.68s)]
*  Well, they're on the clock right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=58.8s)]
*  Good morning, Emily and happy Thanksgiving. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=60.28s)]
*  But they're on the clock. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=62.28s)]
*  They could have done it yesterday. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=63.48s)]
*  They better darn well do it today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=64.64s)]
*  I don't have a whole lot of confidence. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=66.48s)]
*  Remember, we have a United States Supreme Court. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  They haven't offered the resources to protect the Supreme Court justices. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=70.72s)]
*  So here you have the incoming Trump administration. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=74.78s)]
*  You're not going to intimidate somebody like Tom Homan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=77.4s)]
*  I mean, come on, really? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=79.92s)]
*  Of all the people out there, you think you're going to intimidate that group of people? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=81.12s)]
*  It's just not going to happen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=85.32s)]
*  But what's concerning about this is it doesn't seem like it's some, you know, one person [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=86.6s)]
*  who is just off their meds to be able to target those nine people and beyond. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  There's a coordinated effort here and the FBI has got to get on top of it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  Not only do they have to identify, but they need to charge and then prosecute these people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=100.74s)]
*  America needs to see consequences for people that are threatening other people's lives. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=106.08s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=110.6s)]
*  This is like the one group where it's like, yeah, mess around and find out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=111.6s)]
*  Of course, no one would be deterred. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Of course, they will all be staunchly defiant. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=116.4s)]
*  So it begs the question, Jason, why then do these people feel emboldened to do so? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=119.12s)]
*  And do you have faith in the machine of law enforcement at this moment in terms of those [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=124.48s)]
*  leadership at the top to actually create and hold them accountable so that this does stop? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=128.4s)]
*  Well, I could tell you having served more than eight years in Congress, virtually almost [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=134.04s)]
*  every single member of Congress at some point is going to get some serious threats. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=139.96s)]
*  When I was chairman of the Oversight Committee, we had a person out of Florida that was giving [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=144.6s)]
*  death threats that they were going to do some horrific things to me. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=148.68s)]
*  Law enforcement followed through. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=152.76s)]
*  They actually charged him and that person went to jail. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=154.0s)]
*  But that was an exception. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=156.56s)]
*  I had threats coming from other parts of the country and they need to follow up on them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=157.76s)]
*  And whether it's online, whether it's on X or Facebook or whatever, that's just not acceptable [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=162.76s)]
*  behavior and there needs to be some consequences. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=168.48s)]
*  And there needs to be, to your point, the unequivocal condemnation by leadership in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=171.28s)]
*  that party, including our current president and vice president, to take 30 seconds and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=175.28s)]
*  come out and say we will not stand for this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=179.4s)]
*  But unfortunately, I'm not holding my breath. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=181.96s)]
*  Fortunately, I am grateful for you, Jason. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=183.96s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving and we will see you soon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=185.88s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2yhb1_CI4&t=188.46s)]
