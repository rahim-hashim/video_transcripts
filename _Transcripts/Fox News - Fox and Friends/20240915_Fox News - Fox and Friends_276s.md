# It is ‘very hard’ for Harris to connect with voters on top issues: Maria Bartiromo
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g)
*  All right, well, it's the number one issue for voters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=0.0s)]
*  And apparently, Vice President Harris [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=2.6s)]
*  is still struggling to blunt Trump's edge on the economy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=4.26s)]
*  Democratic and anti-Trump strategists are saying, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  she missed a chance to connect with voters [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  over her economic plans and to chip away [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=14.36s)]
*  at Trump's reputation for fostering [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=17.04s)]
*  a historically strong pre-COVID economy, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  his most formidable asset. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=22.44s)]
*  It comes as new signs point to Americans [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  struggling to keep up with their bills, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=26.88s)]
*  setting off alarms on Wall Street. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=28.88s)]
*  Sunday Morning Futures anchor Maria Bartiromo [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=31.16s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=33.76s)]
*  Maria, it's so great to have you on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=35.28s)]
*  You know, you would think she would know [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=37.2s)]
*  she's running for president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=38.68s)]
*  We're two months away from the election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  The number one issue is the economy, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=41.84s)]
*  and she hasn't prepared an answer on the economy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=44.04s)]
*  You're right, Rachel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=47.4s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=48.56s)]
*  But one of the problems is it's gonna be very hard [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  for her to connect with voters on that issue [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  since she is very much behind the major issue [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=55.0s)]
*  of inflation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=58.84s)]
*  Remember, they spent $7 trillion on Joe Biden [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=59.84s)]
*  and Kamala Harris' watch, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  largely due to their climate change agenda, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=64.64s)]
*  and that sent inflation soaring. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  So even though inflation is off of the highs of the year, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=69.68s)]
*  you're still talking about prices, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  inflation overall being 20% higher [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=74.44s)]
*  in the last three and a half years [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=77.0s)]
*  under Kamala Harris' reign, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=78.28s)]
*  while real wages are down 2%. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=79.84s)]
*  So the obvious question for anybody is, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=82.76s)]
*  are you better off today than you were four years ago? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=84.92s)]
*  And the obvious answer is no, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=88.4s)]
*  because it's way too expensive, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=90.48s)]
*  expensive for essentials, food, energy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  And clearly, if President Trump has his way, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=95.72s)]
*  he's going to tap into the energy capacity in America. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=98.72s)]
*  That will put more oil on the global market, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=102.0s)]
*  push prices down, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  and alleviate one of the main issues for inflation, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  which is the price of oil and gas, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=108.28s)]
*  including higher interest rates. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=111.04s)]
*  You just mentioned that Wall Street is getting nervous. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=115.92s)]
*  with a couple of stories this morning. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=117.0s)]
*  And one of the big issues here is that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=118.68s)]
*  consumer lending companies were down last week [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=120.64s)]
*  because the CEOs of those companies [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=123.32s)]
*  are talking about warnings that lower income borrowers [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=125.32s)]
*  are still struggling. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=128.88s)]
*  Now this upcoming week, the Federal Reserve is meeting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=130.28s)]
*  They're gonna be meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=132.4s)]
*  and we are expecting the Fed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=134.28s)]
*  to cut interest rates on Wednesday. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  But that's going to spike a lot of commentary on the right [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=138.24s)]
*  that the Fed is being political. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=141.72s)]
*  Why are you cutting interest rates in September, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=143.28s)]
*  50 days before a major presidential election? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=146.0s)]
*  That's going to certainly trigger lots of people to say [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  it was all political. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=152.96s)]
*  So we're talking about that this morning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=153.96s)]
*  By the way, JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=155.44s)]
*  spoke with institutional investors this last week, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=157.8s)]
*  and he said, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=161.24s)]
*  there is still the opportunity for the worst outcome [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=162.08s)]
*  for America's future. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  The worst outcome is inflation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=165.68s)]
*  That is slowing growth and higher inflation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  So it's an issue, and it's a kitchen table issue. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=169.96s)]
*  Everybody's talking about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  That's why it's the number one issue. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  So what do you have on the show today? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=175.24s)]
*  We're talking about that with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=176.84s)]
*  We've also got election integrity [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  as the number one issue for voters as well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=182.0s)]
*  Because remember, no matter what issue you're looking at, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  whether it's inflation, immigration, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  at the end of the day, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=188.96s)]
*  it's about who counts the votes, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=189.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=191.36s)]
*  So we're gonna talk about the opportunity [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  to have a fair and transparent election [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  with Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=196.8s)]
*  He's got a big plan in place right now for Florida [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=198.24s)]
*  that he is saying fraud will be prosecuted [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  in terms of this election. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=204.16s)]
*  So we're gonna talk about election integrity [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=206.04s)]
*  with all of my guests this morning [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=208.04s)]
*  after that debate last week. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=209.68s)]
*  That's gonna be one of the big issues here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=211.84s)]
*  and certainly one of the most important for Republicans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=214.08s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, Senator Tom Cotton, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=216.88s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, Representative Mills, and Brian Steele [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=220.24s)]
*  are gonna get into how the issue has affected Capitol Hill. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=223.32s)]
*  They're trying to attach the SAVE Act [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=226.76s)]
*  to the continuing resolution. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=228.88s)]
*  We'll find out why Cory Mills is against that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  And then Michelle Tafoya, former NFL sideline reporter, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=233.28s)]
*  she's lived in Minnesota for 30 years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=236.48s)]
*  We're gonna talk to her about Tim Walters' Minnesota [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=238.96s)]
*  and why for 30 years she says [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=243.76s)]
*  it has been against the citizens there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=246.2s)]
*  So we wanna get a sense into Tim Walters' policies as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=248.88s)]
*  Well, I can't wait and I'm so glad [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=253.56s)]
*  that you're covering the all important issue [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=254.96s)]
*  of election integrity. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=256.96s)]
*  Everything hinges on that, Maria. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=258.56s)]
*  You're always on point over the target. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRiv0Yn54g&t=259.96s)]
