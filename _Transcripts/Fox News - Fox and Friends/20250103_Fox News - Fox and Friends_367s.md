# Obama DHS secretary issues bold warning ahead of Inauguration, Super Bowl
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps)
*  People in New Orleans are sending an unmistakable message. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=0.0s)]
*  They will not let this attack or the attackers' deluded ideology overcome us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=5.2s)]
*  None of us should fear that it will overcome us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=10.8s)]
*  We're going to continue to relentlessly pursue ISIS and other terrorist organizations where [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=14.24s)]
*  they are, and they'll find no safe harbor here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=18.2s)]
*  President Biden vowing to take on ISIS following the terror attack in New Orleans after meeting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=23.6s)]
*  with his Homeland Security team in the Situation Room. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=28.24s)]
*  The questions remain about the reason behind the rise in terror threat and what the incoming [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=31.0s)]
*  Trump administration can do to stop it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=34.96s)]
*  Jay Johnson served as DHS Secretary under President Obama and joins us now in studio. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=37.68s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, if you had a meeting today to talk about two days since the attack and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=41.76s)]
*  you had all your department heads there, what would be the first thing you'd begin to ask? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  What would you begin to probe? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=53.2s)]
*  What would you begin to do? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, here's what I would say, first of all. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  We're in the midst of an evolving, heightened threat picture right now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=60.4s)]
*  With the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, with the attack two days ago, I'm sure ISIS [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=67.74s)]
*  feels emboldened right now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=75.44s)]
*  And we have several major security events coming up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=78.48s)]
*  The inauguration for one, the Super Bowl, and a couple weeks after that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=81.44s)]
*  And I would say what I did say to my people at DHS when I was in office, don't just respond [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=85.92s)]
*  to the last attack. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=92.68s)]
*  Anticipate the next one, which may be of a very different character. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=94.68s)]
*  Now, we've known for some time that the possibility of an attack with a vehicle, a vehicle is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=98.84s)]
*  a weapon or a mass shooting, is something to anticipate and prepare for. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=105.0s)]
*  We should not believe that we've seen the last of this type of vehicle attack. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=111.92s)]
*  But I always encourage my people, be vigilant and think about what could come next. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=118.84s)]
*  Don't just plug the last hole. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=124.48s)]
*  So Mr. Secretary, what do you make, I mean, the intel community, the counterterrorism [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=126.72s)]
*  groups with inside of the country, both Democrat and Republican, and they come from that 9-11 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=132.16s)]
*  country first and they fight for the country as a result of that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=138.08s)]
*  But there's been many people inside the community that said, we're focused on the wrong things. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=143.28s)]
*  We're not focusing on the ideology of these folks going after them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=148.28s)]
*  We're seeing people in the middle of the street with ISIS flags and Hamas flags. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=152.44s)]
*  These are threats to the country. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=156.82000000000002s)]
*  Sunday, right after the event. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=160.24s)]
*  Is it fair to say that we're not focusing on the right things right now? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=162.46s)]
*  I'll count myself as among the 9-11 community. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=166.96s)]
*  I was here in Manhattan on 9-11, 2001. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=171.08s)]
*  I was in the Pentagon as the senior legal official, 2009 to 2012, and we took a lot [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  of these guys out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=180.68s)]
*  For a while, you can see the terrorist threat to our country evolving from terrorist-directed [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  attacks where a terrorist organization overseas directs a large-scale attack on the United [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=189.12s)]
*  States, 9-11 being the prime example, the attempted underwear bombing, you may recall, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=195.16s)]
*  the attempted shoe bombing, Richard Reeves. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=200.32s)]
*  Those were terrorist-directed attacks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=203.16s)]
*  We evolved from that in about 2013, 2014, to what we now refer to as terrorist-inspired [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=205.8s)]
*  attacks where a terrorist organization on the Internet will attempt to inspire someone [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=213.04s)]
*  who is living in this country to radicalize and take it upon themselves to carry out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  a terrorist attack. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=226.44s)]
*  We saw a spate of these in 2014, 2015, 2016 when I was in DHS, and that threat has not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=227.44s)]
*  gone away, and I'm concerned that it's at a heightened level right now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, critics argue that in part the current administration has emboldened [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=243.0s)]
*  these inspired terrorist attacks in part because taking the eye off the ball, focusing toward [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  Americans as well as sort of a different focus instead of on threats, on one of phraseology [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  and sort of a tepid approach to the international community. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  The question, sir, is what do you want to see in the next administration so that we [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=262.48s)]
*  take steps forward and not steps back? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=266.52s)]
*  Well, no matter who the president is, no matter whose administration it is, I believe there [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=269.08s)]
*  needs to be an intense focus among counterterrorism officials in multiple agencies right now on [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=275.68s)]
*  this evolving, heightened threat picture that we see right now, no matter who the president [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=282.68s)]
*  is. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=288.88s)]
*  And there are counterterrorism professionals in the Pentagon, at the FBI, at NCTC, CIA, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=290.2s)]
*  ODNI, multiple agencies that are charged with looking at this evolving threat picture, our [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=297.2s)]
*  political leadership has to pay close attention to the evolving intelligence picture to make [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  sure we set the right priorities and we do not take our eye off the ball. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=309.08s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, foreign governments, as you know, help you. This guy went over there for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  ten days in Egypt. And if he was hanging out with the wrong guys, the way I've been told, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=317.28s)]
*  when the communication's good, we find out about it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=323.68s)]
*  That is absolutely true. I can testify from personal experience that the relationships [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=326.4s)]
*  we have with other governments, other intelligence communities is crucial to preventing someone, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=334.2s)]
*  even from entering the United States, getting into this hemisphere. If you have a good relationship [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  with an intelligence agency overseas, one where on the surface we don't have such a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=346.36s)]
*  great relationship, you can get a tip from that intelligence agency. Hey, we just found [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=351.32s)]
*  out such and such may be trying to come to your hemisphere. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  Super beneficial. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=360.64s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, great to see you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=361.68s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for coming in, especially this time. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjDb_Hb5ps&t=363.91999999999996s)]
