# BREAKING: White House says 15+ trade deal offers on the table
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w)
*  All right, you can call it the art of the deal, of the tariff deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=0.0s)]
*  The European Union's pulling plans to put retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods after President [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Trump's decision for a 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=11.72s)]
*  One country not getting a break, China. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=15.68s)]
*  President Trump raising tariffs on Chinese goods to an astronomical 125 percent. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=18.68s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us live. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=26.44s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=29.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=30.4s)]
*  And a lot went into President Trump's decision to pause the tariffs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=31.4s)]
*  He watched Republican senators for an hour on Hannity on Tuesday night and then talked [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  to them for about an hour afterwards, according to The Washington Post. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=40.08s)]
*  He also gave more authority with public statements to the Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=44.08s)]
*  he watched as our ally Japan started dumping Treasury bonds. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=50.64s)]
*  Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=60.72s)]
*  No other president would have done what I did. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=65.92s)]
*  No other president. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=67.88s)]
*  I know the presidents. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=68.88s)]
*  They wouldn't have done it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=69.88s)]
*  And it had to be done. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=70.88s)]
*  The pause is met with a pause from the Europeans. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=72.64s)]
*  The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen just wrote, we took note of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  announcement by President Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=80.56s)]
*  We want to give negotiations a chance. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  While finalizing the adoption of the EU countermeasures that saw strong support from our member states, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=84.8s)]
*  we will put them on hold for 90 days. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=90.12s)]
*  And the Goldman Sachs decision to pull their recession prediction came after a great day [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=93.08s)]
*  on Wall Street yesterday. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=98.34s)]
*  The Dow finished up 8 percent, the S&P up 9.5 percent, the Nasdaq up 12 percent. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=99.96s)]
*  And White House officials want credit with 15 countries offering new trade deals, 70 [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=106.52s)]
*  plus countries calling the top tariff rates. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=112.88s)]
*  He made, I think, the absolutely right decisive call to go with really the bigger move rather [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=116.52s)]
*  than announce one or two trade deals, but go with a bigger move so that everybody in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=120.78s)]
*  the world understands that he means what he says, that he wants people to be fair to American [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=124.0s)]
*  workers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=129.68s)]
*  According to an item in the Wall Street Journal today, President Trump was prepared for the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=131.2s)]
*  new tariff policy to lead to a recession in the United States, but the concern started [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=134.84s)]
*  growing that there could be a depression. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=139.2s)]
*  That is what he wanted to avoid. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  That is why they got ahead of any kind of a decline like that with this pause. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=148.54s)]
*  And Peter, so you said that the country of Japan was dumping the U.S. treasuries, and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=149.54s)]
*  that's one of the red warning lights there on the resolute desk in the Oval Office. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=157.33999999999997s)]
*  But China, who right now is our trade adversary, China owns close to a trillion dollars' use [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=163.06s)]
*  worth of U.S. treasuries. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=169.77999999999997s)]
*  So if they started dumping them, that could be not a good thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=171.9s)]
*  That would be a problem. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=176.9s)]
*  And there are also reports now that the Chinese are going to try to essentially take their [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=178.1s)]
*  new position as the White House is trying to make them the bad guys of trade in the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=184.94s)]
*  world, that they're going to just start flooding the world marketplace with cheaper goods, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=189.86s)]
*  not only to hurt the U.S. but also to hurt other American trading partners. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=195.18s)]
*  And so that could be their way around if there is not a deal soon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=200.26s)]
*  Obviously, that's something that can't happen overnight. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=204.62s)]
*  But the Chinese are known for building huge entire cities very quickly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=206.86s)]
*  So if they want to start building factories to flood the global marketplace with cheap [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=211.34s)]
*  goods, they could. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=216.1s)]
*  But it is worth just looking at this whole thing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=217.38s)]
*  We don't know how it is going to play out, even today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=219.66s)]
*  But a month ago, there were not countries lining up to make trade deals with the United [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=223.04s)]
*  States. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=229.04s)]
*  So today, at a minimum, President Trump has completely, he wants to rebalance the economy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  of the world. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=238.04s)]
*  We don't know if that's going to work yet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=239.16s)]
*  But he has at a minimum completely changed the conversation about trade everywhere on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  the planet. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  And we were interviewing Kevin Hassett. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  He said that there at least, we know that we've heard there are 70, 75 countries that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=251.44s)]
*  have come to the table or at least called the president. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=255.54s)]
*  He said there are 15 countries that have actually turned in deals. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=259.32s)]
*  He said, we're not sure. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you which countries those are. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=265.08s)]
*  And he said, I'm not sure if we're going to accept those deals. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=267.32s)]
*  There might have to be some negotiations. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=270.08s)]
*  But that's very promising. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=271.84s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=273.11999999999995s)]
*  We're in a much better place today than we were a month ago. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=274.44s)]
*  That can't be understated. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  Are you hearing anything, Peter, any of your sources telling you which countries might [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  have turned in these deals? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  That was big news on Fox and Friends 20 minutes ago from Hassett that there are 15 deals in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=285.52s)]
*  theory. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  We don't know other than the Japanese and the South Koreans and the EU are at the top [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  of the list. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=298.4s)]
*  And so they might not want to shake things up too much every day. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=299.4s)]
*  But the next time, this is a president who is very, very good at changing the subject [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=304.2s)]
*  and changing the conversation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=309.06s)]
*  We saw that yesterday. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  So they might let yesterday's pause breathe a little bit. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  And the next time that they need to change the conversation, that is probably when we [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=315.44s)]
*  are going to get an announcement about the first deals. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=319.56s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=322.8s)]
*  Brian, let's bring you back in because I think the conversation has to go to look, no matter [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=323.8s)]
*  what deal is done, it's a lot better than what we were getting for these other countries [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=330.08s)]
*  to begin with. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=334.64s)]
*  Plus, we've isolated our number one enemy, China. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=335.64s)]
*  Yeah, and they probably have a few moves like they have our debt, but they've really stopped [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=340.8s)]
*  buying our debt. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=345.2s)]
*  Right now, the futures are going to give back. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=346.2s)]
*  It looks like we're off 500 points when we open up. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=348.0s)]
*  I'm going to see. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=350.92s)]
*  I'm very curious to see why that would be. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=351.92s)]
*  But I also see that when we look at the import-export balance, it's a little bit more balanced in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=354.64s)]
*  years past. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  But U.S. exports to China, 143 billion. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, that'll hurt because they upped our tariffs. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  But the U.S. imports from China, 438 billion. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=366.2s)]
*  What we've got to do is two things. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  We've got to massively look for other places to make our stuff while breaking it at home. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=371.36s)]
*  In the short term, we're not going to be able to start all of a sudden making shirts and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  going into textiles and getting all the parts for cars. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=379.56s)]
*  So in the meantime, the Philippines could do a lot of textiles. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=382.88s)]
*  Vietnam, drop that 26 or 46 percent on Vietnam. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=385.72s)]
*  Allow these people, these garment makers to be, their shirt makers, the people that make [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  our clothes, they want to go to Vietnam, go do it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=395.32000000000005s)]
*  The best way to show China, we don't need them because we have to decouple. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=398.52s)]
*  That's the message. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=403.32s)]

*  Yesterday, the S&P 500 surging 9.5 percent. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  It's third best day since 1940. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=416.56s)]
*  The president, however, is still pushing aggressively against China, raising tariffs even more against [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=419.88s)]
*  the communist nation to 125 percent. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=425.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, for the other nations, the reciprocal tariff have been paused for 90 days, but a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=428.12s)]
*  10 percent baseline will still be in place. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=433.2s)]
*  We've got the best guest to talk about this. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=436.36s)]
*  He is the director of the National Economic Council. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=438.36s)]
*  Kevin Hassett joins us from the North Lawn. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=440.68s)]
*  Good morning to you, Kevin. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=442.32s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=443.32s)]
*  Hey, guys. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=444.32s)]
*  I see that shortly after they paused, you went into the Oval Office with some other [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=445.32s)]
*  high ranking officials and you talked about, among other things, the fact that one of the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=450.44s)]
*  things that was freaking people out is there was a gigantic sell off in the U.S. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  bond market. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=460.44s)]
*  And U.S. bonds, treasuries have always been seen as the gold standard around the world. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=461.44s)]
*  And if there are cracks in that, we're all kind of screwed. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=465.48s)]
*  Well, as an economist, I can say that my judgment yesterday morning as I was watching [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=469.04s)]
*  interest rates climb up quite a bit, that a lot of the people who normally buy U.S. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=473.04s)]
*  treasuries were wondering whether the president was really serious about what he was saying [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=478.56s)]
*  when he was saying that we're going to renegotiate better deals for the American people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=483.0s)]
*  And I knew he was serious and he knew he was serious. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=487.16s)]
*  And we had been working on plans for the negotiations for weeks and even a couple of deals lined [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=490.52000000000004s)]
*  up that maybe were close to being announced. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=496.36s)]
*  And we're getting ready to talk about, well, what's the next stage? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=498.56s)]
*  What's the next step for the negotiations? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=502.16s)]
*  I even yesterday morning was on a call with the president, with the Swiss president, talking [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  about a Swiss trade deal. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=509.16s)]
*  And so the point is everything was moving. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=511.44s)]
*  But then when the bond market started to say, hey, we don't believe these guys, I think [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=513.04s)]
*  the president decided on his own really that, well, we're going to announce this anyway. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=517.24s)]
*  We might as well do it today. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=521.72s)]
*  There's a little bit of an extra push for the bond market. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=522.9599999999999s)]
*  But this is the plan that he that he was pursuing all along. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  Did you know about that? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=528.8s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=529.8s)]
*  Did you know this was part of his plan? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=530.8s)]
*  He was going to do that? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=532.36s)]
*  He had options that he was that he wanted us to prepare in a very orderly fashion, unanimity [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=533.36s)]
*  between everybody from Peter Navarro to Howard Letnick to Scott Bessett to be and vice president. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=538.0s)]
*  He was also in on it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=545.2s)]
*  And the fact is that there were options for the president. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=546.88s)]
*  That's always what he likes to see. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=549.32s)]
*  And then he had the options that he was thinking about them. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=550.88s)]
*  And then he made, I think, the absolutely right decisive call to go with really the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=553.36s)]
*  bigger move rather than announce one or two trade deals. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  We go with a bigger move so that everybody in the world understands that he means what [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=559.36s)]
*  he says, that he wants people to be fair to American workers. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=563.24s)]
*  And we saw so much progress, so much progress in the last few weeks once we started to announce [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  that we're going to do this and then actually do it, that the president was sure that the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=572.3599999999999s)]
*  process was being successful and so he could move ahead to the next step. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=575.56s)]
*  So Kevin, let's talk China. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=578.68s)]
*  And when you look at some of the numbers, it's pretty stunning. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=579.68s)]
*  When you talk about the U.S. exports to China, it's one hundred and forty three billion dollars. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=583.4799999999999s)]
*  The imports from China are four hundred and thirty eight billion. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=587.16s)]
*  When you look at the deficit with China, it's negative two hundred and ninety five billion dollars. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=591.4s)]
*  So what's the goal, Kevin, always to isolate China and push them to the negotiating table? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't look like they're caving yet, but it looks like that's the president's goal, right? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=605.0s)]
*  Well, I think his first goal always was to advantage American workers. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=609.88s)]
*  Remember, when China entered the WTO, then for the next 15 years, real wages in the United [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=613.84s)]
*  States went down by about twelve hundred dollars cumulatively. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=619.68s)]
*  So all those cheap products didn't make welfare better off for American citizens because wages [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  went down by more than prices because of the low demand for American workers. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  And so what President Trump's been doing is he's been trying to drive up demand for workers, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=632.4799999999999s)]
*  drive up wages so that real welfare improves. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=636.3599999999999s)]
*  And he's highly confident that this policy will accomplish it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=639.16s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of disruption for China right now because they've been dumping [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=642.04s)]
*  into the U.S. and doing so, I think, as a strategy that has national defense implications. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=646.32s)]
*  And so what's going on right now with China is that the ships that are filled with Chinese [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  products don't know where to go. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  They're stuck in port. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=659.1600000000001s)]
*  The factories that are making the Chinese goods, they're going to have to slow down [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=660.2800000000001s)]
*  because they don't have ships to load the stuff into. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=664.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's going to put a lot of pressure on China to stop its bad acting and to come [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  to the table. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=671.24s)]
*  And, Kevin, before the president paused the tariffs, The Wall Street Journal says, and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=672.48s)]
*  they talked to a couple of people who were close to the president's thinking, the president [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=680.0s)]
*  knew and he talked about how, you know, we're all going to feel some pain. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=684.2s)]
*  You're going to feel some pain. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=688.28s)]
*  He knew there was pain. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=689.44s)]
*  He knew it could, the tariffs could trigger a recession. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=690.64s)]
*  His worry was that it would cause a depression. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=695.52s)]
*  Did you know that the president was concerned with a depression? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=699.44s)]
*  If I think that you have to think about what the scenarios were that we were playing out [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=703.36s)]
*  for the president. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=709.08s)]
*  One scenario is that we come out with tariffs and non-tariff barriers that are at the level [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  of our trading partners and they don't respond. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=715.96s)]
*  And in that scenario, it's going to be pretty bad for the global economy. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  But the good news is that we're making America great again with Trump policies, but we're [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=722.7s)]
*  also rebuilding the global order because the other countries that are coming to the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=727.08s)]
*  table are more or less going to be adopting Trump, you know, anti-globalist policies as [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=730.88s)]
*  well. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=735.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's going to be great for their workers and it's going to be great for our workers. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  Kevin, what about the deals? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=739.0400000000001s)]
*  We want to see deals. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=740.84s)]
*  We want to see win after win after win. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=741.84s)]
*  We want to see countries coming into the White House signing deals. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=743.48s)]
*  When will that happen? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=746.5200000000001s)]
*  And which countries? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=747.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm not going to name the countries yet. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=748.5200000000001s)]
*  In fact, we have a meeting today with all the top principals where we're going to present [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  to the president a list of what we think his priorities might look like. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=754.88s)]
*  And I'm sure he's going to have his own ideas about where to move things. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=757.84s)]
*  But I could tell you that we've already got offers on the table for more than 15 countries, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=761.92s)]
*  15 countries. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=766.52s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean there's a deal, but it means that you've heard the much larger [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=767.52s)]
*  number for people who call and they want to talk. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=770.88s)]
*  But there are specific offers on the table. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  I've been informed from USTR of about 15 countries right now. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  And so this is moving fast. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=778.68s)]
*  The thing that I joked about when we said the 90-day pause is that we're going to go [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=780.52s)]
*  around the world in 80 days and have 10 days of rest. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=783.84s)]
*  That's our plan. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2CawXX-w&t=787.72s)]
