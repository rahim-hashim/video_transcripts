# Jack Keane: We haven't seen a threat like this in decades
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E)
*  Seeds fires talks in a standstill as Israel infiltrates Rafa, where we know the two battalions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=0.0s)]
*  left of Hamas are located. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=5.08s)]
*  While on the home front, President Biden threatens and is about to block weapons deliveries to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=7.68s)]
*  our primary ally, Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=12.08s)]
*  The White House doubling down on the president's remarks, claiming it was not a senior moment, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=14.4s)]
*  but lawmakers like Senator Joe Manchin told me on an interview you'll see on Saturday [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=18.12s)]
*  night on One Nation, Biden's making a mistake. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Now making decisions on what you can and what you can't use, you have to do our way or [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=26.8s)]
*  no way at all, that's not who we are and it's not what we should be doing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=30.8s)]
*  I have said, I've been asked today about and I've said openly that I think it's wrong. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  I think that we shouldn't be. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=39.96s)]
*  Yeah, but the president's not interested in moderate points of view it seems. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=41.8s)]
*  Here to react, Fox News senior strategic analyst and retired four-star general Jack Keene. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=44.72s)]
*  General, what does this mean? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=50.24s)]
*  Just holding back weapons shipments, but they still have weapons they can use. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=52.56s)]
*  What does this mean for overall how we're viewed around the world and for our ally? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=56.18s)]
*  Yeah, well certainly in terms of the arms themselves, Israel has plenty of weapon systems [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=60.9s)]
*  and ammunition available to complete the operation in Ra'a. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=67.1s)]
*  But it is a major turning point. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=71.7s)]
*  I mean, you know, the administration has been hinting at this, you know, for weeks, Brian, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=73.42s)]
*  but still when they made the decision, I still found it shocking. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=77.98s)]
*  And I just scratched my head and say, do these guys actually think about what the consequences [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=82.74s)]
*  are of this kind of decision? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=88.14s)]
*  What does it mean for our allies like Ukraine and Taiwan when they see us pulling back on [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=91.1s)]
*  our number one ally in the Middle East, a country we've had the closest relationship [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=97.22s)]
*  with for 75 years, ever since Israel became a state? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=101.74s)]
*  And it comes on the heels of a US-led coalition to help defend Israel against Iranian pressure [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  and ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=112.7s)]
*  I mean, it is a stunning decision. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=115.3s)]
*  And our adversaries, I mean, I think they look at it much like we did with Afghanistan. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=118.42s)]
*  They look at it, the United States pulled out of Afghanistan, walking away from an ally [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=125.58s)]
*  we've been dealing with for 20 years, fighting side by side, and helped surrender the country [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=129.54s)]
*  to the enemy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=134.9s)]
*  And here we are walking away from Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=137.54s)]
*  And our adversaries look at that and they see it as weakness, obviously is what it is. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=141.5s)]
*  But General, if you just boil it down to what's the objective, eradicating Hamas from the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=146.34s)]
*  planet, let alone Gaza, how do you do that and leave 8,000 in Ra'afah? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  You can't. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=154.94s)]
*  So you have to go in. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=155.94s)]
*  So how you go in should be the issue done behind the closed doors by people like you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=157.06s)]
*  that are military experts, not by people that are secretaries of state with no military [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  experience or Jake Sullivan with no military experience or a president of the United States [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  with no military experience. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=171.1s)]
*  And I don't need to tell you that the vice president has no military experience. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=172.5s)]
*  So we don't hear anything from the Defense Department. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=175.82s)]
*  We're hearing it from a politician. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Shouldn't that bother you? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=180.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=182.38s)]
*  Well, it has right from the beginning when they started to wire brush Israel over how [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=183.38s)]
*  they were conducting their military campaign and specifically dealing with Ra'afah itself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=189.38s)]
*  I mean, we should stay out of micromanaging an operational campaign. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=195.74s)]
*  I mean, strategic issues, I understand that completely, but not this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=200.9s)]
*  And it makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=206.62s)]
*  And what's so disappointing is every speech that President Biden makes dealing with the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=208.94s)]
*  issue of the war in Gaza, he should always have a part of that speech that this is an [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=214.82s)]
*  existential threat to the state of Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  We have not seen a threat like this since its inception in 1948. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=223.08s)]
*  Iran has a ring of fire and operationalizes proxies around Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=228.5s)]
*  And they're trying to destroy the state of Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=233.14s)]
*  And we should be doing everything we can to help protect and prevent that from happening. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=236.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=241.38s)]
*  And can I just get a line from you? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=242.38s)]
*  Are you concerned that Hungary and China have signed a strategic cooperation agreement? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=243.38s)]
*  Well, I'm not concerned about the agreement so much as look at the reality is that three [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=248.02s)]
*  quarters of all the investment that goes into Hungary comes from China. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=256.38s)]
*  The president of Hungary, Orban, he's been in power since 2010. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  He's a national populist. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=266.62s)]
*  He has closer relations with China than he does with his mainstream EU and NATO partners. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=269.98s)]
*  He's been troublesome for some time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=276.42s)]
*  President Xi is there taking advantage of it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=280.38s)]
*  He's going to set up an electric vehicle plant. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=282.74s)]
*  They've already got lithium battery plants. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=286.3s)]
*  They're doing railway for him, civilian infrastructure, and also potential nuclear infrastructure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=288.5s)]
*  This is a foothold that Xi wants in the EU. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=294.26s)]
*  He's got real problems with the rest of the EU because his overproduction is flowing into [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=298.7s)]
*  it and they're pushing back on him pretty strongly. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=303.62s)]
*  General Keene, always educational. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  Thanks so much, Perilous Times. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  And always go look at the Institute for Study of War. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pro3fK83E&t=310.54s)]
