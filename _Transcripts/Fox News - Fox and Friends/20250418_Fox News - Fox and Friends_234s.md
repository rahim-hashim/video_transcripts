# Stunning IRS data reveals how much Trump tax cuts have saved Americans
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA)
*  Let's talk about the big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=0.0s)]
*  We know it's about two-thirds of the way there, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=2.4s)]
*  and there's got to be more agreement. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And one of the key things, extending the tax cuts [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=6.12s)]
*  that were put forward in 2017 when Donald Trump was president [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=8.36s)]
*  the first time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=11.96s)]
*  They weren't touched during the Biden years, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=12.92s)]
*  but man, did he benefit. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=14.6s)]
*  The IRS did a study and revealed just how much [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  the Trump tax reform have saved everyday Americans. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=18.8s)]
*  They estimate tens of millions of filers [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=22.36s)]
*  have saved thousands of dollars because of the reform law, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=24.72s)]
*  savings that are now at risk if they fail to extend the tax cuts. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  And of course, they had things like no tax on tips [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=34.12s)]
*  and Social Security. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=36.4s)]
*  But look at these numbers, guys. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=37.6s)]
*  Yeah, the tax cuts expire at the end of the year, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  and these were implemented in Trump's first term. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=41.68s)]
*  So from 2018 to 2024, if you made $50,000 to $75,000, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=45.04s)]
*  you saved $6,300. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=50.2s)]
*  If you made $75,000 to $100,000, you saved $8,300. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=51.68s)]
*  If you made $100,000 to $200,000, you saved $13,500. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  So that money goes into the economy in theory. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  But don't you think releasing data like this [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=62.4s)]
*  goes against everything with the mainstream media, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=65.12s)]
*  as well as a lot of the progressives are saying, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=68.16s)]
*  which is the tax cut was only for the rich? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=70.6s)]
*  When you look at the numbers, that's just not true. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  And the American people felt that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=76.44s)]
*  One of the things that I was looking forward to so much [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  was the decrease in the corporate tax rate, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=80.36s)]
*  because you want to demand. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=82.28s)]
*  You don't want to demand that companies come back. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=84.6s)]
*  We don't do that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=86.24s)]
*  But we want to make it a place where you can tell [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  your shareholders it's in our interest to bring our country [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  back manufacturing here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=92.44s)]
*  Now for tariffs, and number two, because it's now at 21%, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  and it was the highest, now it's right in the middle. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=97.44s)]
*  He wants to drop it to 15% to incentivize people coming back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=100.08s)]
*  But why does Ireland have so many pharmaceuticals? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=103.6s)]
*  They knocked it down to virtually zero. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=106.24s)]
*  So now it makes sense to bring your company to Ireland. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=108.36s)]
*  And actually, I was listening to Rob Lowe the other day. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  They shoot his show, The Floor, in Ireland, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=114.4s)]
*  because there's so many tax breaks to bring companies there [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=117.64s)]
*  and to bring production there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=121.2s)]
*  And this goes to the point that you were making as well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=123.76s)]
*  But then the pandemic, and it stopped everything. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  But there's also some talk on the Capitol. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=129.44s)]
*  And I hope the Republicans don't get behind this, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=131.0s)]
*  of not giving the corporate tax rate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=133.32s)]
*  quite a cut, this go around. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  So some people in the administration [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=137.52s)]
*  have said that's not true, that this is the early stages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=139.24s)]
*  But that can't happen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=141.96s)]
*  There was a campaign promise that everybody was, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=142.88s)]
*  including the businesses, and you've [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=145.72s)]
*  got to balance it out with these tariffs as well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=147.48s)]
*  Some of these companies are going [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=149.32s)]
*  to be hit hard in these first couple of years. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=150.62s)]
*  You've got to give them a break. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  And some of these states give breaks to companies. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Hey, you come to my state. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=156.32s)]
*  Happens all the time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=158.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=158.92s)]
*  No taxes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=160.16s)]
*  Or if you come to my state, fewer taxes than most companies, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=161.0s)]
*  to try to get these big businesses [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=164.76s)]
*  to move into their areas. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=166.24s)]
*  That's why certain people, even network anchors, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=168.12s)]
*  move to Florida. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=171.12s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=172.2s)]
*  The zero tax rate. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't know anybody in particular. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  But I'm just saying generically. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=176.16s)]
*  All of primetime? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=179.16s)]
*  Every single person on the rundown, except for Jesse. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=179.76s)]
*  And he can't because he has the five. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  Also, but theoretically, we want to use it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  But I would say this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  The shortstop, it used to be a shortstop of the Yankees. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  Goes by the name Derek Jeter. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=189.72s)]
*  He would not have his residence in New York. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  Even though he's making $20 million, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=193.56s)]
*  he's had that principle. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=195.28s)]
*  I don't want you just taking 2 thirds of my money. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=196.64s)]
*  Like Letitia James. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  Her residence is in Virginia. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, she lives in Virginia. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=201.32s)]
*  It works out better. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=202.2s)]
*  She married her dad and then got those legal forms. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=203.12s)]
*  Remember that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=206.16s)]
*  But it's OK. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=207.0s)]
*  It's going to be up and up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=208.0s)]
*  Letitia James, yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=209.48s)]
*  And she's having a fundraiser, $18,000 a plate, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=210.48s)]
*  for her legal fees now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=213.32s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=214.44s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=215.32s)]
*  Only a thalaneer. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=216.4s)]
*  We're doing the weave. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  We're doing the president of the weave. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=218.48s)]
*  We're bringing it back and forth. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=219.68s)]
*  Whatever happens. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=220.72s)]
*  Now let's bring it back to some headlines. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Compelling analysis. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmBssJQLkuA&t=231.32s)]
