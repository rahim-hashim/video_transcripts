# Gang member arrested by ICE as Homan issues warning to blue city
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do)
*  A 21-year-old Brazilian gang member in the U.S. illegally, of course, smiling as he gets [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=0.0s)]
*  arrested by ICE. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=5.68s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=6.68s)]
*  After local officials ignored an immigration detainer when he was convicted of assault [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=7.68s)]
*  last year, border guard Tom Homan is vowing to take on Boston's sanctuary city policies. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=11.36s)]
*  I'm coming to Boston. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=17.6s)]
*  I'm bringing hell with me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=18.6s)]
*  Nine child rapists that were in jail in Massachusetts were, rather than honoring an ICE detainer, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=22.6s)]
*  released them back into the street. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=32.28s)]
*  You're not a police commissioner. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=35.92s)]
*  Take that badge off your chest, put it in a desk drawer, because you became a politician, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=37.64s)]
*  you forgot what it's like to be a cop. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=42.64s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=45.24s)]
*  Former Bristol County, Massachusetts, sheriff's Thomas Hodson joins us now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=46.24s)]
*  Sheriff, what's your response to Tom Homan's frustration there? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=50.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, good morning, Brian, and thanks for having me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=54.92s)]
*  Look, Tom Homan, I worked with Tom Homan over the years, and look, he's absolutely correct. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=58.24s)]
*  When you have a police commissioner saying he's going to double down and not cooperate [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  with ICE, what message do you think they're sending to all these criminally illegal aliens? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=68.56s)]
*  Come to Boston. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  This is a place where we're going to kind of give you cover. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=75.08000000000001s)]
*  We're not going to go out of our way to cooperate with ICE. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  You have a better shot of continuing to victimize people in our communities, push your drugs, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=81.08s)]
*  commit your rapes, and do all the things that you're doing, because we're just not going [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=85.56s)]
*  to cooperate with them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=89.6s)]
*  That's completely outrageous. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Every chief, every sheriff, every police commissioner in this nation ought to be cooperating with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=92.84s)]
*  one another, sharing our resources, collaborating on our efforts to keep our community safe. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=98.4s)]
*  That's how we maximize our potential to do our jobs. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=105.4s)]
*  Here's the thing, Tom, from his perspective, let's say you're the most law and order person, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=109.12s)]
*  but you're in a sanctuary city, and they say you can't cooperate with ICE. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  If you do, you lose your job. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Number one, you probably won't take the job, but number two, if you did work your whole [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=118.64s)]
*  career to get to that spot, what do you do at that point? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=122.12s)]
*  Look, I was a sheriff for 25 years here, and I was doing immigration detention for almost [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  that entire 25 years, including 287G. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  I never worried about whether or not I was going to get elected or not, because I swore [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=135.16s)]
*  the oath to uphold the laws and to do the job that the people expected me to do to keep [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  them safe and our neighborhoods safe. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=146.16s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=148.88s)]
*  If you're going to put your job above your public safety, Tom Homan's exactly right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=149.88s)]
*  You're not really a cop. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=154.24s)]
*  You're somebody that's more interested in satisfying the political agendas of the governor [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  of Massachusetts, Mayor Wu of Boston, who are more interested in their political agendas [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=161.36s)]
*  than they are their responsibilities to the people of this state. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  I want you to read this tweet. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=170.28s)]
*  I think I know where you stand. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=171.52s)]
*  This Boston official responded to Tom Homan's threat to the Jews heard. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=173.0s)]
*  The name is Sharon Durkin. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  Laughable that someone who spent their career policing a small, a town smaller than a Fenway [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Park crowd thinks they can lecture Boston on public safety. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Senator Michael Cox serves with distinction and earns trust with integrity. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=187.8s)]
*  Tom Homan should know we don't scare easy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Another official saying we will meet you with hell too. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=194.26000000000002s)]
*  Does he understand how long he's been a federal, a federal official, Tom Homan? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=197.84s)]
*  Maybe he started in a small town, but what does one thing have to do with the other? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  It has nothing to do with it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Tell people in any small community that they are not going to be safe. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=212.28s)]
*  It doesn't much matter what size your community is or what position you came from in what [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=218.0s)]
*  area of population. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=223.6s)]
*  The bottom line is, what is your ultimate responsibility to the people when you take [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=225.08s)]
*  the oath of public safety to uphold the laws of this nation? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=229.52s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=233.4s)]
*  And Tom Homan's right on the money. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=234.4s)]
*  He's doing exactly what the people of this nation want, the people of Massachusetts want. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=236.24s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=240.16s)]
*  This commissioner and this mayor and this governor better get ready because Tom Homan [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=241.28s)]
*  is a man who is a man of his word, who has the background, is going to do the job to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=247.24s)]
*  keep this state safe. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=251.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=253.0s)]
*  And if you're going to get in his way, he's going to put you under arrest. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=254.0s)]
*  I don't care who you are. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=255.92s)]
*  And that's he made that clear before he got the job. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=257.04s)]
*  When he was named, he said, I have a plan for those city officials that are going to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=259.52s)]
*  stand in my way. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=263.56s)]
*  And we know that Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and of course, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=264.56s)]
*  Sheriff, thanks so much. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  Great to have your perspective. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Brian. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8I3cNl2Do&t=274.68s)]
