# 'View' host admits Kamala Harris flubbed 'layup' question: 'It wasn't a gotcha question'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk)
*  But one show we've been talking about for years is the view. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, so Sonny Haas, remember she said, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=3.64s)]
*  what would you do differently, Kamala Harris? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=5.96s)]
*  And Kamala said, you know, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=8.6s)]
*  I don't think I'd do anything differently. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=10.72s)]
*  Well, Sonny was asked about that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=12.16s)]
*  And I think the first soundbite that we're gonna play [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  is Sonny, okay, just one soundbite. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=17.68s)]
*  This is Sonny being asked about it on a podcast. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=23.22s)]
*  I followed up because I was surprised at the answer. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  Look, I think it wasn't so much about the question, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=28.7s)]
*  but it was really more about the answer. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=32.82s)]
*  Not a thing comes to mind. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=34.62s)]
*  Not a thing comes to mind. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=36.08s)]
*  And that's why I followed up with, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=37.58s)]
*  is there anything that you would do differently? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=38.9s)]
*  And the reason I followed up is because, you know, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=41.7s)]
*  that wasn't a gotcha question. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=43.86s)]
*  That was a layup, really. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=45.3s)]
*  It was an important question, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=48.459999999999994s)]
*  and I think one she should have expected. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=49.54s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=52.0s)]
*  I actually thought it was a chance for her [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=53.04s)]
*  to explain to all the people who are saying, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=58.18s)]
*  I want a change agent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=60.38s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=63.06s)]
*  Everyone is talking about this post-mortem [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=63.9s)]
*  and what the Democratic Party should be doing differently. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=65.86s)]
*  And obviously they didn't talk to the working class [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=68.14s)]
*  and didn't talk to minorities communities the way it was. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=70.78s)]
*  But she was a terrible candidate. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party has to come out there [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=77.22s)]
*  and be able to say it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=79.94s)]
*  I know you guys just parachuted her in, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=81.34s)]
*  but there's a reason why she was the first candidate [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=83.42s)]
*  out of the primary back in 2020. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=86.58s)]
*  It's because she was a terrible, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=89.7s)]
*  she should have totally been ready for that question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=90.86s)]
*  And this was a protective question. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=93.9s)]
*  This is her sorority sister that was trying to help her out, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=95.5s)]
*  giving her a layup, and she just did not have an answer. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=98.5s)]
*  But I remember, Lawrence, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  she was asked that question twice that day. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=102.1s)]
*  Two different interviews, and she never, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=104.46s)]
*  even the second time she was asked, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=106.18s)]
*  she didn't change. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  Wasn't it the late night, the show? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=108.38s)]
*  So she had a chance for her staff to say, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=109.86s)]
*  wait, maybe we shouldn't have answered it that way. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  Let's change that for tonight. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=114.5s)]
*  Right, because the number one thing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=116.78s)]
*  that a lot of people said in the polling [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=118.5s)]
*  was we would like to know more about you and your plans. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=121.14s)]
*  And so Sonny goes, I'm gonna ask, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=124.66s)]
*  and this is her chance, and Kamala Harris blew it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=126.42s)]
*  The unfolding scandal I think that's gonna come out [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=129.42s)]
*  is that whole campaign was fake, it's a fraud. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=131.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=135.38s)]
*  And now you find out that all these celebrities [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=136.22s)]
*  that came forward, how much were they compensated? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=137.62s)]
*  And whether it was to a foundation, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=139.9s)]
*  or whether it's a production company, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=141.78s)]
*  $500,000 to Harpo, to Al Sharpton, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=144.34s)]
*  $500,000 to his coalition, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=147.26s)]
*  in order for him, then next you know [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=151.42s)]
*  he's doing an interview. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  Now they say when the FEC sheets come out, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=153.94s)]
*  we're gonna find out if Eminem was paid anything. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=157.18s)]
*  We're gonna find out if Megan Thee Stallion [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=158.94s)]
*  was paid anything. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=160.46s)]
*  So at least you used to think, okay, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=161.34s)]
*  he or she's a celebrity, they're going for this candidate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=163.66s)]
*  Now we're gonna say to yourself, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=167.9s)]
*  how much is that candidate getting paid? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=169.7s)]
*  And I just love the fact that, you know, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=171.62s)]
*  Danny Capaccio goes, I wasn't paid anything. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  He wasn't even offered to me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=175.26s)]
*  Why would you? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=176.26s)]
*  Do you think Brett Favre got money [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=177.3s)]
*  to go out there in Green Bay? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=179.02s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=180.5s)]
*  She can't blame anybody but herself. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=181.34s)]
*  But herself, terrible. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=182.78s)]
*  She was a really bad candidate. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=183.62s)]
*  Or the people who put her in that position. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=184.82s)]
*  They just, she never even had to win a primary. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=186.9s)]
*  And they wasted so much money. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=189.82s)]
*  The story, yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=191.94s)]
*  And Donald Trump did it for a portion of it, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=192.78s)]
*  and they're rebuilding sets and all this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=195.5s)]
*  By the way, have we got a comment from MSNBC or NBC [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=197.54000000000002s)]
*  about them paying Al Sharpton [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=201.26s)]
*  and then her doing an interview after that? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=204.1s)]
*  That has to be some type of media malpractice doing that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  Right, I know. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=208.98s)]
*  And I always look at Al Sharpton as a great journalist. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=209.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  That he posed himself as a commentator. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  I would add one thing, is that she came out, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=217.22s)]
*  and this is the whole thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi had a script. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=223.1s)]
*  You know where her script was? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=224.34s)]
*  Jungle primary at the DNC. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  That was what's gonna save the day. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  She outmaneuvered Nancy Pelosi, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=229.5s)]
*  and as soon as he was done, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=231.94s)]
*  and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=233.74s)]
*  includes or not, the story will be written [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=236.22s)]
*  when she said, no, no, it's gonna be me, it's gonna be her. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=238.54s)]
*  You want me out? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=241.18s)]
*  Well, I'm picking her. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=242.14s)]
*  Deal with it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=243.42s)]
*  And she consolidated the delegates. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=244.26s)]
*  That's what, and Nancy Pelosi said it on the podcast [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=246.34s)]
*  on the New York Times. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=248.74s)]
*  She wasn't really my pick. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=249.86s)]
*  I wanted her to be one of the fishers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=251.18s)]
*  I think a lot of these celebrities, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=252.74s)]
*  a lot of these celebrities just got behind her [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=254.18s)]
*  because they hated Trump so much. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=255.94s)]
*  And they were trying to convince themselves [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=257.22s)]
*  how great she was. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=258.66s)]
*  There were only a few Democrats that were saying, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=259.54s)]
*  she's not a great candidate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  Like David Axelrod would push back. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=262.82000000000005s)]
*  Sometimes James Carver would push back a little bit. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=265.26000000000005s)]
*  You know it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=267.98s)]
*  You're guaranteed a win. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=268.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=269.66s)]
*  The point is, we all knew she wasn't a good candidate. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=270.48s)]
*  We didn't know where she stood on issue. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjVFJeoVEk&t=272.74s)]
