# Hamas is fighting for the future of their ideology: Jon Myers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU)
*  U.S. Marine Corps veteran retired Lieutenant Colonel John Myers joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=0.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, thank you for joining us. When we look at this, I just want to kind of go [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=5.44s)]
*  straight to this hospital. The strategic advantage of Israel taking this hospital, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=9.28s)]
*  if there actually is a Hamas headquarters underneath it, is huge. But the weight of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=14.0s)]
*  civilian casualties and the fact that it is a hospital, obviously Hamas has already taken [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=19.04s)]
*  that into consideration. As a battlefield commander, how difficult would it be to do [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=22.88s)]
*  an operation like this, to take that type of civilian shield to reach an objective? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=28.08s)]
*  Well, thank you. First of all, good morning and happy birthday, Joey. I know it's a couple [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=35.44s)]
*  days late. Yes, sir. Happy birthday to you. As you and I both know, Middle Eastern terror groups, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=39.28s)]
*  as well as even some Middle Eastern militaries, have no qualms using hospitals, schools, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=45.44s)]
*  civilians as a shield for their military operations. If you have any doubt about that, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=51.12s)]
*  just look at October 7th, the regard they paid to kindergartens in Israel during the terrorist [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=54.88s)]
*  attacks. This battle is really an engineering battle. The engineering officers in the IDF are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  really getting the work out on this one with the tunnels and the military headquarters set up under [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=67.28s)]
*  hospitals. It's going to be very difficult to get at those headquarters without causing the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=71.68s)]
*  collateral damage that the Palestinians, not Palestinians, but Hamas is actually hoping for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=78.16s)]
*  to see Palestinians wounded. Do not forget that Hamas launched this with a political objective [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=84.0s)]
*  in mind, and that was to reclaim their victim status. They don't care if they lose civilians. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=89.6s)]
*  They don't care if they even lose their fighters. Really what they're fighting for is the future of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=94.32s)]
*  a Hamas ideology and that next generation of fighters who will grow up to hate Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=98.56s)]
*  Absolutely. You talk about the politics of it. You're running for Congress in Virginia, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=104.32s)]
*  hoping to be one of the decision makers on how we support foreign wars and our own wars. We're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=108.32s)]
*  looking at this. There's a potential for funding to come from Congress to fund Israel's effort in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  this war. I think most Americans absolutely side with Israel, but what is the role of our government [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  and our Department of Defense and our purse when it comes to a war like this that doesn't directly [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=124.08s)]
*  involve us? Yes, so my personal belief system is that we fight in three instances. That's to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=128.48s)]
*  defend our homeland from attack, to defend the homeland of tier one allies, and to stop genocide. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=136.24s)]
*  Israel is the tier one ally. There's no question. The United States government needs to be doing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=143.84s)]
*  everything that they can funding-wise to ensure that they can defend themselves from attack. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  Don't forget they're surrounded on all sides by enemy. It's our key duty to support our ally [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  through the hardest times, and this is definitely the hardest time they've ever faced. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. Lieutenant Colonel, congressional candidate, happy birthday, Marine. Thank you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjLueGzLvmU&t=163.35999999999999s)]
