# 'CRUCIAL WIN': Trump declares victory on border following ruling against Biden
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo)
*  President Trump has declared victory after a federal judge in Texas put a stop to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden administration's effort to sell off the remaining scrap wall that he was going [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=8.88s)]
*  to use for, that obviously the Biden administration completely stalled. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=16.18s)]
*  He writes on True Social and a major crucial win for America and our national security. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=23.32s)]
*  The federal judge in Texas, based on papers we filed just a few days ago, has prohibited [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=27.56s)]
*  the Biden administration from selling any materials designed, designated for the border [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=32.0s)]
*  wall. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  That has been wrecked by Biden and his cronies, and which I'm going to rebuild in order to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  protect our country from violent migrant crime, fentanyl smuggling, sex trafficking, terror [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=43.0s)]
*  attacks and other heinous nation-ending disasters. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=48.2s)]
*  That's good news out of Texas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=53.44s)]
*  Thank you, Texas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=54.76s)]
*  The Biden administration not able to sell off what's remaining of the border wall. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=56.48s)]
*  Yes, Ken Paxton filing that lawsuit, the attorney general of Texas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=60.48s)]
*  Tom Homan was talking about this yesterday on Fox News Live. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=64.08s)]
*  It's disgusting that they're going to take that border wall, which you just said we paid [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=70.12s)]
*  top dollar for, and selling it for pennies on the dollar. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=73.96s)]
*  Now we got to rebuy it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=77.88s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  However, a little bit of good news. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  reached out to me, willing to give us that border wall products back at what they paid [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=82.4s)]
*  for it, the pennies on the dollar, giving us back for the same price. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  I think Ken Paxton, the AG in Texas, took immediate action. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=91.64s)]
*  I know I've been working with Lindsey Graham, taking immediate action. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Right now I think we got them stopped. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=97.44s)]
*  But it's insulting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=99.44s)]
*  They wait four years just before we take control to sell a main piece of our plan to secure [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  that border. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  We had Chuck DeVore on earlier, and I talked to him about the wall. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  One of the things that is so shocking when you go to the border is seeing piles of border [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  wall rusting on one side, people coming across the border, and then massive protection around [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=114.92s)]
*  the detention centers where they're processing it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=121.4s)]
*  I also went to a center that was for unaccompanied minors. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=124.56s)]
*  And I'm telling you, Alcatraz is not more protected than this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=130.78s)]
*  Prisons are not more protected than this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration did everything they could to make sure you did not know anything [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=138.96s)]
*  about the children that were coming across the border, the 300,000 that were missing, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=144.64s)]
*  that remain missing, and the horrors that they went through. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=150.4s)]
*  Rapes, little girls loaded up with birth control pills because the parents who sent them on [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=155.2s)]
*  this journey alone know that they're going to be raped, the number of tragedies that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=161.12s)]
*  happen to them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=166.28s)]
*  And one of the people that has been, I think, a real hero in this, first of all, the group, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=167.64s)]
*  the Texas Department of Public Safety, the DPS, but specifically Lieutenant Olivares, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  who has made it because he's a father and these images have broken his heart and he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=177.6s)]
*  wanted America to know, he has made sure to let us know and show the photos. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=182.04s)]
*  We're the only network that's showing them, basically, of children who have come across [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=187.32s)]
*  the border alone. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  The latest. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=192.76s)]
*  We just got these photos. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  This is a nine-year-old and a five-year-old. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=196.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=198.48s)]
*  They came across alone with the cartels and this often happens. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=199.48s)]
*  The cartels get, for whatever reason, abandon these kids and this is what happens. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=203.0s)]
*  Texas DPS troopers recovered two unaccompanied female children. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=209.44s)]
*  They were abandoned, as I said, and this is just terrible. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=213.48s)]
*  All they had was that piece of paper right there that you see holding them up, and it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  had a phone number and address on it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=221.68s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  That paper. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  It's worth saying, you guys, poverty is no excuse for child abuse. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=226.56s)]
*  What was done to those girls by those parents and certainly by these evil cartels that their [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=230.4s)]
*  parents put them in the hands of is pure evil. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  When you hand over the entire border to the drug cartels and the human smugglers, this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=237.8s)]
*  is what you get. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=242.36s)]
*  One of the strategies that they will sometimes use, of course, is to deploy the people that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=243.52s)]
*  they're smuggling, the humans, the children in this case, a five-year-old and a nine-year-old. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=250.28s)]
*  They'll drop them off in a place in order to divert border patrol over there so that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=254.44s)]
*  they can sneak their more valuable, for them, drugs over in some other spot. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=261.24s)]
*  I think it's so important to show these pictures. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=267.2s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=269.88s)]
*  It's so interesting because most of the political media, they're always looking for heart-rending [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=270.88s)]
*  photographs and they want to show that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=277.76s)]
*  They don't show these, and there's a reason they don't show these, because they care more [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=279.8s)]
*  about protecting the Biden administration and the political left than they do about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=284.42s)]
*  exposing the true human tragedy that is occurring at the border. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=290.22s)]
*  We'll see a change in this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=293.94s)]
*  Tom Homan and Donald Trump have promised to locate as best as they can. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  And they have a record of accomplishing that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=300.66s)]
*  Yes, the 300,000 children that the Biden administration has lost track of. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=302.14s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrTJ2BRbLo&t=305.62s)]
