# Activist group wants to rebrand June’s ‘pride month’ with this controversial twist
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4)
*  Well, tomorrow is June and many people say that it's the start of Pride Month, but one [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=0.0s)]
*  organization wants to change that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Moms for Liberty wants to make June Parental Rights Month, as this year marks the 100th [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=8.64s)]
*  anniversary of Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the landmark Supreme Court decision that enshrined [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=13.84s)]
*  parental rights in America. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring in Wisconsin Ambassador for Moms for Liberty, Scarlett Johnson. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=22.96s)]
*  Good morning, Scarlett. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=27.84s)]
*  So great to have you on Fox and Friends. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=28.84s)]
*  So tell me where this idea came from as far as changing it from Pride Month, making the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=30.96s)]
*  emphasis on parental rights. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=37.18s)]
*  Hi, Rachel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=39.36s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=40.76s)]
*  As you stated, we are celebrating on June 1st the 1925 Supreme Court decision, Pierce [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=42.82s)]
*  v. Society of Sisters, that affirmed the fundamental right of parents to direct their children's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=48.6s)]
*  education. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=54.64s)]
*  And that truth remains the cornerstone of our mission today at Moms for Liberty, and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  especially worthy of honoring a century later, because right now America is in the midst [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=59.96s)]
*  of a fundamental struggle. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=65.7s)]
*  And the question remains, are children the mere creatures of the state or do they belong [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=68.18s)]
*  to parents? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=74.32s)]
*  And when Wisconsin middle school classrooms are adorned with signs like, if your parents [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=75.8s)]
*  aren't affirming of your transgender identity, I'm your mom now, and safe space stickers [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=81.0s)]
*  adorn classrooms, thousands of classrooms across America, implying that parents are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=88.52s)]
*  no longer safe. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=93.88s)]
*  They aren't the safe space. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=95.2s)]
*  The family home is not the safe space. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=96.8s)]
*  That actually government, the state, classrooms, those are the safe space for children. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=99.08s)]
*  We believe that is absolutely wrong. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=105.36s)]
*  Just because a parent doesn't conform with this anti-scientific view that a child can [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=108.2s)]
*  change their biological gender on a whim or their biological sex, that's anti-scientific. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=114.28s)]
*  And we as parents want to protect our children. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=121.36s)]
*  And we do not co-parent with the government. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=124.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, I certainly refuse to co-parent with the government. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  And frankly, that reversal of roles is entirely Marxist, as you well know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Those signs that you talked about are so shocking that those are in school classrooms. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=136.8s)]
*  I just read that there was a Pride kindergarten dance party in Minnesota. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=141.16s)]
*  So these ideas are definitely being infiltrated into our public school system. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=146.52s)]
*  Can you affirm that besides these kinds of signs that you're seeing around our classrooms? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=153.04s)]
*  There is so much that I could affirm. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  We could be here for hours, Rachel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=161.24s)]
*  What I've seen in Wisconsin and what has been replicated across the country, there are very [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=163.88s)]
*  rural areas of Wisconsin where parents are struggling with the transgender ideology and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  what is happening to kids as young as in kindergarten. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=176.96s)]
*  What you're talking about, these transgender parties, they will have struggle sessions [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  with kids. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=187.6s)]
*  They will read books to kids that talk about these controversial topics. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=188.6s)]
*  And then you have states in which they are not even allowing parents the ability to opt [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  their children out of gender ideology in classrooms as young as kindergarten. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=200.56s)]
*  When in Wisconsin, you've got the Wisconsin Department of Instruction providing curricula [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=206.68s)]
*  for transgender three-year-olds. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=212.56s)]
*  Yeah, I have seen that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=215.64s)]
*  We have fought this in my state and parents across the country are fighting it all over [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  We have 130,000 members and we're fighting everywhere. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  We're so grateful for Mons for Liberty, for everything you're doing to expose it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  And for a reminder that just because Donald Trump is in office and trying to fight it [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=231.0s)]
*  at a federal level doesn't mean it's not happening in your state, in your school district, even [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=233.96s)]
*  if you're in rural Wisconsin. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=238.68s)]
*  If it's happening there, it's happening everywhere. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  Scarlett Johnson, you've been such a mama bear fighter in the state of Wisconsin. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=243.72s)]
*  You're well known for that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=247.92s)]
*  We're really grateful to have you on the show. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=248.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=250.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=251.8s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcLYJAOY5I4&t=253.68s)]
