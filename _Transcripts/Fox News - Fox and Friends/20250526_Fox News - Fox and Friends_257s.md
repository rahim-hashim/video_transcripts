# VA Secretary Collins rips media, lawmakers for putting doubt into veterans
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U)
*  All right, another day, another campaign promise kept. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=0.0s)]
*  This one for America's heroes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=3.7s)]
*  The Department of Veteran Affairs cutting the backlog for disability compensation, slashing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=5.4s)]
*  it below 200,000 for the first time since March of 2023. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=10.26s)]
*  VA Secretary Doug Collins joins us now with an update. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=14.08s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, Lars. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  So this was a promise made, a promise kept. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=20.78s)]
*  This is something that you have to review very quickly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=24.62s)]
*  How did you get it done? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=26.86s)]
*  What's the latest on this? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=28.52s)]
*  Well, the latest on this is still going down as we've put focus on it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=29.8s)]
*  I think what really what happens in life is anything else, what gets measured gets done. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=33.6s)]
*  And one of the things that I have told our department is that people look at our disability [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=37.8s)]
*  backlogs, they look at our wait times, because those are the easiest thing, metrics to understand [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=42.2s)]
*  for their members of Congress or just the general public. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=46.04s)]
*  But there's no sense that somebody should have earned benefits and then have to wait [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=48.32s)]
*  months or even sometimes, unfortunately, closer to a year to get an answer on their benefits. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=51.94s)]
*  So we're putting an emphasis on it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=57.36s)]
*  My deputy secretary, Paul Lawrence, has been put in charge of it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=59.44s)]
*  I put him in specifically saying, let's get this backlog down. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=62.6s)]
*  And it's below 200 and keeping on going down. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=65.5s)]
*  You know, Mr. Secretary, I'm always fascinated as some of the attacks on you from the media, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=67.88s)]
*  being how that you are a veteran yourself and you take this very personally. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=73.36s)]
*  What has been your biggest obstacle in this department? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=77.68s)]
*  From what I hear from my sources, it was a complete mess and it's been a mess for years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  I think the biggest obstacle we face is that we've become very comfortable as a department. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=86.68s)]
*  We've got some great employees. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=91.56s)]
*  We've got some great folks who want to help veterans, but they got very much used to just [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=92.56s)]
*  doing it the same way and not being challenged. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=96.84s)]
*  I want to be challenged to them to be the absolute best they can be. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=98.68s)]
*  And I think the biggest thing we face in these first well over 100 days now is just the rumor [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=101.88s)]
*  in innuendo. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  It's amazing how many members of Congress, members of the media would rather take a bad [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  story about the VA, something that they would rather put doubt into our veterans instead [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=111.08s)]
*  of saying, how do we make this better instead of working? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=115.46s)]
*  So the minute I tried to make change into a system that was broken and inherently having [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  problems for 10 years, even the GAO said so. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=122.25999999999999s)]
*  I mean, when you try to make changes and they want to attack you, it tells me they have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  some interest in keeping it the same. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  Well, I have no interest in keeping it the same. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=129.54s)]
*  I only have one interest and that's our veterans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=131.38s)]
*  And there's a lot of veterans that are cheering you on today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=133.38s)]
*  Speaking of our veterans, I want to get your message on this memorial dance. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=136.34s)]
*  We honor and remember the men and women that made the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=139.94s)]
*  Mr. Secretary. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=143.66s)]
*  I do. When you think about it and later today, I'll be at Arlington and last night was at [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=144.98s)]
*  the concert. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  When you think about those who gave that ultimate sacrifice, when you think about the families [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  who are home, I remember being when I was in Iraq and I was having to work and we would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=152.7s)]
*  lose folks in the hospital and send them home. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=156.5s)]
*  What I was thinking about was the families who are now without. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=159.38s)]
*  So today on this memorial day, not only do we remember those who gave that last full [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=162.66s)]
*  measure of devotion, but remember today as you go about your life that there are some [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=165.9s)]
*  who are still looking at an empty chair, they're looking at a visit or someone that they would [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=169.66s)]
*  pick up the phone and talk to that they no longer can. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=173.78s)]
*  It's about those who gave that sacrifice that we remember today because our country is built [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  on the shoulders of those who gave for us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=180.58s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, we don't want their deaths to be in vain. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you get the impression? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=186.86s)]
*  And I went out with some of my friends last night that we're back, that there's this spirit [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=188.34s)]
*  now in the country as we honor these men and women, that that it's not in vain anymore, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=193.9s)]
*  that we got a commander chief, a sec diff that is prepared if these enemies decide they're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=199.18s)]
*  going to attack us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=204.06s)]
*  Yeah, we do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=205.5s)]
*  I mean, with President Trump, I mean, it goes from the veterans who served when he told [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=206.5s)]
*  me his only instructions to me were Doug, take care of our veterans, to every day when [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=210.02s)]
*  he stands up for the world and says, look, you will not be the ones who will push us [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=213.78s)]
*  around. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  We're not going to be the punching bag of the world. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  We're going to stand up for what is right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=220.86s)]
*  We're not going to intervene where we don't need to be, but we're also going to show strength [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  to the world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=225.34s)]
*  When you couple that with my friend over at Pete, at Secretary of Defense, we're putting [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=226.5s)]
*  back that warrior ethos. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=230.22s)]
*  We're putting back that spirit of our military that has one job and one job only, and that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=232.1s)]
*  is protect our country and stand for the freedoms that it has. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=235.94s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for joining the program this morning and giving us an [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=239.38s)]
*  update on what's happening, because I tell you, there's a lot of veterans this morning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  They may have not paid the ultimate sacrifice, but they came back with a lot of wounds and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=248.3s)]
*  they need that help. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=251.94s)]
*  And you're getting it for them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=252.94s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljjWvw9Tx5U&t=254.2s)]
