# Expert rails against TSA for ‘abysmal performance’ after stowaway situation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno)
*  An unidentified stowaway boarding a Delta flight from Seattle to Honolulu on Christmas Eve. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=0.0s)]
*  As officials say, the suspect passed by TSA without a boarding pass. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=5.8s)]
*  This comes less than a month after a Russian national stowaway boarded a Delta plane headed to Paris from New York City. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=10.68s)]
*  Executive Director of the Air Marshall National Council, Sonya Lebosco joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=17.88s)]
*  Sonya, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=23.68s)]
*  You know, this is just absolutely maddening. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=26.28s)]
*  When you think about what regular, normal people go through to get on a plane, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  and then you look around and somebody manages to get on a plane without a boarding pass. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=35.32s)]
*  I mean, Charlie, if this is not the most business performance of TSA, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=42.96s)]
*  every time that we turn around, we're spending billions of dollars on these upgraded security systems for TSA. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=47.2s)]
*  Each year we hear we need more and more in our budget for electronics, more enhanced technology. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=54.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Charlie, think about this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=60.88s)]
*  You go to the ticket counter, you show your ID and a boarding pass, two things that you have to have to get through security. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  If one of those things are missing, you're not allowed to get through. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=70.68s)]
*  So I don't know what TSA is going to do to try to increase their protocols or security protocols. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=73.6s)]
*  When someone doesn't have a boarding pass, it's pretty simple. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=78.8s)]
*  They shouldn't get through security. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=81.88s)]
*  It does seem like it's more of a common sense problem, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  because like you say, they have all the whistles and gadgets that they need, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=87.8s)]
*  but we're still taking off our shoes because of something that happened 15 years ago. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=91.44s)]
*  It does seem like maybe somebody isn't just sort of looking at this from a common sense standpoint and saying, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=96.8s)]
*  well, this is how we could make this... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=102.64s)]
*  I mean, the one benefit of spending so much time in lines going through the airport is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=104.28s)]
*  you get to think of all kinds of ways you could make it more efficient. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=108.92s)]
*  Well, and Charlie, think about it. It wasn't that long ago either. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=113.44s)]
*  We had an incident where there was a body found in the wheel well and a flight going to Maui. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  So how are these individuals getting number one on the tarmac through all the security protocols and procedures that TSA says [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=121.2s)]
*  they have these 11 or 12 layers of security, when in reality, they need to slow down and make sure people have a boarding pass before they get on a plane? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=127.72s)]
*  And let's face it, those were two security checkpoints that failed, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=135.4s)]
*  with someone entering the airport security and then actually boarding the aircraft. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=138.56s)]
*  Sonia Lobosco, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=143.84s)]
*  Thanks, Charlie. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4jNcyd_Uno&t=146.96s)]
