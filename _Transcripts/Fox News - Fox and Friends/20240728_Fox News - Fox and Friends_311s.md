# This all comes back to Iran: Former State Department spokesperson
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA)
*  And a Fox News alert, Israel heading back against Hezbollah in Lebanon after the Iranian-backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=0.0s)]
*  terrorist group fired rockets at an Israeli playground, killing 12 children. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=7.68s)]
*  It was the deadliest attack since October 7th. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=12.56s)]
*  Former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortegas joins us right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=16.44s)]
*  Morgan, it's good to see you, albeit with this horrible news that we are still digesting. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=19.92s)]
*  And we saw some of these response attacks from the Israelis overnight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  That's just the beginning, probably, right? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=29.16s)]
*  Yes, certainly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=33.32s)]
*  This has been the type of thing that we have all been worried about and warning about for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=34.8s)]
*  months is what would happen in Israel's north. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=38.92s)]
*  So we know in the south, that's where Hamas is, and they perpetrated the massacre on October [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=41.92s)]
*  7th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=47.64s)]
*  But unfortunately in the north, you also have about 80,000 Israelis that have been displaced [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=48.64s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=53.96s)]
*  That's 10 months later, Guy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=55.96s)]
*  That's principally because of the things like this that Hezbollah does. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=57.72s)]
*  Now, Hezbollah, of course, is yet another Iranian proxy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=62.08s)]
*  It's another terror group that Iran funds, trains, and equips in the region. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=66.4s)]
*  And unfortunately, the military weaponry, the rockets used to kill these children was, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=70.72s)]
*  of course, made in Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=76.44s)]
*  So it all comes back to the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=78.08s)]
*  And again, not only do you have them killing these children and wounding others, you have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=81.16s)]
*  about 80,000 Israelis who are living in hotels. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=85.68s)]
*  They're internally displaced within their own country, and they can't get home. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  And they're displaced, and this type of attack is made easier, if I'm not mistaken, Morgan, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=93.0s)]
*  because the international community isn't even enforcing against Hezbollah previous [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  rules that were set out after the last time Hezbollah was acting this way. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  So Israel and Hezbollah had a war in 2006. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=108.36000000000001s)]
*  And actually, at the United Nations, there was a Security Council resolution, and Hezbollah [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=111.44s)]
*  was supposed to completely disarm. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=117.56s)]
*  Spoiler alert for our audience, that did not happen over the past 18 years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=119.92s)]
*  In fact, they have a very sophisticated ballistic missile arsenal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=124.0s)]
*  All of their military hardware is, again, supplied by Iran. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=129.12s)]
*  We know that Iran has perfected their killer drones. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=131.92s)]
*  They've given them to Russia to use against Ukrainian civilians. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  And so not only are they much more equipped from a military perspective, from military [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=139.76s)]
*  hardware, from ballistic missiles, their army is much bigger. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=143.72s)]
*  They have the capability, Guy Benson, Hezbollah does, to overwhelm Iron Dome and Israeli Defense [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=147.2s)]
*  Forces. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=152.92s)]
*  Now, why does all of this matter to the United States? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=153.92s)]
*  Well, despite what President Biden said earlier this week, how he claimed our military wasn't [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=156.16s)]
*  at war, our U.S. Navy guy has seen more action in the Red Sea than any other time since World [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=161.32s)]
*  War II. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=167.64s)]
*  Our U.S. Navy is using something called T-Lams to stop the Houthis, yet another Iranian-backed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=168.76s)]
*  terror group, from attacking them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=174.32s)]
*  They're using more T-Lams. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=176.84s)]
*  They're using like a year's worth of T-Lams to defend U.S. Navy ships, merchant vessels [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=177.84s)]
*  from the United States and other Western countries. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=184.64s)]
*  So when you look at what's actually going on in the Middle East, it is a chaotic period [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=187.64s)]
*  of time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=191.54s)]
*  It's even worse than chaos. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=192.88s)]
*  It's all-out war in the Middle East. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=193.98s)]
*  We may not have called it that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=196.04s)]
*  Congress may not have called it that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=197.44s)]
*  But we are at war every single day. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=199.52s)]
*  And if Lebanon, if Hezbollah, which is in Lebanon, and Israel get into a full war because [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=201.28s)]
*  of what Hezbollah did yesterday, it's almost impossible for the U.S. not to get dragged [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=207.34s)]
*  in this because we're already dragged into it, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  We're already getting hit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=214.68s)]
*  We're already getting aimed at by the Houthis. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=215.68s)]
*  You know, Morgan, when we look at American politics, you have the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=218.32s)]
*  They have enriched the Iranian regime, which has empowered them to engage in this type [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=223.6s)]
*  of terrorism support on multiple fronts against Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=228.2s)]
*  Then there's been quite a bit of daylight between Israel and the United States during [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  the Gaza war started by Hamas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  That's a tough combination, I think, to defend from an American perspective, given what Israel [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=238.0s)]
*  faces in terms of this threat. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=243.48s)]
*  Yeah, you can put a different face name on it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=245.72s)]
*  But ultimately, this is the policy towards the Middle East that Barack Obama and his [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=251.18s)]
*  administration started in their second term. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=255.74s)]
*  This was in the first term of Obama. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=259.18s)]
*  By the way, I was in the Middle East as his treasury attache in the first Obama term. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  They had continued the Bush administration sanctions. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=266.26s)]
*  They were still tough on Iran. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=268.72s)]
*  And the second term, that completely changed when they decided to negotiate the JCPOA, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  the failed Iran nuclear deal that President Trump rightly withdrew from. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=275.5s)]
*  And what we've seen is them just go back to those Obama policies that enrich Iran, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=280.1s)]
*  that are rich in terror groups around the Middle East, and that get Americans killed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=284.38s)]
*  That's the most important point on all of this, Guy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  Americans are getting killed, shot at, and attacked by all of Iran's terror proxies throughout [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=290.86s)]
*  the entire region. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  Morgan Ertegas, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLmLz_6MxA&t=297.74s)]
