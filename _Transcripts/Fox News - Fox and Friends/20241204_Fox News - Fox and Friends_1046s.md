# Pete Hegseth's mother sets record straight: 'He's a warrior'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8)
*  All right, former Fox and Friends weekend co-host Pete Hegseth has been at the center [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=0.0s)]
*  of an intense media scrutiny ever since being named Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=5.04s)]
*  of Defense. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=10.28s)]
*  Pete has faced several accusations, including abuse, sexual assault, and more. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=11.28s)]
*  There was also a leaked email from Pete's mom from 2018 that was published in the New [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=16.86s)]
*  York Times, and in it, she was critical of his past relationships with women. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=22.76s)]
*  Pete's mother, Penelope Hegseth, joins us live on the set to tell us what she wanted [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=28.52s)]
*  to tell us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=33.8s)]
*  You called us yesterday and you said you wanted to come on. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=34.8s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=36.76s)]
*  I said I would do anything for my son. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=37.76s)]
*  I completely get this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=39.6s)]
*  You never in a million years thought you would be doing this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=43.28s)]
*  No. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Because you didn't realize that this email you wrote in 2018, somebody leaked it to the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  New York Times. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=53.32s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=54.32s)]
*  And they printed it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=55.32s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=56.32s)]
*  I'm going to read part of it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=57.32s)]
*  This is to Pete during the 2018 divorce. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=58.92s)]
*  You say, I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, and sleeps around. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=63.28s)]
*  And you go on and say, you are that man and have been for years. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=68.56s)]
*  And as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is a sad, sad truth. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=72.32s)]
*  You say, we still love you, but we are broken by your behavior and your lack of character. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=77.76s)]
*  When you wrote that, what's the backstory? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=84.72s)]
*  What was going on that made you so angry you wanted to write that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=87.5s)]
*  Well, I will tell that story in a moment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=92.14s)]
*  But let me make two statements first. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=94.62s)]
*  And one is to President Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=97.42s)]
*  And I want to say thank you for your belief in my son. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=100.06s)]
*  We all believe in him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  We really believe that he is not that man he was seven years ago. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=105.7s)]
*  I'm not that mother. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  And I hope people will hear that story today and the truth of that story. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=112.74s)]
*  So the other thing I want to say is I am here to tell the truth, to tell the truth to the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=117.78s)]
*  American people and tell the truth to the senators on the Hill, especially our female [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=123.38s)]
*  senators. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=129.98s)]
*  I really hope that you will not listen to the media and that you will listen to Pete. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=130.98s)]
*  Well, and you're here to tell us because you are in the news now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=138.42s)]
*  So why did you write that email? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=142.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=144.74s)]
*  What was going on? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=145.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=146.74s)]
*  Let's go back seven years, which if we all went back seven years, we would see that maybe [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=147.74s)]
*  we were not the people we are today. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=152.86s)]
*  But they were going through, Pete and his wife at the time were going through a very [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=155.58s)]
*  difficult divorce. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=160.18s)]
*  It was a very emotional time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=161.18s)]
*  And I'm sure many of you across the country understand how difficult divorce is on a family. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=163.62s)]
*  There's emotions. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=170.46s)]
*  We say things and I wrote that in haste. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=172.44s)]
*  I wrote that with deep emotions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=176.32s)]
*  I wrote that as a parent. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=179.56s)]
*  And about two hours later, I should, my husband tells me I should think through things a little [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=182.24s)]
*  bit more. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=187.0s)]
*  But Pete and I are both very passionate people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=188.0s)]
*  I wrote that out of love. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=191.28s)]
*  And about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology email, but nobody's seen that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=193.72s)]
*  So it was a difficult time. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=200.12s)]
*  I want to say something about the media. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  And part of today is to discredit the media and how they operate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=205.8s)]
*  When they contact you, I let a few phone calls go, but then they call you and say they threaten [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=212.08s)]
*  you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  That's the first thing they do. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  They say unless you make a statement, we will publish it as is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=221.0s)]
*  And I think that's a despicable way to treat anyone. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=225.24s)]
*  Threats are dangerous and they're hard on families. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=230.24s)]
*  So to recap, you were angry about what was going on, his behavior during the divorce. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=235.88s)]
*  And so you wrote that email. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=245.0s)]
*  And then, you know, a couple hours later, you apologized and you guys talked and you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=246.12s)]
*  worked it out? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=251.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=252.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=253.4s)]
*  Pete and I are very close today. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=255.04s)]
*  In fact, our whole family is very tight knit. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=256.76s)]
*  But I think that we as parents, we always parent. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=262.08s)]
*  No, I get it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=266.36s)]
*  I mean, and that was seven years ago. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=267.52s)]
*  I want to talk in a minute about who Pete is today. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=270.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=273.8s)]
*  There are, and you wanted to come on to talk a little bit, and you mentioned a moment ago, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=274.8s)]
*  the media scrutiny. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=278.4s)]
*  You know, there are allegations of sexual assault, excessive alcohol use, infidelity, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=279.4s)]
*  financial mismanagement. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  As a parent, that's really hard. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to hear. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, our job as parents are to correct. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  They are to speak truth. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=296.08s)]
*  And I am a passionate person like Pete and sometimes emotional words come out. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't believe any of that is true, any of it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=305.6s)]
*  And I'm here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=309.92s)]
*  I wouldn't be sitting on this in this chair today if I didn't believe that about my son. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=310.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=314.76s)]
*  How's the family holding up? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=315.76s)]
*  Oh, we're OK. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=317.12s)]
*  We have a deep, deep faith, not only in each other, but in God. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=319.64s)]
*  And our friends have been amazing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=324.68s)]
*  The support we've been receiving has been amazing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=326.76s)]
*  So we're trusting in our God and in our faith and in our family. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=330.04s)]
*  What do you say to people who have read the stuff about Pete or heard the stuff about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=338.16s)]
*  Pete? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  You're here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  You said he has changed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=346.04s)]
*  How do you convince people of that? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=347.76s)]
*  OK, well, I start with four things. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  First, I have a very intelligent son. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=352.12s)]
*  I have a leader son. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=355.0s)]
*  I've known that since he was two. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=356.24s)]
*  He went to Princeton and Harvard. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=359.72s)]
*  By the way, he returned the Harvard diploma. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=361.76s)]
*  But I wouldn't let him return the Princeton because I work too hard. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=364.68s)]
*  For that one, that one's going to stay. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=368.96s)]
*  That's on his wall. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=371.64s)]
*  He's written two New York Times bestsellers. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=373.56s)]
*  Who would mother can say that? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=377.4s)]
*  And one of them is about war and defense. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  So he already has a playbook. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=382.16s)]
*  So you talk about experience. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=384.7s)]
*  He's also put his life on the line twice overseas for our country, one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=387.2s)]
*  I'm a very proud Blue Star mom. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  There it is right there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=397.52s)]
*  And he's still a warrior. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=399.56s)]
*  And that's why he's still fighting. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=401.86s)]
*  That's why we're all still fighting because we believe in the good. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=403.12s)]
*  You know, and usually with confirmation hearings and in the process, you just hear from the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=406.2s)]
*  nominee, they go and they visit everybody. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=411.44s)]
*  You were dragged into the story because the New York Times wrote that, you know, they [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=413.64s)]
*  reported on that email that you sent back in 2018. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=419.28s)]
*  But you know, for the most part, and what I've heard you say this morning is you wanted [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=423.12s)]
*  to come on because that was not the whole story. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=427.68s)]
*  No, no. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=430.52s)]
*  And I want people to look at Pete, judge people or understand him for who he is today and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=432.0s)]
*  to disregard the media. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=439.12s)]
*  That was seven years ago. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=441.0s)]
*  And most of it is misinformation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=444.32s)]
*  And the way they threaten you, I think is very hurtful. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=446.88s)]
*  And the person who leaked it, I don't know who that is. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  And I don't think I will need to. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=456.38s)]
*  But Pete is a new person. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=458.48s)]
*  He's redeemed, forgiven, changed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=461.32s)]
*  I think we all are after seven years. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=464.76s)]
*  I believe he's the man for the job. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=467.72s)]
*  I think being a TV news host, I think prepares you for most things in a position like this. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=469.8s)]
*  You're a good communicator. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=477.12s)]
*  You have to think on your feet. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=478.92s)]
*  You take charge. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=480.48s)]
*  So I think everybody should do a year with Fox. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=481.48s)]
*  There you go. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  It's got to be tough as his mother to hear the drip, drip, drip, because every day more [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=486.86s)]
*  stuff comes out. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=491.76s)]
*  It's like you probably hate to turn on your phone because it's like, hey, it's my cousin [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=493.44s)]
*  telling me the latest news about you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=499.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=500.88s)]
*  But I know Pete. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=501.88s)]
*  And the people who know us know Pete. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=502.88s)]
*  And Trump knows Pete. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=504.68s)]
*  And he knows the Pete of today. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=507.08s)]
*  And he knows the Pete who is a good father, a good husband to Jen. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=509.6s)]
*  He's got seven kids. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=514.92s)]
*  He's a wonderful son, wonderful son, and a wonderful son to his brothers and all his [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=516.6s)]
*  friends. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=522.96s)]
*  And I just hope people will get to know who Pete is today, especially our dear female [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=525.0400000000001s)]
*  senators, that you would listen to him. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=531.32s)]
*  Listen with your heart to the truth of Pete. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  And what I heard you say just a moment ago, Penny, was he's a changed man. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=537.88s)]
*  So the man you wrote to in 2018, who you were really mad at. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  As a mom. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=548.6400000000001s)]
*  He is different than that man. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=550.2800000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=552.36s)]
*  I believe that with all my heart. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=553.64s)]
*  And I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't believe he's the man for the job. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you, as you look at what is going on in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=562.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  This is the way it works. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  There are people who want Pete to get the job. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=568.88s)]
*  There are people who don't want Pete to get the job. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=571.84s)]
*  As a mother, that's got to be tough. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=574.32s)]
*  They don't like my son. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=577.28s)]
*  Then you add on these allegations and it's like, OK, it becomes a little more complicated. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=579.24s)]
*  It becomes much more complicated. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  Pete and I are both warriors. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  And we've developed a really tough skin over the years. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=587.92s)]
*  First raising Pete and then going through war, saying goodbye to his son, to war. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  What mom needs to do that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=599.4s)]
*  And then his accomplishments and his qualities as a leader. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=601.04s)]
*  He is strong. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=605.48s)]
*  He is capable. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=606.92s)]
*  I think his experience, I think the people that Trump has picked are not the ones you [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  would expect. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  And I love that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  Given the fact that you have suddenly become part of the story because of the 2018 email [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  you sent Pete, as a parent, do you feel a little guilty? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=621.88s)]
*  Man, I wish I hadn't written that because now I have made a mess. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=626.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, don't you think everyone has regrets as a parent? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=631.88s)]
*  It's not an easy job. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=635.92s)]
*  We've all made mistakes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=637.48s)]
*  We've all. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=639.4s)]
*  And I would challenge anyone who thinks they're qualified to throw the first stone. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=640.84s)]
*  Does it upset you that it has brought so much scrutiny to your family? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's hard. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=652.88s)]
*  I mean, yes, that is hard. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=653.88s)]
*  Because there are people looking, you know, throughout his entire history and whatever [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=655.96s)]
*  that means. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=660.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=661.84s)]
*  But we've been through a lot as a family. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=662.84s)]
*  And our faith has assured us that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=665.88s)]
*  world. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=671.92s)]
*  And no matter what the results, we know that God is for us. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=673.28s)]
*  Our friends are for us. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=679.48s)]
*  Thank you, friends. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=680.64s)]
*  You know who you are out there, Fox and friends too. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=681.92s)]
*  But our dear friends who've been supporting us through prayer. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=684.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=687.6s)]
*  And you did mention Donald Trump. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=688.6s)]
*  You thanked him in the beginning when you made your comments. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=690.34s)]
*  Has Pete heard from Mr. Trump? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=693.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  They talk often. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=696.6800000000001s)]
*  And what's going on between the two of them? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, the other night I heard that everything was good. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=700.36s)]
*  I'm not in that world directly. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=703.2800000000001s)]
*  But I think Trump is a good man and I think he's picked some good nominees. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think the senators need to listen. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=712.6s)]
*  Do you worry, Penny, though, that, you know, Donald Trump's trying to hit the ground running? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=716.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=721.32s)]
*  You know, in less than 50 days. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=722.32s)]
*  And this, the Pete Hex stuff has become a distraction. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=724.4000000000001s)]
*  To a degree. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=730.36s)]
*  But I think it can be overcome. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=732.74s)]
*  I think people need to listen to him, get to know him, not the Pete from seven years [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=735.0s)]
*  ago, but the Pete of today. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  In the confirmation hearings coming up, if Pete continues with this nomination process, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=745.6s)]
*  you might be called. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=752.48s)]
*  Would you testify in front of Congress? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=754.06s)]
*  I don't even answer to that right now, Steve. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=755.76s)]
*  I hadn't thought about that. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=759.24s)]
*  What about the other people involved in the other allegations? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=762.04s)]
*  They too will probably be called to tell their story because you wanted to come on to tell [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=766.52s)]
*  your side of the story, which you have. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=773.08s)]
*  They will probably get that same opportunity. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=775.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=778.68s)]
*  Well, that's up to them. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=779.68s)]
*  I only have so much control. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=782.68s)]
*  But I want to make two final statements. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=784.96s)]
*  I want to thank Fox News, all of you at Fox, from makeup to cameramen to producers to the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=787.52s)]
*  other hosts and how you've grown him as a leader. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=798.04s)]
*  I think everybody should do a year on Fox. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=802.48s)]
*  You learn to be a communicator. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=806.12s)]
*  You learn to take charge. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=807.72s)]
*  Penny, what's something, you know, he worked here until just like a week ago. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=810.28s)]
*  We all know him. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=818.4s)]
*  As his mother, what's one thing about Pete people don't realize? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=819.8s)]
*  That he's got a big heart. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=824.28s)]
*  That he's very smart. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=826.92s)]
*  He is the most faithful patriot of this country. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=831.64s)]
*  He loves his country, loves his country. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=835.64s)]
*  He's fought and almost died for his country. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=839.28s)]
*  He's a good dad. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=843.6s)]
*  He's an amazing son and father. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=845.36s)]
*  That's the Pete I want people to know. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=849.28s)]
*  Then I want to say one more thing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=851.32s)]
*  I said, I believe he's the man for the job. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=853.12s)]
*  But more than that, I believe he's the man for such a time as this. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=855.84s)]
*  At this time, you're on TV explaining your son and his character. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=862.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=867.84s)]
*  Because somebody gave the New York Times that email. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=868.84s)]
*  They did. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=871.84s)]
*  How many people got your email? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=872.84s)]
*  Was it just to Pete? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=874.84s)]
*  You know, I haven't been able to track that like my blind copy or my copy. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=876.84s)]
*  I don't think that's important right now. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=883.32s)]
*  I think what's really important is that the truth be told about that email. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=885.32s)]
*  And that we look at Pete today, not then. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=889.32s)]
*  And I'm here. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=893.32s)]
*  You say it's important that people know the truth. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=896.32s)]
*  Is there some part of that story that has been depicted in the media that is not true? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=899.32s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=904.32s)]
*  Of course. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=905.32s)]
*  Which part? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=906.32s)]
*  You know, he's... [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=907.32s)]
*  I don't want to use the words, but he doesn't misuse women. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=909.32s)]
*  No. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's been through some difficult things. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to list them by name, but I would just say that some of those attachments [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  or descriptions are just not true, especially anymore. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  It sounds like you're a little disillusioned. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  Have you lost trust in how things happen? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=931.8000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  Listen, I came to take on New York City, to take on the New York Times, to be a mother [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  a strong mother, a fighter. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=942.28s)]
*  What's your message to the New York Times? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=944.28s)]
*  I would say I don't think the way you operate is... [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=946.28s)]
*  It feels almost criminal when reporters call you and threaten you. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=950.28s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people know that's the way they operate. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=954.28s)]
*  And they are in it for the commission, for the money. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=957.28s)]
*  And they don't care who they hurt, families, children. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=962.28s)]
*  And I just, I don't believe that that is the right way to do things. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=967.76s)]
*  Do you think that's just the way they try to get the story? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=973.76s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=976.76s)]
*  It's their job. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=977.76s)]
*  But I can take the opposite view. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=978.76s)]
*  I can take the high road. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=981.76s)]
*  I can take the belief in good and the good in people. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=983.76s)]
*  And will we be persecuted? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=987.76s)]
*  Will we suffer in life? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=990.76s)]
*  Yeah, sure, we will. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=992.76s)]
*  But I know in whom I believe. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=994.76s)]
*  I believe in God, I believe in Pete. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=997.24s)]
*  I believe in my family, my husband. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=999.24s)]
*  Of 48 years, hi honey. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=1001.24s)]
*  He is in Tennessee taking care of Pete's four children. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=1003.24s)]
*  All the 21 chickens, the two horses, and beavers that seem to be at work at the pond. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=1008.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=1016.24s)]
*  Penny Hegseth, thank you very much for stopping by to tell us about your son. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4o3k0T10F8&t=1018.24s)]
