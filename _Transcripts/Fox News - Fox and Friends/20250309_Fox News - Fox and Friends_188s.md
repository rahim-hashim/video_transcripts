# Hurt: This is as fake as Gavin Newsom's hair gel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw)
*  Well, a quote that I don't think aged very well, even though it was yesterday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=0.0s)]
*  was a quote from Joe Biden. We'll put that in there, quotes, because I don't think he actually [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=4.64s)]
*  wrote this. He said on X, like so many of you, I'm celebrating the incredible women [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=8.4s)]
*  in my life today. International Women's Day is a time to recognize the achievements [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=12.64s)]
*  of women and girls everywhere and recommit our efforts to advance dignity, opportunity, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=16.8s)]
*  and equality for all. When women and girls succeed, communities, economies, and democracies [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=22.64s)]
*  succeed. Wow. This is what I love about elections. Once the election is over and everybody realizes it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=28.0s)]
*  and even like Democrats are like, wait, do we really support all this stuff? Actually, no, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=33.44s)]
*  we don't. Didn't pan out very well. And he, you know, whoever wrote that, I don't know, he [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=37.92s)]
*  didn't write it. They wrote it like we haven't been having the debate we've been having in this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=42.72s)]
*  country for years now. Just focus on this. Nothing to see over here. It's a jazz hand. We're going to pretend, yeah, jazz hands. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  We're just going to pretend like everything is just sort of normal and here's my ex post or whatever [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=55.04s)]
*  on International Women's Day. Meanwhile, you've got women around the country fighting like crazy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=60.8s)]
*  to try to do the things he wrote about in there, like actual equality and opportunity. And all the Democrats [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=66.8s)]
*  voting against the bill that would have actually meant equality for women in sports and keeping men [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=71.52s)]
*  out of them, but I digress. And then you have Gavin Newsom who I think, you know, I don't know, we'll [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=77.12s)]
*  see how successful this is, but you know, he's launched this podcast. His whole point of the podcast [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=83.6s)]
*  is to launder himself, to launder all of his wacko crazy views because he wants to to run for president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=89.52s)]
*  And I think we have a clip from that where he has done an about face on all of his views sort of about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=96.24s)]
*  women in sports. You right now should come out and be like, you know what, the young man who's about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=103.28s)]
*  to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that's that that shouldn't happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=109.92s)]
*  You as the governor should step out and say no. No, and I appreciate. And like, would you do [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=114.8s)]
*  something like that? Would you say no men in female sports? Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=118.88s)]
*  I completely agree with you on that. So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that. So he OK, so he [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=122.56s)]
*  asked him, would you do anything about that? Like action, right? And what did Newsom say? Well, it's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=128.0s)]
*  an unfairness thing, you know, like so he kind of he turns to the character is his new [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=135.04s)]
*  characterization of it. But he definitely dodges the main question. Would you do anything? You're [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=140.72s)]
*  the governor. You could do something about it. Will you do something about it? And the answer is no. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=145.04s)]
*  Just say that that was the law in California that this is just allowing us that he promulgated. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=148.72s)]
*  And also in terms of fairness, that's what everybody's been talking about. That's been [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  the argument. Welcome to the party. Right. Exactly. We've been talking about it for a while. We don't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=160.0s)]
*  think he's really come to the party, I think is what we're saying. It's fake. It's all fake. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=163.44s)]
*  It says fake is his hair gel. OK, turning real, actually, it's very real. The hair gel is real, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=167.6s)]
*  but his hair doesn't really work. It's like a helmet. Exactly. OK. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11kYnsmmlHw&t=173.6s)]
