# This would be 'catastrophic,' GOP rep warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0)
*  The Senate passing a bill to stop a government shutdown, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=0.0s)]
*  sending it to President Biden's desk [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=4.0s)]
*  after missing the midnight deadline by 37 minutes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=6.16s)]
*  The measure extends government funding into March [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=10.32s)]
*  and includes roughly $100 billion in disaster aid [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=12.88s)]
*  and relief for farmers. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  And that's right, it passed in the Senate [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=16.88s)]
*  in a 85 to 11 vote, 10 Republican senators [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=18.84s)]
*  and one independent Senator Bernie Sanders [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=23.56s)]
*  voted against the bill. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=25.76s)]
*  This coming after it cleared the House [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=27.12s)]
*  when 366 legislators voted yes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=29.18s)]
*  All the lawmakers who voted no were Republican. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=32.22s)]
*  The newly passed 118 page bill does not include [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=35.42s)]
*  many policies that were in the original 1500 page proposal [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=39.58s)]
*  including healthcare provisions, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=43.34s)]
*  restricting investments in China, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=44.94s)]
*  pay raises for lawmakers and suspending the debt ceiling. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  The president-elect reportedly not happy about the bill, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=51.18s)]
*  especially the fact that the spending deal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=54.06s)]
*  does not include suspending the debt ceiling. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=56.5s)]
*  Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson says [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=59.74s)]
*  he spoke with the president-elect. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=61.78s)]
*  I was in constant contact with President Trump [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=64.9s)]
*  throughout this process. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=68.22s)]
*  He knew exactly what we were doing and why, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=69.26s)]
*  and this is a good outcome for the country. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=71.18s)]
*  President Biden has signaled that he will sign [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=75.56s)]
*  the CR bill into law. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=79.02s)]
*  And you know, it's interesting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  because if you were following along with this yesterday, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  it passed it in the House at about 5.30 p.m. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=84.82s)]
*  And then, you know, he goes over to the Senate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=88.5s)]
*  who has to wrestle with it for a couple hours. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=90.1s)]
*  You're probably thinking, oh my gosh, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=91.82s)]
*  President Biden is gonna have to stay up late [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=92.86s)]
*  and sign this thing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=94.74s)]
*  You know, he's gotta watch what's going on [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=95.58s)]
*  in the Senate floor. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  And the functioning of our government depends on this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=98.1s)]
*  Until you find out that the White House [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=102.82s)]
*  released his statement says, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=104.22s)]
*  he'll just sign it in the morning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=105.46s)]
*  Essentially, he's going to bed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=106.78s)]
*  I really don't know how it works. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=108.38s)]
*  I don't think he stood up, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=110.46s)]
*  I don't think he stayed up much later [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  than he normally would. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=114.78s)]
*  And I remember a couple months ago, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=116.18s)]
*  I asked because I asked at the press conference [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=119.02s)]
*  because there was some story out [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=122.7s)]
*  that you're never gonna get him after like 8 p.m. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=123.94s)]
*  doing anything. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=126.7s)]
*  And I remember I asked, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=127.7s)]
*  what happens if there's like an incoming nuke [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=128.9s)]
*  to call the first lady? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=131.02s)]
*  And they said, there is a process [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  for notifying the president when things come up. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't know that a 37 minute government shutdown [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=137.54s)]
*  rises to the level where they're gonna go shake him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=139.78s)]
*  Wake him up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=142.42s)]
*  So he's still got to sign it into law today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=143.26s)]
*  I think what's so fascinating is, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=145.05999999999997s)]
*  as Speaker Johnson is talking about, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  well, I was in contact with the president-elect, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  but Peter and I all this week covered the Mar-a-Lago beat. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=150.22s)]
*  And here we were thinking that this 1500 plus page CR, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=153.7s)]
*  which is exactly what the country had gotten tired of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=158.82s)]
*  and reflected in the election results, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=162.38s)]
*  all of a sudden Trump weighs in, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=164.14s)]
*  puts his finger on the scale, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  and all of a sudden he's not gonna be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  actually sworn in for a month, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  but he's having the greatest impact [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=170.06s)]
*  and shaking Washington up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=172.18s)]
*  What do we get? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  We got a skinny bill that's only over, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  just barely over a hundred pages. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=176.74s)]
*  So let's bring in one of the congressmen [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=177.86s)]
*  who voted yes on this bill to sign it into law, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=179.82s)]
*  Florida Congressman Carlos Jimenez. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=183.22s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=185.3s)]
*  So the original bill was 1547 pages. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  The slimmed down version was 118. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=191.62s)]
*  That's what the president is expected to sign later today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=194.62s)]
*  So how do you feel about what passed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=197.66s)]
*  through the House and Senate yesterday? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=200.02s)]
*  What did Republicans achieve and accomplish [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  in trying to get this into a slimmer version [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  that will go into law later today? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=209.14s)]
*  Well, we have ordered a shutdown of the federal government [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=213.04s)]
*  that wastes money, believe it or not. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=215.98s)]
*  When we shut down the government, it wastes money. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=218.42s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  Because we give federal workers basically a paid vacation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=221.42s)]
*  When they come back, they get their payback. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=225.5s)]
*  And then also on terms of our national security, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=228.34s)]
*  all production stops. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=232.34s)]
*  So our fighter jets, submarines, et cetera, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=233.18s)]
*  all that stuff that's being produced right now [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=235.74s)]
*  to help keep America safe and secure, that stops. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=237.9s)]
*  And then we have to restart those production lines, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=240.86s)]
*  which again, costs more money. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=243.78s)]
*  And so shutting the government down is never a good idea. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  And so what we accomplished, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=248.18s)]
*  we averted a shutdown of the government. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=249.9s)]
*  Congressman, Speaker Johnson did something last night [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=252.02s)]
*  that doomed Kevin McCarthy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=256.94s)]
*  He put forward a bill to fund the government [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=259.14s)]
*  that needed a lot of Democratic support. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=262.46s)]
*  In two weeks, when you guys all go to vote on a new speaker, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  is Speaker Johnson a goner? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=274.58s)]
*  I'm gonna be supporting Mike Johnson. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=275.41999999999996s)]
*  Look, these are the cards that are dealt. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=277.06s)]
*  If we had sufficient Republicans to pass some bills, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=279.86s)]
*  we wouldn't need any Democrats, unfortunately. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=285.3s)]
*  We can't seem to agree with each other. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=288.38s)]
*  We had like 30 Republicans that did not vote for this bill. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=290.26s)]
*  We only have like a two or three seat majority. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=294.53999999999996s)]
*  And so when that happens and you have to get something done, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=296.58s)]
*  and then all of a sudden you gotta look over, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=300.3s)]
*  oh gee whiz, we have to pick up some Democrat votes, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=302.26s)]
*  then the final bill isn't what we would like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=304.7s)]
*  because we have to actually pick up some Democrat votes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=307.46s)]
*  And so it actually works against us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=310.7s)]
*  And so, yeah, look, I don't think so. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=312.02s)]
*  These are the cards that are dealt. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=314.02s)]
*  What we've learned from ousting Kevin McCarthy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=315.9s)]
*  was that he was playing those cards [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  about as well as anybody could, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=321.9s)]
*  and Speaker Johnson's playing those cards [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=323.73999999999995s)]
*  about as well as anybody can. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=325.41999999999996s)]
*  Congressman, in the original CR, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  the debt ceiling wasn't even on the bingo card. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=328.9s)]
*  President-elect Trump put that in front and center. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=331.78s)]
*  How do you guys, when you come back, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  intend to deal with the debt ceiling, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=337.46s)]
*  and how much of a challenge will that be for you? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=339.9s)]
*  We have to increase the debt ceiling. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=343.5s)]
*  There is no way around it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=346.02s)]
*  I mean, we're not going to default [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  on the credit of the United States of America. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=348.14s)]
*  That would be catastrophic. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=350.34s)]
*  And anybody who tells you otherwise, just lying to you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  And so we have to deal with it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  And yeah, I understand what President Trump [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=355.62s)]
*  was trying to do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  He says, look, you're gonna have to do it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=358.5s)]
*  Why don't you do it now, don't do it on my watch, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=360.06s)]
*  because then that gives the Democrats leverage. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=362.06s)]
*  And so, look, we made a deal, or in principle, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  that we were gonna be increasing the debt limit [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=369.38s)]
*  by $1.5 trillion. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=372.29999999999995s)]
*  But we're also going to, in that reconciliation package, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=375.06s)]
*  also put in $2.5 trillion worth of fewer expenses [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=379.26s)]
*  or expense cuts in that reconciliation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=385.58s)]
*  And so we need to start to reduce the deficit [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=388.82s)]
*  that we're accumulating here in the United States. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=392.3s)]
*  Can it happen overnight? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=394.74s)]
*  No, but we need to start it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=396.1s)]
*  And we need to get to a point where, yes, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=397.86s)]
*  we have a balanced budget, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=399.66s)]
*  and we start paying off that $36 trillion debt [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=400.82s)]
*  because we're stealing from our kids and grandchildren. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=404.1s)]
*  Just one quick follow-up on that, Congressman, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  and that is, what do you say to Americans [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  that say the debt ceiling has been raised [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=410.02000000000004s)]
*  more than 75 different times, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=412.62s)]
*  mostly on Republicans' watch, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=415.02000000000004s)]
*  and that if we keep raising the bill, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=417.14000000000004s)]
*  we're never gonna be able to pay it? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=419.3s)]
*  Well, listen, we have to raise the debt limit right now [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=421.82000000000005s)]
*  because of the four years of President Biden, okay? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=424.98s)]
*  Most of this stuff comes after the fact. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  You authorize it, you appropriate the money, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=431.86s)]
*  and then you start issuing that money, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=434.34s)]
*  but that comes later. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=436.14s)]
*  And so now we're gonna face that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=437.38s)]
*  I think by June, we're gonna have to face the debt limit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=439.54s)]
*  Look, we can't continue on this track. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  That's why we did this in principle [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=444.42s)]
*  and we're committed to it, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=447.38s)]
*  is start to reduce the deficit. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=448.78s)]
*  We have to. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=451.5s)]
*  And like I said, it's not gonna happen overnight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=452.34s)]
*  It's gonna take some time. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=454.18s)]
*  But we gotta get to a point where we balance the budget [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=455.46s)]
*  and we start paying off our debt. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=458.46s)]
*  And by the way, at the end of the day, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm telling you, the only thing [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=462.58s)]
*  that really is going to allow us to do this, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=463.42s)]
*  we have to pass a balanced budget amendment [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=466.97999999999996s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=469.82s)]
*  That'll give us, force us to be disciplined, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=470.94s)]
*  not only when Republicans are in power, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=473.65999999999997s)]
*  but also when Democrats are in power. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=475.7s)]
*  And that's the way to bring this debt down [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=477.62s)]
*  and stop stealing from our children and grandchildren. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=479.74s)]
*  That would be music to anybody's ears. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=482.3s)]
*  So the next Congress has sworn in on January 3rd, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=484.06s)]
*  even slimmer majority than you have right now. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=486.53999999999996s)]
*  But yesterday you did cross the finish line. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=488.34s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2k5n_y5D0&t=490.82s)]
