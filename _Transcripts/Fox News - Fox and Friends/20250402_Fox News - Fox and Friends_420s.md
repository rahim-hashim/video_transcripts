# Dems' 'scorched-Earth' campaign against Musk is VERY dangerous, Turley says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=0.0s)]
*  Liberals getting a special election win in the battleground state of Wisconsin in a court [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=4.24s)]
*  race that could have a ripple effect in Washington. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=9.88s)]
*  And in Florida, Republicans hold on to two key House seats, boosting their slim majority. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=12.96s)]
*  Well, Brooke Singman is going to join us more on this Wednesday with the Tuesday result. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=18.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=24.28s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=25.28s)]
*  Winning in the Sunshine State means that Republicans now hold a seven-seat House majority. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=26.28s)]
*  In Florida's first district, Republican Jimmy Patron is defeating Democrat Gaye Valamont [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  to retain the seat previously held by Matt Gaetz, who resigned back in November. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=35.28s)]
*  And in Florida, six Trump-backed state Senator Randy Fein beat Bernie Sanders-backed Democrat [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=40.08s)]
*  Josh Wild to win the seat previously held by Michael Waltz, who is now the White House [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  national security adviser. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  So President Trump is celebrating these victories, saying, quote, both Florida House seats have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=51.24s)]
*  been won big by the Republican candidate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=55.56s)]
*  The Trump endorsement, as always, proved far greater than the Democrats' forces of evil. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=58.24s)]
*  Congratulations to America. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=63.88s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=65.8s)]
*  So I promise you this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=66.8s)]
*  You have entrusted me with something extraordinary, the opportunity to go and fight for you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=70.36s)]
*  I'm not going to let you down. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=75.36s)]
*  I'm not going to let my family down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=77.36s)]
*  I'm not going to let my boys down. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=79.6s)]
*  And I'm definitely not going to let my mom down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=81.88s)]
*  CD1 is where the hopes and dreams of the Democratic Party come to die. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=84.12s)]
*  Let it be known that this election is a reminder that the Florida Pan handle will forever be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  red and will be forever Trump country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=94.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Wisconsin's Supreme Court will keep its 4-3 liberal majority. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=97.12s)]
*  The election's historic turnout caused seven Milwaukee polling stations to run out of ballots. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  Democrat-backed Judge Susan Crawford defeating conservative Judge Brad Schimel in the most [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  expensive judicial race in U.S. history. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=113.04s)]
*  My promise to Wisconsin is clear. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=116.84s)]
*  I will be a fair, impartial, and common-sense justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=119.2s)]
*  And I want to thank everyone across the state who helped to get us to this point. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm here because of you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=135.76s)]
*  Yeah, Democrats are seeing this victory as a referendum on Trump and Elon Musk, who joined [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=137.28s)]
*  the five and discussed why he spent his time and money supporting the conservative judge. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  The reason tonight's elections are so important is that the judge at race will decide whether [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  the Wisconsin districts get redrawn. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=153.56s)]
*  They're going to try to gerrymander Wisconsin to remove two Republican seats. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  And as you know, the House is currently Republican by a razor-thin margin, which means that losing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=162.2s)]
*  this judge race has a good chance of causing Republicans to lose control of the House. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=169.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, the president hailed Wisconsin voters for enshrining the state's voter ID [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=175.12s)]
*  law in their constitution, Trump saying, quote, This is a big win for Republicans, maybe the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  biggest win of the night. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=185.56s)]
*  It should allow us to win Wisconsin like I just did in the presidential election for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  many years to come. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=191.72s)]
*  Steve, back to you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  A lot going on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=194.88s)]
*  Thank you very much, Brooke. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=195.88s)]
*  Here to break down what this means for Wisconsin's congressional map and future of the Republican [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=196.96s)]
*  House in the U.S. House, Fox's contributor, Jonathan Turley. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  Hey, Jonathan, good morning. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=205.4s)]
*  Hi, Steve. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=208.0s)]
*  You know, this is not surprising. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=209.0s)]
*  I mean, Wisconsin is a purple state. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=210.88s)]
*  It's not a red state. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=213.4s)]
*  Donald Trump only won it by a little bit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=214.4s)]
*  And it just goes to show you that you pump a whole bunch of money from both sides into [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=217.32s)]
*  an election, into a state in the Midwest, and people get motivated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=221.44s)]
*  They turned out in droves. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=226.16s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=229.8s)]
*  What's interesting, though, is that Crawford is very liberal. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=230.8s)]
*  So this is a court now that's a little bit out of sync with a purple state. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=233.56s)]
*  There's a lot of moderates in Wisconsin. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=238.36s)]
*  I wouldn't call this a moderate Supreme Court. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  Just recently, the Supreme Court, the day before the election, heard an argument coming [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=244.28s)]
*  from the Wisconsin Supreme Court in which that court really laid down a devastating [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=249.46s)]
*  standard for religious organizations. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=254.48s)]
*  They said that Catholic charities could not be exempt because they, quite frankly, don't [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=256.68s)]
*  pray enough, that because Catholic charities does not turn away people from other faiths [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=261.68s)]
*  because they don't proselytize, the Wisconsin Supreme Court treated them like Starbucks. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=266.8s)]
*  And many of these justices really raised concern, including people on the, justices on the left. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=272.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=280.88s)]
*  And said, that's a pretty bad standard. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=281.88s)]
*  You know, you're going to put the government in a position of determining when you're praying [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=283.56s)]
*  enough, when you're proselytizing enough, instead of looking at why they're doing it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  because they're the Catholic charities. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=291.12s)]
*  So you could see a lot more of those cases coming out of Wisconsin. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=293.44s)]
*  You know, and Brooke just had that soundbite where Democrats in Wisconsin say this is a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=297.36s)]
*  referendum on Donald Trump and on Elon Musk. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=302.4s)]
*  That's not the way it was presented. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  The Democrats ran against Elon Musk. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=307.4s)]
*  They said he's the world's richest man and he can't buy an election. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=310.0s)]
*  So it wasn't about Trump as much as it was about Musk. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=314.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=320.92s)]
*  And there's this scorched earth campaign going on. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=321.92s)]
*  I just have a column out today on this where Democrats are shredding many of the things [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=323.8s)]
*  they believe most fervently about. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=329.44s)]
*  They're adopting anti-environmental positions, anti-labor positions just to get Musk. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=331.88s)]
*  It's really untoward, but also with the rise of political violence on the left, it's very [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=337.96s)]
*  concerning. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=343.56s)]
*  It's very dangerous. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=344.56s)]
*  And we're not seeing what we were hoping to see from Democratic leadership denouncing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=346.12s)]
*  this campaign. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And so going forward, given the fact that this is, as you said, a very liberal bench [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=353.28s)]
*  now, look for suggestions and rulings on abortion, labor rights, and of course redrawing a couple [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=358.44s)]
*  of those districts, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  And this court was responsible for the loss of 14 seats when it rejected an electoral [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  map. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=375.48s)]
*  Notably what it did, by the way, is it threw out the existing standard used by the Wisconsin [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=376.48s)]
*  Supreme Court to allow it to effectively redraw the maps. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=381.44s)]
*  That allowed for 14 more Democrats to go into the assembly. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=385.88s)]
*  And the expectation, in fact, all this money is on Crawford doing, you know, voting in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=389.64s)]
*  the same way to allow for two more seats in the House of Representatives to be lost due [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=395.4s)]
*  to redesigned districts. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=404.2s)]
*  From the District of Columbia, Jonathan Turley, thank you very much for joining us live. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=405.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWQzGWQ3Xc0&t=419.64s)]
