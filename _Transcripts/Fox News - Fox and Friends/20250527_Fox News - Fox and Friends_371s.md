# Biden aides were willing to do 'undemocratic' things to keep him in office, author warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M)
*  Well, speaking of delay, we were delayed in getting some information from the administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, we kind of knew because we have eyes and we can see the American people saw it, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=4.84s)]
*  obviously, throughout his presidency, even before the presidency. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=8.56s)]
*  But the administration, the former administration officials, have this new line of defense. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=12.4s)]
*  I was raised, when you say an apology, you don't say but. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=17.72s)]
*  But they say they did it but because that they were fearful of democracy and Donald [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=21.16s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=27.64s)]
*  And then they had something that was totally undemocratic, which had non elected officials [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=28.64s)]
*  running the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=33.28s)]
*  So the Obama bros got together and this is what they said on the podcast. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=34.54s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=39.88s)]
*  We went to the White House and saw Joe Biden who had just come back from a trip and he [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=41.14s)]
*  was I don't think it wasn't as as I think, egregious as what you hear in the audio around [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=46.88s)]
*  the her report. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=52.08s)]
*  This was April, April and he was rambling and he was hard to follow and he repeated [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=53.08s)]
*  a story. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=57.059999999999995s)]
*  But then we were assured by people around him that he was just exhausted. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  I remember feeling I want to talk about this as a huge liability. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=61.66s)]
*  I want to talk about this as something Joe Biden can overcome. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=66.86s)]
*  But I'm not going to go so far as to say I think Joe Biden must drop out. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=69.96s)]
*  He is too old to be president, a because I didn't know exactly what was going on behind [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=73.46s)]
*  the scenes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  But B, if Joe Biden is the candidate, I want him to win because I care about the country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  So I guess this is kind of helpful in that it reaches new people and and and exposes [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=84.18s)]
*  the story to new people that maybe we haven't been reaching ourselves. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  But it is kind of amazing to sit back now and think four years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=96.30000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you read like this book, this new book out original sin by Jake Tapper and Alex [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=100.86000000000001s)]
*  Thompson, if you read that book today, for us, it's completely boring. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  It looks it's like a you could boil it down to two pages. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=111.1s)]
*  And it's like reading transcripts from everything that we've been talking about for the past [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=114.1s)]
*  four years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  And that and and and but you know, and of course, the biggest problem of all is that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=119.36s)]
*  so many reporters like Jake Tapper and even Alex Thompson to some degree had spent that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=124.02s)]
*  exact same four years trying to stamp out these stories and prevent people from hearing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=130.45999999999998s)]
*  those stories. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  So that what that soundbite was John Lovett. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  He was a former Obama speechwriter and he was on with John Stewart. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=140.3s)]
*  And he was basically saying we didn't care if this was the worst candidate ever. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  We were going to do whatever it took to win. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=149.86s)]
*  And you mentioned the book, Alex Thompson was on with Shannon Bream over the weekend. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=152.58s)]
*  And he talked about how they had just this cadre of handlers and aides that were running [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=157.66000000000003s)]
*  things behind the scenes, people that weren't even elected. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=162.78s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=165.94s)]
*  In the book, you quote a longtime Biden aide basically admitting he shouldn't be running [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=166.98s)]
*  again, they said to you on page 85, he just had to win and then he could disappear for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=170.5s)]
*  four years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=175.26s)]
*  He'd only have to show proof of life every once in a while. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=176.26s)]
*  His aides could pick up the slack. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=179.48s)]
*  Who would have been running the White House in a second Biden term? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=181.24s)]
*  This person went on to say that when you're voting for a president, you're voting for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=184.82s)]
*  the aides around him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=187.5s)]
*  These aides were not even Senate confirmed aides. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=189.78s)]
*  These are a White House aides. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=192.14s)]
*  These were unelected people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=193.46s)]
*  One of the things that really I think comes out in our reporting here is that if you believe [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=195.26s)]
*  and I think a lot of these people do sincerely believe that Donald Trump was and is an essential [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=200.04s)]
*  threat to democracy, you can rationalize anything, including sometimes doing undemocratic things, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=204.1s)]
*  which I think is what this person is talking about. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=209.3s)]
*  This is clearly elder abuse. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=212.02s)]
*  I mean, they literally are saying we just need just as long as he's alive, we'll keep [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=213.94s)]
*  propping him up. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=219.58s)]
*  But I think it's the latter part of the conversation that deserves the investigation, which is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=220.86s)]
*  the concession that they knew the entire time, but they didn't want us to know about it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=229.46s)]
*  I think that part deserves hearings to figure out all the people in the cabinet that were [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=235.34s)]
*  doing the propping up. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=240.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=242.14s)]
*  And for someone to tell those authors, he'd only have to show proof of life every once [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=243.14s)]
*  in a while. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=247.74s)]
*  This is the president of the United States. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=248.74s)]
*  Imagine yesterday Memorial Day. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  Imagine if you're a gold star family and you lost your loved one, your child, let's say, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=252.62s)]
*  because of Afghanistan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=257.7s)]
*  Perfect example. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=260.94s)]
*  Under Joe Biden's administration, how upset would you be when the person in charge can't [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=262.26s)]
*  even run the show? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=266.7s)]
*  People who weren't elected behind the scenes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=268.18s)]
*  We don't know them all. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=270.3s)]
*  We're running the show, running the country. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=271.5s)]
*  He's commander in chief. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=274.04s)]
*  That title means something. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=276.3s)]
*  You're commander in chief and there's only one and you get elected. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=277.5s)]
*  That's what it's all about. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=281.18s)]
*  And after all these years of us getting lectured about democracy and I think you're exactly [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=282.18s)]
*  right, Lawrence. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=287.85999999999996s)]
*  It's not about Joe Biden. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=288.85999999999996s)]
*  No, it's about everybody that was using him and using and basically overriding our democracy [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=290.7s)]
*  in order to exercise their own power, even though they were none of them were alive. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=297.94s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=302.46s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=303.46s)]
*  I was upset with Joe Biden for a while about all of this because I'm like, you know, you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=305.34s)]
*  should do the right thing for the country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=310.58s)]
*  It's clear here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=312.26s)]
*  But judging by the book and all the accounts, no one told Joe Biden that he was in decline. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=313.73999999999995s)]
*  Everyone hid it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  All the accounts show that not only his family, but all the staffers. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  And then you put yourself with the elderly people that have been in our lives that we [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=323.62s)]
*  have to take the keys away. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  They're all in denial about it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=330.06s)]
*  But you make the right decision for them and you say, hey, this is what's going on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=331.82s)]
*  We got to do this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=335.5s)]
*  We love you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=336.5s)]
*  We're going to be with you every step of the way. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=337.5s)]
*  At no point does it say in the book or any of the accounts that they told the president, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=338.5s)]
*  things are bad now. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=343.42s)]
*  Yeah, they had a responsibility to do that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=344.42s)]
*  And especially for the American people and for our troops. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=346.5s)]
*  But I mean, to also know that he wasn't getting PSA tests. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=349.74s)]
*  They didn't have the blood. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  This is the president of the United States. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=358.46s)]
*  Keeps going. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6kIP31P8M&t=359.46s)]
