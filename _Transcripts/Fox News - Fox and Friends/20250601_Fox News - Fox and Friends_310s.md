# Whistleblower claims Biden failed to investigate child trafficking reports
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU)
*  The Trump White House currently facing a backlog of thousands of reported cases of child of illegal child migrants being victims of human trafficking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=0.0s)]
*  According to HHS, the Biden administration failed to investigate more than 7000 cases reported as part of a 65000 case backlog. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=10.16s)]
*  HHS whistleblower Tara Rodas joins us now. Tara, I know this is an issue close to your heart. It's close to mine as well. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=19.64s)]
*  Tell us what's happened since you have been a whistleblower during the last administration. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=28.0s)]
*  What's been happening now and about the 7000 cases that the Biden administration failed to probe? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  Yes, well, good morning, Rachel. It's a pleasure to be here and thank you so much for shining a light [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  on what we now know was the Biden Harris administration, government sponsored, taxpayer funded child trafficking. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  So the new administration under President Trump has taken unprecedented action to find these children. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=56.08s)]
*  Now, sadly, they were stonewalled here in the beginning. They're starting to get access to the data. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=64.96s)]
*  Senator Grassley, who has been a huge champion for these endangered children, has been on the case, putting forward subpoenas, putting forward cases. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=70.72s)]
*  And the Trump administration miraculously in just a four month period has gone through about 28 percent of that backlog. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=80.72s)]
*  There's much more work to be done to save these endangered children. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=88.32s)]
*  And thank you so much for shining a light on this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=92.24s)]
*  I think America needs to know about this great humanitarian crisis that we have with these endangered children. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=95.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's remarkable. I still remember Javier Becerra saying, you know, referring to the the the children as like widgets on a Ford assembly line. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=101.92s)]
*  Telling HHS are telling all of his employees at HHS, hurry up, process them through, process them through. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=110.72s)]
*  So they all got through. And now what? How is how is the Trump administration dealing with this? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=118.16s)]
*  Is it that they're going out and finding the kids? How is it working? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=122.88s)]
*  Because we're all so curious. Where are they? Who has them? Who are these adults? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=127.04s)]
*  And does something happen to the adults who are claiming to be their parents? Many of them aren't. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=131.44s)]
*  Well, yes, we do know that many of these sponsors of the children are not family. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  In some zip codes, the New York Times, if you can imagine, even revealed that in some zip codes, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  less than 10 percent of the children went to family members. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=150.48s)]
*  This is unacceptable. When I raised my hand to help the Biden administration with this crisis, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=154.32s)]
*  I believed I was going to help place children in loving homes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  I had no idea that we were sending children to criminals, to traffickers and to members of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=164.4s)]
*  transnational criminal organizations. So the Biden Harris failed. Open border policy allowed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=170.88s)]
*  bad actors into the country, transnational criminal organizations, foreign terrorist [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  organizations, MS-13, 18th Street gang. And we know they are sponsors of children. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=183.76s)]
*  We know that to be fact because in early 2021, DHS whistleblower Aaron Stevenson began to sound [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=191.04s)]
*  the alarm that 18th Street gang, MS-13 were getting the children. So the Biden Harris [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  administration turned vulnerable children over to high-level criminal actors. So these children, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=206.16s)]
*  they're not merely victims of this terrible border policy under the previous administration. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  They are actually now hostages to criminal cartels. And this administration will not stand [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=220.56s)]
*  for that. They will not allow crimes against children to stand on their watch. And they are [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=227.84s)]
*  out there using every mechanism that they have. There's still more work to be done. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=233.52s)]
*  There's still more data analytics solutions that can be done. There's still access to data systems [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=239.04s)]
*  that they need, but they're going to get it and they're going to find these children. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=244.56s)]
*  Well, it is just remarkable hearing that our government allowed this to happen under their [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=247.68s)]
*  watch knowingly Joe Biden did this because they were so committed to their open border policy, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=254.56s)]
*  probably for electoral reasons, and they didn't care that they were child victims in the process. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=260.64s)]
*  Thank God that you are doing the work you're doing. Thank God for Grassley and of course, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=267.12s)]
*  for Donald Trump and Bobby Kennedy who have committed themselves to finding as many of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=273.36s)]
*  these children as we can. Sadly, I think some of them will be lost forever. But Tara, we really [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  thank you for coming in. As you get more information and more updates, please let us know. We want to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=284.48s)]
*  follow the story. We care about these children and it's very sad. Thank you so much, Tara Rhodes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeO_UbLeCU&t=289.2s)]
