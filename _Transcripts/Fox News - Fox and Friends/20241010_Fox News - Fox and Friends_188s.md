# 'DEVASTATING': Millions of Floridians without power following Milton's deadly tornadoes
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E)
*  So Senator, tell us, we're learning that about 3.0, over 3 million folks are waking up this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=0.0s)]
*  morning without power. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=6.32s)]
*  What's the timeline on getting it restored? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  I know Ron DeSantis is really good at this and he has those line workers already on standby. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=10.64s)]
*  What do you know about this? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=19.16s)]
*  So I talked to, last couple days I talked to all the utilities. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=22.14s)]
*  They have an unbelievable number of linemen coming in, they're pre-positioned. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=26.52s)]
*  So here, but here it's going to take a lot of work, especially where there's, in rural [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=32.36s)]
*  areas where they have a lot of water, it's really, it really is hard. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=38.16s)]
*  But it's going to take a while. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=43.0s)]
*  I think with Irma we had a total of 13 million people without power. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=44.56s)]
*  So it took quite a while to get everywhere. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=49.1s)]
*  We had thousands of linemen come in. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=53.08s)]
*  And this is what's hard now is we have a lot of linemen that are just tired. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=55.36s)]
*  I mean, they've been working because of the lean in all these states trying to restore [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  power and you still have power outages in places in North Carolina and places like that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  So it's going to take a lot of work. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  It's going to take a while, especially the rural areas, which is harder to get to all [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  the houses and all the down trees and things like that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=76.2s)]
*  So Senator. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=80.2s)]
*  But hopefully in the next few days, power will start coming back on quickly and we will [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  start rebuilding and we will not have any death. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=86.48s)]
*  I mean, you can rebuild all this stuff. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=90.2s)]
*  It scares you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=92.36s)]
*  It's just the number of people that are going to die. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=94.36s)]
*  Senator, were you surprised by all the tornadoes in your experience? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=96.12s)]
*  Have you seen this many that were south of the storm? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=99.12s)]
*  And Steve, with his meteorology experience, said that's on the dry side and that's why [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=101.48s)]
*  you see all of these. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=105.64s)]
*  But I talked to people who were not in the cone area and they said if we had known all [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=106.64s)]
*  these tornadoes were going to pop up, we might have decided to evacuate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=110.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's never before. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=115.92s)]
*  You know, we had that rain bands way outside the path of tornadoes or the hurricane. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=118.36s)]
*  But the tornadoes, the number of tornadoes and the severity of these tornadoes, it was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=125.2s)]
*  devastating. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=133.24s)]
*  You talked to the sheriffs in the impacted areas and they were just shocked with the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=134.24s)]
*  damage. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=140.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, we're going to lose life as a result of it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=141.2s)]
*  Senator, when are you going to be able to get home? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=146.0s)]
*  Are you going to wait for law enforcement to give you the high sign? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=147.84s)]
*  Yeah, hopefully. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=151.56s)]
*  Hopefully, in Naples, we didn't get as much rain yesterday, but it's raining now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=154.76s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  The issue most likely is going to be how much flooding we have here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  But I'm going to do whatever I can to. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=165.6s)]
*  I've got nine offices open around the state. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=168.4s)]
*  We are open working remotely to try to help anybody that needs help just trying to coordinate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=169.96s)]
*  anything we can do with federal resources, the state and local resources to get people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=176.28s)]
*  help. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=181.56s)]
*  Well, then people can reach out to your Senate office. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=182.56s)]
*  Senator, thank you very much for joining us on this very busy Thursday. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=184.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZljKDoUhg2E&t=187.04000000000002s)]
