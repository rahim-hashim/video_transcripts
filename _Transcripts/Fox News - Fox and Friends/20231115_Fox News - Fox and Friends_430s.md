# IDF going room to room in Gaza hospital raid in hunt for Hamas
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo)
*  Well, this is a Fox News alert right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli troops are going room to room inside Gaza's largest hospital after some bloody [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=10.96s)]
*  street battles, as you can see. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=16.5s)]
*  And they're also going underground. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=18.16s)]
*  They're hunting for Hamas terrorists, and they're looking for any information on those [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=19.72s)]
*  200-plus hostages that were taken in that attack on October 7. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=23.32s)]
*  It's really dangerous, Ainsley, because they don't have the surprise that they typically [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=26.92s)]
*  would have. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  The White House now publicly stating what the Israelis have said all along, that Hamas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=32.56s)]
*  is using medical facilities as command centers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=37.72s)]
*  I can confirm for you that we have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including Al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them to conceal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=49.1s)]
*  and to support their military operations and the old hostages. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=55.34s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  This targeted raid coming after the IDF's delivery of incubators, baby food, and medical [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  supplies to help doctors caring for Palestinian civilians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=66.5s)]
*  We also have a medical ship that France is sending right up the coast. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=70.06s)]
*  And I am right now in our nation's capital one day after, look at that, nearly 300,000 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=73.82s)]
*  people peacefully rallied against anti-Semitism and for the safe return of the 200-plus hostages. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=79.26s)]
*  We're going to have more on that march for Israel in just a moment, but first we go to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=86.26s)]
*  Alex Hogan live on the ground in northern Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=92.22s)]
*  Alex? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=95.18s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=96.18s)]
*  It's been really increased tension here, a major attack just taking place on the hillside [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=97.98s)]
*  behind me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=102.78s)]
*  Our crew ran downstairs to the bomb shelter where we have a monitor showing what it looks [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=103.78s)]
*  like up here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=107.98s)]
*  We have a camera able to see what is taking place and we saw about 15 incoming rockets [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=109.7s)]
*  again hitting the hillside behind me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  You can still see some of the smoke there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=115.14s)]
*  The hillside is the border of Lebanon, so those were 15 missiles and rockets fired this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=117.58s)]
*  way from Hezbollah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, looking at the south, major escalation there as well in Gaza as the IDF [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  presses forward entering now the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  This is the largest hospital in Gaza where the IDF says today it was able to find weapons, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=131.38s)]
*  ammunition and more military infrastructure inside that hospital. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  That is something that we've heard from the Pentagon this week confirming that they agree, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=141.17999999999998s)]
*  they believe that Hamas has been using some of these medical facilities as places to not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=144.78s)]
*  only store weapons, but potentially store hostages as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=149.42s)]
*  So more will likely come throughout the day about what exactly they find after this stalemate [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  that we've seen in recent days. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=158.82s)]
*  But the IDF also delivered much needed supplies, health care systems, food, baby formula for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  those children that are still there in the patients. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=167.34s)]
*  But the IDF also in entering the hospital, we're hearing some alarming concerns from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=169.9s)]
*  the UN saying that they have not been able to get in touch with any of their hospital [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  staff. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=179.38s)]
*  And all of this is taking place as the IDF presses further into Gaza. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=180.38s)]
*  The country's defense minister, Youav Gallant, says that there would be no space for people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=184.3s)]
*  anywhere, no safety until those hostages are returned. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, we're learning more about a Biden administration deal that would essentially [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=192.74s)]
*  allow Iran to access $10 billion from Iraq in electricity purchases. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=196.86s)]
*  That's creating a lot of concern, of course, because as we're seeing these rocket attacks [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  coming here and these missiles that are from Hezbollah, we do know that Hezbollah is largely [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=206.86s)]
*  funded by Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=211.18s)]
*  So a lot of concern on that front, especially as we continue to see these attacks on U.S. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=212.66000000000003s)]
*  military bases here in the Middle East. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=219.3s)]
*  Hey, Alex, I'm wondering, did that rocket get knocked out by missile defense or any [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=220.3s)]
*  type of Iron Dome activity, or did it land it? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  No, it did not. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=227.7s)]
*  Honestly, in parts of this part of the country, you're lucky if you get 10 seconds to make [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=228.98s)]
*  it to a shelter. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=233.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=234.62s)]
*  And with most of the town that you see behind me completely evacuated, the Iron Dome not [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=235.62s)]
*  striking every single rocket missile that we do see. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=239.86s)]
*  We have seen soldiers stationed throughout a lot of the fields in this area. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=243.62s)]
*  And what they do, they essentially, right after we see these incoming attacks, we'll [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=247.9s)]
*  start to fire off. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=252.74s)]
*  And that's the IDF locating exactly where these launches were sent from and then taking [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=253.9s)]
*  out those targets. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=259.62s)]
*  So within a few seconds, we were able to hear those crossfire attacks and we'll likely [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=260.62s)]
*  continue to hear that throughout the day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=265.22s)]
*  Worth noting, as Hezbollah was firing here on the north, there were also Hamas rockets [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=267.3s)]
*  being fired from Gaza. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=272.06s)]
*  So while the north is definitely in a state of escalation, we're continuing to see that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=274.06s)]
*  along the south for residents there as well. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=278.66s)]
*  They can still have rocket fire. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=280.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=282.9s)]
*  And Alex, you were talking a little bit about how the IDF was doing targeted searches inside [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=283.9s)]
*  the hospital. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=290.1s)]
*  I was just noticing on Daily Mail that it said that apparently they went in, IDF, the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=291.1s)]
*  Israelis went in with a bullhorn, speaking in Arabic and said, all men 16 years and above, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  raise your hands, and exit the building to go out into the courtyard. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=303.02s)]
*  And they led, there were a thousand guys that qualified, men hiding under the hospital, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=307.1s)]
*  taken outside. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=315.14s)]
*  They were searched for weapons and also guns and stuff like that, which just proves if [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=316.58s)]
*  they took a thousand young men out of the hospital this morning, that just proves that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=321.74s)]
*  the Hamas was using that as an HQ. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=328.9s)]
*  Yeah, and we've heard from the IDF that the main concern in recent days and the reason [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=333.06s)]
*  for not going in any sooner was the very real threat that this would impact patients that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=338.14s)]
*  are in there, patients that are hooked up and cannot leave the machine specifically [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=343.38s)]
*  that they're on. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  The IDF today says that it was able to go in with these tactical approaches. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=348.38s)]
*  And as you mentioned, there were Arabic speakers, soldiers within the IDF who had been specifically [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=352.26s)]
*  to try to go in, find Hamas militants, but also prevent the loss of life from civilians [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  that are trapped and really unable to evacuate. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=363.46s)]
*  We've heard for weeks now the IDF trying to get those patients out, but it's simply not [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  possible for some of these patients that cannot be evacuated. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  They can't be unhooked from their machines. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=374.4s)]
*  It will be very interesting to see in the hours that follow what exactly it is that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  they find. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=381.26s)]
*  We do have some first images now coming out of what it looks like, some of the artillery [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=382.26s)]
*  that they found, the military set up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=386.38s)]
*  But it is really important to note that this has been a major operation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=389.18s)]
*  This is exactly where the IDF says that it's been able to locate this Hamas stronghold. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=392.82s)]
*  And it was just last night when the country's defense minister said that the IDF has now [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=398.98s)]
*  fully taken control of the north, while it also mentioned that the Al-Shifa hospital [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=402.86s)]
*  was this crucial, crucial spot that it needed to be able to enter. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=407.90000000000003s)]
*  So if the IDF does fully manage to take Al-Shifa, it's going to be very interesting to watch [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=412.46s)]
*  to see what plays out by this time tomorrow. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=418.7s)]
*  Well, maybe if they do, they'll be able to go down into the tunnel system and grab our [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=421.9s)]
*  hostages that are there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=426.06s)]
*  Thank you so much, Alex. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A7Kv4U2mOo&t=427.82s)]
