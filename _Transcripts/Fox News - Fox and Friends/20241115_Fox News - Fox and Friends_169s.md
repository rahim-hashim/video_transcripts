# Venezuelan gang sparks fears after infiltrating another state
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g)
*  So Tennessee law enforcement warning that the violent Venezuelan game, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=0.0s)]
*  Twinde de Agua, is now operating in every major city and the state. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=3.6s)]
*  Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rauch has been warning [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=8.22s)]
*  local leaders about the growing threat and joins us now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=11.92s)]
*  Sir, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=15.68s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=18.82s)]
*  So what's the big issue as it relates to your law enforcement capabilities? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=19.92s)]
*  Is the current federal, you know, detainers and all that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  preventing you from doing your job? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  Give us the scope. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=33.28s)]
*  No, I don't think it's any of that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=35.58s)]
*  I think what we have is, unfortunately, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=37.16s)]
*  because of the porous border, this gang has exploited it [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=40.16s)]
*  and they are actively working throughout our country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=44.32s)]
*  And we know because of our investigations, they are actively working in Tennessee. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=48.26s)]
*  They are in our four major cities, Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=54.16s)]
*  And they are running human trafficking operations right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=59.44s)]
*  We we first noticed them about two years ago [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=62.54s)]
*  during a trafficking operation in middle Tennessee. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=65.98s)]
*  And we thought after we had captured a few of them, we knew some of them had fled. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=69.28s)]
*  We thought that they would move out of Tennessee, but they have moved back. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=73.88s)]
*  And we are aware now after some meetings this past month, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=77.12s)]
*  we're aware that they are moving into different operations. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=81.76s)]
*  They they go from human trafficking to organize retail crime theft. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=85.12s)]
*  And then they move into the drug trade, taking on the cartels [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=89.26s)]
*  in a very violent, bloody battles that they've had. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=92.7s)]
*  And they also have zero respect for policing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=96.7s)]
*  They have attacked law enforcement officers throughout our nation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=99.88s)]
*  So, sir, what do you charge them with? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=103.08s)]
*  You see that these folks may be allegedly a part of Trinidad and Agua. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=104.68s)]
*  If they if you haven't witnessed them committing a crime, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=108.54s)]
*  got any evidence of a crime right now because of the current administration, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=111.14s)]
*  you can't turn them over the ice to be deported. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=115.62s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=118.12s)]
*  Yeah, so that's that's a challenge we do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=120.98s)]
*  If we come upon them and they have a detainer on them, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=123.56s)]
*  then we can take them into custody. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=126.16s)]
*  But other than that, then all we can do is monitor [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=128.26s)]
*  and and assure that they aren't violating the law. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=130.52s)]
*  But that is a challenge. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=134.06s)]
*  That's a game of cat and mouse, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=135.84s)]
*  Very much so. Very much so. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=138.6s)]
*  We we do that, unfortunately, too frequently. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=140.34s)]
*  And and with these very violent, violent criminals, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  it is it's a dangerous game. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=147.54s)]
*  I'm hoping with the new administration, as a matter of fact, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=150.64s)]
*  I know things are going to change. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=152.72s)]
*  Sir, thank you so much for all that you do. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=154.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaLugNnM1g&t=157.52s)]
