# Why Bezos is 'very optimistic' about Trump's new term
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg)
*  More and more, as we switch gears now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=0.0s)]
*  you see more and more people who were not on the Trump train [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=2.0s)]
*  the first time around, didn't want to accept it, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=4.72s)]
*  perhaps jealous of it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=6.4s)]
*  The guy who owns the Washington Post was one of them. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  The big critic of Trump, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  making sarcastic comments about Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=11.44s)]
*  for the first four years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=13.16s)]
*  Trump took aim at Jeff Bezos, too, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  and his own Washington Post. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=16.4s)]
*  You got the sense things would be different, in my view. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=18.0s)]
*  When Jeff Bezos told people at the Washington Post, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=20.6s)]
*  we're not gonna endorse a candidate [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=22.6s)]
*  leading up to the election. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=23.84s)]
*  He had a bunch of people quit because of that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=25.12s)]
*  Can you believe a guy losing $70 million a year [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=26.88s)]
*  to keep them employed would get... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  The people would get so upset they would quit on him, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=31.36s)]
*  but he didn't. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=33.44s)]
*  So you hear Jamie Dimon's been talking to the president, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=34.28s)]
*  J.P. Morgan, for weeks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=36.64s)]
*  He used to be somewhat of a critic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=38.32s)]
*  And then you see Elon Musk, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=40.08s)]
*  who had walked off the president's business council [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=41.68s)]
*  after what he thought was a controversy in Charlottesville. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  He is now firmly on board, and those two are bros, it seems. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=47.52s)]
*  Now he's working for him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=51.16s)]
*  The latest one to come aboard is Jeff Bezos of Amazon, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  saying nice things yesterday. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=55.88s)]
*  Yeah, he said he was optimistic about working [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=57.72s)]
*  with a calmer Trump, and he can help him reduce regulation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=59.72s)]
*  Listen to what else he said. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=63.28s)]
*  If we're talking about Trump, I think it's very interesting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=66.6s)]
*  I'm actually very optimistic this time around [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=69.6s)]
*  that we're gonna see... [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=73.36s)]
*  I'm very hopeful about his... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=75.48s)]
*  He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=79.68s)]
*  And my point of view, if I can help him do that, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=83.52s)]
*  I'm gonna help him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=86.32s)]
*  Because we do have too much regulation in this country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=88.04s)]
*  This country is so set up to grow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=90.32s)]
*  He's absolutely right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=95.52s)]
*  And so later today, at 10 o'clock this morning, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency, DOJ, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=100.96s)]
*  which is being headed up by Vivek Rajaswamy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=103.84s)]
*  and also Elon Musk, they're going to go to the US Senate. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=106.72s)]
*  Joni Ernst is going to be hosting them this morning. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=111.12s)]
*  And then this afternoon at three o'clock, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=113.92s)]
*  they're gonna be meeting with both Houses [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=115.84s)]
*  at the behest of Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  And what's interesting about this, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=122.44s)]
*  and this kind of dovetails, Brian, to your point [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=123.8s)]
*  about how some people who were not Trump fans [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=127.2s)]
*  in the first Trump administration are now coming around. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=130.24s)]
*  This includes a bunch of Democrats. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=133.44s)]
*  There are actually... [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=134.92s)]
*  There's a thing now in the House called the DOJ Caucus. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=135.96s)]
*  And there are actually a number of Democrats [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  who are involved. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=142.28s)]
*  For instance, you got Jared Moskowitz. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=143.36s)]
*  He's on board. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=145.32s)]
*  Florida. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=146.52s)]
*  He would like to make the Social Security [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  and FEMA independent agencies [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  that would report directly to the White House. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=151.88s)]
*  Then you got Ro Khanna and Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=154.12s)]
*  They would like to cut government spending, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=155.96s)]
*  particularly at the Pentagon, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=158.2s)]
*  because, and the argument they make is, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  look, they failed like eight audits and stuff like that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=163.6s)]
*  And the brilliant thing about the DOJ Caucus [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=166.96s)]
*  is these people who may be on the other side [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=170.28s)]
*  of the political aisle, they can be on TV. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=174.08s)]
*  They can talk about government waste. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  They never have to take an official vote. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=179.24s)]
*  So in other words, it sure looks like they wanna cut stuff, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=181.68s)]
*  but they're not really cutting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=185.08s)]
*  Yeah, but listen to the elites in their comments. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  Jeff Bezos said, oh, he's for deregulation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=188.52s)]
*  Okay, he was the first time as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=190.8s)]
*  The only difference is is that you have a political mandate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=192.68s)]
*  that just happened. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=196.56s)]
*  You have the popular vote and electoral college. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  He won every single swing state. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  And so I think now these people, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=201.92s)]
*  you got even Mark Zuckerberg is saying [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=204.32s)]
*  that he likes Trump now and wants to have conversations [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=206.32s)]
*  with him, thought that he did have the conversation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=208.6s)]
*  He thought that it was fantastic what Trump did [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=211.64s)]
*  after the attempted assassination. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  He goes, he's never seen anything so courageous in his life, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=215.76s)]
*  but they have the political cover now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=220.04s)]
*  They didn't have the will before. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not gonna condemn them for coming on board, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=223.64s)]
*  but I do feel like there are some Johnny-come-latelys [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=225.72s)]
*  right now that the American people finally spoken. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=229.28s)]
*  There's a lot of us out here that just want [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=232.08s)]
*  a free market system, the border to be secure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=234.36s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  And now they're on board. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=237.44s)]
*  At least acknowledge you were wrong. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=238.28s)]
*  You were wrong. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg, if you wanna repress me, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  do what Elon Musk did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=242.72s)]
*  Let journalists go in to the Twitter files, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  go into the Facebook files. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  I wanna find out exactly what you were up to in 2016 [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=247.8s)]
*  and through the pandemic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  Expose what happened. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  Maybe you didn't know, maybe you did know. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  And find out who was really putting their hand on the scale [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=255.36s)]
*  to shadow ban Republicans and skew the pandemic. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=258.6s)]
*  If you just look at the umbrella effect of this though, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  it's wonderful for our country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=264.56s)]
*  We have President Trump, and then you have all of these [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=265.88s)]
*  leaders, these billionaires that are behind him, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=268.12s)]
*  that really impact all of our lives. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=269.88s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, I mean, we all order on Amazon. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  Monday, I spent more than I should have for cyber, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=273.68s)]
*  but I saved a lot. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=276.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, she's gonna show her bills a little bit [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=277.16s)]
*  in the next hour. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=278.48s)]
*  No, but I've gotten a lot accomplished. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=279.6s)]
*  But yeah, my point is Bezos is on board. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=281.48s)]
*  You have Elon Musk, who is the wealthiest man [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  in the world, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=286.36s)]
*  With Tesla. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  And then we have Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=288.8s)]
*  We're all on Instagram, we're all on Facebook. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=290.84s)]
*  I'm just excited about the fact that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=293.44s)]
*  it's all working together. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=295.04s)]
*  It's unity for the country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=295.88s)]
*  Well, it is unity, but I'm always skeptical. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=297.2s)]
*  They're doing it because it's their hides. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=299.88s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg, now that Donald Trump is in charge [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=303.56s)]
*  of the federal government for the most part, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  he doesn't want, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=308.56s)]
*  Donald Trump to regulate social media. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=310.92s)]
*  He doesn't want them to open up and take a really good look [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=314.24s)]
*  at a lot of this stuff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=317.64s)]
*  And that's why a lot of these people who suddenly, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=318.48s)]
*  we didn't hear a lot of them say anything [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=321.76s)]
*  before Trump was elected, but now smartly, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=323.8s)]
*  because it is survival. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  The kiss in the ring. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=327.72s)]
*  They are indeed, and you know what? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=328.56s)]
*  If that's what it takes for Donald Trump [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=330.88s)]
*  to get them on board, looks like they're on board. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=332.64s)]
*  Well, they're successful businessmen. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=334.76s)]
*  Maybe they'll get our country in order [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=336.12s)]
*  and cut out some of this waste. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=337.68s)]
*  But also with the lack of regulation, needs integrity. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=339.56s)]
*  I don't want to just drop the regulation [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=342.56s)]
*  and then let these guys go to town. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=344.4s)]
*  I hope they do it with integrity because they'll never, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=346.28s)]
*  those regulations will come right back. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=349.02s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=350.56s)]
*  Speaker Johnson said he would like to axe PBS [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=351.4s)]
*  and Planned Parenthood when he was on with Martha. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=354.12s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_kBmezQxg&t=356.64s)]
