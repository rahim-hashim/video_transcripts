# ‘TRIUMPHANT MOMENT’: Trump greeted by eruptive crowd at UFC in MSG
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU)
*  First of all, Americans have always loved the underdog. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Americans always loved the underdog. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=2.2s)]
*  But if you felt like the system was rigged against you, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=4.0s)]
*  whether it's in your own life, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=7.7s)]
*  in the company that you work for, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  the economy that's not working for you, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=11.64s)]
*  and people in power controlling things [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=13.64s)]
*  and affecting your life, Donald Trump speaks to you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  This is a man who took on the system [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=20.78s)]
*  and now is in power. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=23.98s)]
*  This is, I think, almost like a triumphant moment, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=25.52s)]
*  among the people who actually put him in the office, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=29.62s)]
*  the blue collar workers, the young males. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=32.2s)]
*  This was a moment, and I think it was very American [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=36.0s)]
*  to be in there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=40.56s)]
*  Well, that arena full of voters [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=41.96s)]
*  was just part of the 76,427,168 Americans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=45.1s)]
*  who voted for Donald Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=51.54s)]
*  It's a record, the most ever, by a Republican. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=52.78s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoefAIX9xHU&t=56.019999999999996s)]
