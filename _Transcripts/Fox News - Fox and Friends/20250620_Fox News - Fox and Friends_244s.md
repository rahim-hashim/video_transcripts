# Trump celebrates 'BIG WIN' over Gavin Newsom with latest court ruling
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4)
*  All right in other news it was a big win for Donald Trump right, Griff? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=0.0s)]
*  That's right out in California the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This is a very liberal court mind you the panel finding that the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=3.6s)]
*  President was correct. He has the authority to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=11.44s)]
*  deploy the National Guard and they really were unanimous in deciding this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=15.48s)]
*  simply saying that their review of it is that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=22.04s)]
*  Under US Code 10 the President has the authority to deploy the National Guard when regular forces aren't able to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=25.48s)]
*  enforce US law. Here's the truth social post big one of the Ninth Court of Appeals on the President's core power to call in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=34.4s)]
*  National Guard the judges obviously realize that Gavin Newscombe is incompetent and ill-prepared [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  But this is as much bigger than Gavin because all over the United States in our cities and our people need protection [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=46.0s)]
*  We are the ones to give it to them should state and local police be unable for whatever reason to get the job done [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=52.0s)]
*  This is a great decision for our country and we will continue to protect and defend [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=57.28s)]
*  law-abiding citizens [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=62.36s)]
*  Congratulations to the Ninth [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=64.0s)]
*  America is proud now keep in mind too. That's a message to Chicago to Seattle to Portland [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=65.4s)]
*  Because if you your city loses control I now have constitutionally [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=70.68s)]
*  I have the go-ahead to go in there with my men and women in the National Guard [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=74.44s)]
*  I'll take them from you and use them to protect your city [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=78.88s)]
*  This is what he felt as though maybe he could have done better in his last term when things went crazy after the George Floyd riots [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=82.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, they're called the National Guard and the President United States is the ruler of the nation [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=89.28s)]
*  So he has made a decision to send in the National Guards to LA after those protests. It was getting so [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=94.72s)]
*  Unruly, it was very dangerous people in the community had to shut down their businesses because there were ice needs some protection [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=101.02s)]
*  Absolutely ice was was arresting [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=107.16s)]
*  illegal immigrants who were criminals and so people were upset about it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  They needed more protection Gavin Newsom wasn't doing the job. So President Trump sent in more troops [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  That's a good point easily. It's important to note that ice says [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=120.28s)]
*  75 percent of those people that they're arresting have criminal records many of them violent [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Gavin Newsom is not backing down [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  He's firing back tweeting this saying Donald Trump is not a king and not above the law tonight [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=132.72s)]
*  The court rightly rejected Trump's claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=138.84s)]
*  Court we will not let this authoritarian use of military soldiers against citizens go unchecked [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=146.18s)]
*  He's he's on the wrong side of the courts. Not even a liberal Ninth Circuit Court is gonna take his side [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=153.6s)]
*  Maybe he just sees a political gain out of it and he's doubling down [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=160.38s)]
*  I just can't wait for his sub stack column where he can expand on it and overcome the noise is that or his podcast [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=163.74s)]
*  I've never seen a governor. So just interested in being governor while being governor [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=169.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, they did do a Fox poll and the 47 percent approve of the National Guard's presence in these cities [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=173.94s)]
*  52% are against it. So polling wise it's not as popular when asked about who's got favorable opinion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=180.9s)]
*  Donald Trump's got more favorable [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=189.22s)]
*  45 to Gavin Newsom's 39 so it might not be the most popular thing for the general for the population [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=191.22s)]
*  I think it's absolutely necessary for the cities and for the small businesses [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=197.1s)]
*  However, the National Guard does have to sit with federal buildings. Think about this you have new in New Jersey. We have escaped [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=202.1s)]
*  illegal immigrants in a facility they get out they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=210.1s)]
*  They may finally realize they're on the land they report themselves to these two escaped criminals [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=213.88s)]
*  They report themselves to the state cops. The state cop says we will not bring you back to the facility [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  We were told not to cooperate with ICE. That's how bad it is. We have law enforcement not supporting law enforcement [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=224.1s)]
*  That's why you need the National Guard. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian kill me [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzdV1z9ggE4&t=232.08s)]
