# Harris is either ‘financially illiterate’ or she thinks voters are: Grant Cardone
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris proposing up to $25,000 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=0.0s)]
*  in down payment support for first-time home buyers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=4.96s)]
*  But President Trump says policies like this [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=8.8s)]
*  will destroy our country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=11.0s)]
*  What they're doing is a communist takeover [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=13.44s)]
*  of our country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=16.52s)]
*  Her plan is very dangerous [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=17.88s)]
*  because it may sound good politically, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=19.48s)]
*  and that's the problem. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=21.84s)]
*  And we have to be very careful, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  because when somebody gets up and says, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=25.16s)]
*  we're gonna give you everything, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=26.88s)]
*  $25,000 for a house. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=28.04s)]
*  We're gonna give you all sorts of little goodies, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=30.6s)]
*  free healthcare, we're gonna give you everything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=32.68s)]
*  This is communist, this is Marxist, this is fascist. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=34.64s)]
*  And Kamala Harris also makes no mention [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=38.84s)]
*  of the crippling interest rates, how high they are. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  The current average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=43.32s)]
*  is nearly 6.5%. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  That is up 133% since the Biden-Harris administration [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  took over. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=53.36s)]
*  CEO of Cardone Ventures, Grant Cardone joins us now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Good morning, Grant. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=57.64s)]
*  And good morning to you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=59.2s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=60.04s)]
*  How will we afford this? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=60.88s)]
*  25,000, if you're a first-time homeowner, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=62.4s)]
*  we're gonna pay for all illegals [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=64.88s)]
*  that come across our border, their healthcare. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=66.48s)]
*  We're gonna make everyone pay into this, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=68.68s)]
*  into a single system healthcare. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=71.0s)]
*  How will we afford this? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=73.36s)]
*  Plus, they're paying for college tuition. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=74.4s)]
*  Yeah, Ainsley, look, Kamala Harris [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=77.56s)]
*  is either financially illiterate [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=80.28s)]
*  or she believes her audience is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  This is called come on marketing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  The $25,000 credit is a come on. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  It will not happen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=89.2s)]
*  The $6,000 child credit requires you to have two kids [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=90.44s)]
*  in the same year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  That's a come on. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=94.16s)]
*  The 4 million homes that she came out with yesterday [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=95.28s)]
*  in four years is absolutely impossible in this country. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  And to control prices is a come on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=103.04s)]
*  This is a marketing strategy, a gimmick [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  where there's a promise of an offer [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=107.76s)]
*  that cannot be delivered at scale. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  It's typically used as a bait and switch, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=112.4s)]
*  some kind of offer that exaggerates, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=114.8s)]
*  that has hidden costs, exaggerated claims. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=117.72s)]
*  And she is, Kamala Harris is the come on queen now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=120.64s)]
*  That should be her new title. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  What's required for a first time homeowner? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  I know you told our producers earlier [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=128.72s)]
*  that it takes a lot more than $25,000. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=130.12s)]
*  Yeah, look, $25,000 credits are already being delivered [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=133.44s)]
*  by builders, by the way. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=136.6s)]
*  So the government doesn't need to do this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=137.84s)]
*  The builder is willing to do it today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=139.72s)]
*  But even if you could do that, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=141.8s)]
*  the average loan today is over $400,000. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=143.8s)]
*  The average cost of a home is 440. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=147.24s)]
*  So even if you gave a credit, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  the first time home buyer does not have the down payment, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  $32,000 on average this year is the down payment, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=154.0s)]
*  much less the ability to maintain the house, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=158.52s)]
*  to take care of the insurance, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  which could be as high as $1,000 a month, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  the HOA fees and the property taxes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  So while she says she'll give 25,000 away, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=168.96s)]
*  it's like the car dealer that says, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=172.6s)]
*  look, the payments are gonna be $90 a month [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=173.96s)]
*  and no money down, but you get there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=176.92s)]
*  and you leave with a five or $600 payment. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=178.84s)]
*  It's impossible to deliver like the American Rescue Plan [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=181.04s)]
*  and the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=185.16s)]
*  that delivered nothing to this country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=187.24s)]
*  It was $3.2 trillion. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=189.4s)]
*  That could have built 8 million homes [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  or it could have provided 48 million black households [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=194.44s)]
*  with $300,000 in cash, but that didn't happen either. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  Grant, thank you so much for putting, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=202.08s)]
*  giving us your perspective. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=204.8s)]
*  We appreciate you waking up early for us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=205.76s)]
*  Yeah, you got it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=207.72s)]
*  Thank you, Angie. Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=208.56s)]
*  Have a good one. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef76SJ5EYg&t=209.38s)]
