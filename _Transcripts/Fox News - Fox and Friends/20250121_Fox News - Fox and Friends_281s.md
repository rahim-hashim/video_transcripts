# DOGE sued MINUTES after Trump is sworn in
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI)
*  Hours after Donald Trump was actually President of the United States, we find out that Elon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=0.0s)]
*  Musk and his Doge is being sued. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=6.04s)]
*  They say they violate, in three separate lawsuits, their transparency law and don't like the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=8.52s)]
*  hiring practices. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Here to make sense of it is Greg Jarrett. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Legally, Doge is a problem when a guy gets paid zero dollars in order to streamline government [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=16.52s)]
*  and just make suggestions on how it's going to be done? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=21.6s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=24.68s)]
*  By the way, it's like Miami Beach here because you turn on the air conditioning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=26.32s)]
*  Wow, this is... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  We open up the... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=32.24s)]
*  It's so hot here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=33.24s)]
*  Right, I know. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=34.24s)]
*  He's being sarcastic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=35.24s)]
*  But let's talk about what Elon Musk is thinking now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=36.24s)]
*  Does he have to put this whole thing on hold? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=39.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, this is a premature lawsuit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=40.8s)]
*  It was actually filed before Trump, as you saw there, signed the executive order, creating [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=44.28s)]
*  Doge. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=48.8s)]
*  It's basically bureaucrats who object to cutting out wasteful spending. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=50.559999999999995s)]
*  This is the most bloated bureaucracy in world history. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Bureaucrats don't want to lose their jobs, so they want to keep the government waste [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=63.36s)]
*  in there because it offers them full employment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=67.12s)]
*  They're suing, based on a 53-year-old law, that says, well, if it's an advisory committee [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=70.64s)]
*  to the government, it has to be fully transparent and it must be balanced. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=76.98s)]
*  You have to have bureaucrats on the advisory committee, which is utter nonsense. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=81.98s)]
*  I don't think the lawsuit will succeed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  It depends on how Doge is constructed, and we don't know yet. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=92.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's beginning to set up areas of responsibility to study in the government, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  and then he's going to come up with some suggestions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  But if you see the way Elon Musk operates, he doesn't just have great ideas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=104.98s)]
*  He actually has great systems. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  He understands manufacturing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=112.3s)]
*  He understands workforce load. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  He just studies this as much as he does the science and the physics behind some of his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=115.92s)]
*  creations. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=121.66s)]
*  So he is reallyâ€”I didn't realize until I read the book by Walter Isaacson how perfectly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=122.66s)]
*  built he is to do just this in government. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=127.38s)]
*  Yeah, he's obviously a skilled, brilliant guy, an entrepreneur extraordinaire, and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=130.33999999999997s)]
*  I think we need those kinds of skills on a Doge committee to cut trillions of dollars [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=135.42s)]
*  in wasteful spending and costly regulations. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  If you leave it up to bureaucrats, they'll increase the debt and deficit. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=146.1s)]
*  All right, just so I pay your fee, I want to get some more legal advice from you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=151.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=155.61999999999998s)]
*  Birthright citizenship. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=156.61999999999998s)]
*  He signed an executive order getting rid of it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=158.1s)]
*  So if your parents are here illegally and they give birth to a kid, that kid isn't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=160.22s)]
*  American if that kid is born here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=165.02s)]
*  He wants to end that, and he signed an EO to do that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=167.46s)]
*  Has he done that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=172.1s)]
*  Well, the EO orders it done, and almost immediately he was sued. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  And so this will be tested in the court. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=181.06s)]
*  Look, it's an uphill battle. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=182.9s)]
*  The 14th Amendment gives citizenships to people who are born here and subject to the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=184.78s)]
*  jurisdiction of the United States. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=193.06s)]
*  That's the phrase that Trump is going to test, arguing this is not what the framers intended. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  People here illegally and fraudulently are not necessarily subject to the jurisdiction [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=202.82s)]
*  and the laws of the United States because they shouldn't be here in the first place. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=208.4s)]
*  So they shouldn't receive the benefit and government welfare, taxpayer-funded health [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=213.22s)]
*  care, passports, Social Security numbers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=219.42s)]
*  They should be removed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=223.62s)]
*  I do think it's an uphill battle because the Supreme Court in the past has been pretty [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=225.26s)]
*  clear that if you're born in the United States, regardless of your circumstance, you're a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=230.02s)]
*  citizen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=236.82s)]
*  Our founding fathers are looking to fill out the country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=237.82s)]
*  We wanted people for any way, shape or form, and we have a different mindset now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=240.72s)]
*  But the 14th Amendment was to give citizenship to formerly enslaved people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=244.32s)]
*  That was the original intent, ratified immediately after the Civil War. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=249.76s)]
*  So there's going to be a great debate and discussion here about the original intent [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=254.36s)]
*  of the framers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=259.12s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=260.12s)]
*  Let's have that debate because it's something we should keep politics out of and decide [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=261.12s)]
*  what's best for the country. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=265.14s)]
*  Great, great to see you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=266.14s)]
*  Let's hit the beach and the surf behind us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=267.14s)]
*  That's what he wants to do. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqi2E4PWqI&t=268.88s)]
