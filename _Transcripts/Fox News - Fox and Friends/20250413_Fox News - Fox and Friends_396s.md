# Roaring UFC crowd welcomes Trump, chanting 'USA!' #ufc314 #trump #elonmusk #ufc
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0)
*  Last night, President Trump held a basically a cabinet meeting at a UFC fight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=0.0s)]
*  He took an entire entourage, including Dana White, down in Miami to the UFC fight, brought [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=6.4s)]
*  his granddaughter Kai, who's a great golfer, was not at the match. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=15.84s)]
*  She's University of Miami. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=18.96s)]
*  Yeah, I bet they were watching the master today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=19.96s)]
*  University of Miami signee to play golf. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=22.28s)]
*  I mean, she is an elite, elite golfer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=25.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=27.48s)]
*  And she has a huge following of her own among young people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=29.28s)]
*  My kids, that's who they would want to meet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=32.12s)]
*  My girls, they want to meet Kai. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=34.08s)]
*  But listen, you're absolutely right. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=36.28s)]
*  He brought some cabinet members with him as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=38.32s)]
*  And he gets this rock star welcoming from every time he goes to UFC. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=42.28s)]
*  To me, guys, this is Trump has taken back sports. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=47.24s)]
*  I was with him at the NCAA wrestling, the Super Bowl, the reception that he is getting, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  the Georgia, Alabama football game. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=57.56s)]
*  Look at this as he's walking in. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  Oh, look, and Curb Your Enthusiasm fans who may not otherwise care. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard's there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=66.0s)]
*  Marco's there because he's in Florida as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=67.16s)]
*  Oh, this is just badass, man. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=69.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=71.92s)]
*  And here's the deal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=72.92s)]
*  It's authentic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=73.92s)]
*  When Donald Trump comes in, he loves these fighters. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=74.92s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=77.44s)]
*  He likes warriors and he talks about them, not as athletes, but as warriors. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=79.04s)]
*  Listen to the crowd. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=83.72s)]
*  Listen to the reception he gets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=84.72s)]
*  We're in the entrance right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=88.56s)]
*  To extend to the Russia, the 47th president of the United States of America, by the way, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=92.56s)]
*  the president of the United States, Dana White, and others, Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=100.56s)]
*  So there you see him with Dana White. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=112.56s)]
*  And Dana White actually was on Fox last night on Larry Trump's excellent show. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=114.12s)]
*  And he talked about what we talked about yesterday, which was Bill Maher getting to meet Donald [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=119.12s)]
*  Trump in person via their mutual friend, Kid Rock. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=125.12s)]
*  And just how, as we all know, because we know the president, we've met him, we also know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=129.12s)]
*  people who are wary of the president or think they don't like the president, and then they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=134.12s)]
*  meet the president and they like him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=138.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=140.12s)]
*  Or we know people and we go, I wish you could meet him because he's not the guy you think [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=141.12s)]
*  he is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=143.12s)]
*  Here's Dana White talking about that phenomenon around Donald Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=144.12s)]
*  So the first thing that happens is Bill Maher walks into the Oval Office and me and the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=150.12s)]
*  president were in there and he has a piece of paper with every name that the president [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=155.12s)]
*  has called him over the last however many years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=161.12s)]
*  There were like 100 names on this list. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=163.12s)]
*  And it was hilarious. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=166.12s)]
*  Thank God he had two of them because I had them both sign it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=167.12s)]
*  And I'm getting framed and hanging at my office. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=170.12s)]
*  But I think the coolest thing about that meeting and that dinner was two guys who have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=172.12s)]
*  not liked each other for a very long time, two guys who have many opposing views, got [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=179.12s)]
*  together and sat down and talked and they talked about a lot of things that they agree [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=183.12s)]
*  on and a lot of things that they disagree on. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=188.12s)]
*  But Kid Rock and I always say, and you know this better than anybody, nobody walks into [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=191.12s)]
*  a meeting or a dinner with Donald Trump and walks out and doesn't like him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=196.12s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=200.12s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=201.12s)]
*  And if you say you don't, you're lying. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=202.12s)]
*  It's the charm vortex. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=204.12s)]
*  You fall into the charm vortex. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=206.12s)]
*  It's 100% true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=207.12s)]
*  And I think this is so important the way that people are responding in the sports universe. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=209.12s)]
*  Trump was controversial in 2016. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=214.12s)]
*  ESPN tried to turn him into an awful human being. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=217.12s)]
*  Minner over it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=220.12s)]
*  He had his golf tournaments canceled. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=221.12s)]
*  Remember the golf tournaments were canceled. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=223.12s)]
*  And ESPN had employees calling him a white supremacist. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=225.12s)]
*  I mean, and now when you, they have to first of all cover him walking in with a rock star [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=229.12s)]
*  reception. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=234.12s)]
*  I mean, that was ESPN video that we were playing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=235.12s)]
*  But I think it's symptomatic. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=237.12s)]
*  Look at all this of America healing and people chanting USA and just wanting to be coming [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=239.12s)]
*  together, which is the best thing about sports. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=246.12s)]
*  You don't really necessarily think about politics and you'd like to respect the president and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=248.12s)]
*  feels like we're there again. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=252.12s)]
*  That's so interesting because you say that Dana White alluded to that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=254.12s)]
*  You know, we had Joe Biden was supposed to be the unity president, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=257.12s)]
*  There was no unity during that time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=261.12s)]
*  We had we had conservatives put in jail thrown in jail. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=263.12s)]
*  We had all kinds of crazy stuff. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=266.12s)]
*  Is this a unity? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=268.12s)]
*  Is this the next four years? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=270.12s)]
*  Is the Bill Maher convention here at the White House? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=271.12s)]
*  This is the this is the unifier that no one saw coming. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=275.12s)]
*  But what's really interesting about it, and I know a lot of like sports guys who don't care about politics. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=279.12s)]
*  They care about sports and they you know, they I mean, they care about politics. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=283.12s)]
*  They care about, you know, government and stuff like that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=286.12s)]
*  But their real focus is just not that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=289.12s)]
*  But they've been whatever it is, red pilled or blackpilled or whatever. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=292.12s)]
*  And to think about where the credibility, you know, who lost all the credibility and all that? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=296.12s)]
*  The media. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=302.12s)]
*  They will never believe anything the media ever tells them ever again. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=303.12s)]
*  And the Democrat Party. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=307.12s)]
*  I mean, and for a lot of these people sitting watching the UFC fight, you know, they have men fight men and women fight women. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=308.12s)]
*  The idea that a man would identify as a woman and be able to fight a UFC. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=314.12s)]
*  Yeah. Men are over it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=319.12s)]
*  We're done with the with the ridiculousness. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=320.12s)]
*  And I think that's kind of symbolic. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=322.12s)]
*  Daytona 500 Super Bowl wrestling championships, the UFC overwhelming cheering, maybe the WNBA All-Star game. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=324.12s)]
*  They wouldn't like. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=331.12s)]
*  And I'm a I'm a fool. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=332.12s)]
*  But everywhere else, he's got a one. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=333.12s)]
*  And I'm a political spouse. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=335.12s)]
*  I'm a political spouse. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=337.12s)]
*  So I'm attuned to what that can be like. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=338.12s)]
*  It's always treacherous for a politician to enter into a sports arena with a mixed crowd. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=341.12s)]
*  A lot of them, as you said, apolitical and overwhelmingly, people resonate with the fact that, A, he embraces his masculinity and B, he's a warrior himself. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=348.12s)]
*  That's why he relates to athletes in that way. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=358.12s)]
*  So quickly, remember, at the NCAA wrestling championship, every wrestler came over to shake his hand. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=361.12s)]
*  To your point, Rachel, they had no idea how they were going to react because it's unscripted. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=367.12s)]
*  All of them were phenomenal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=371.12s)]
*  And again, that story, young men in particular have broken Trump. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=373.12s)]
*  And I think you see it with these crowds every single day. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=377.12s)]
*  But none of unscripted. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=379.12s)]
*  That is actually the key to Donald Trump. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=381.12s)]
*  Yes. I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=385.12s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1aNYH6cj0&t=386.12s)]
