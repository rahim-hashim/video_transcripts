# Former Biden supporter: This is why we need Trump in 2024
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0)
*  So a live look in Chicago where the DNC kicks off tomorrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=0.0s)]
*  Despite VP Kamala Harris revealing just one of her platforms, and some Democrats say they're [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=7.04s)]
*  willing to wait for the rest, telling Politico, quote, they'd rather lay out a specific plan [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=11.96s)]
*  post-November when a potential president-elect Harris would have to staff up her administration [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=18.0s)]
*  and determine her governing priorities. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Our next guest led an effort for Biden to run in 2016 and later advised Bernie Sanders, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=27.2s)]
*  but left the Democratic Party last year and switched to become a Republican. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=32.68s)]
*  Will Pierce joins us now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=36.32s)]
*  So let's, I want to get to your story eventually, but the Democratic Party is saying in Politico [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=38.6s)]
*  that we may not know everything about Kamala Harris, but let's elect her first, and then [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=44.32s)]
*  she'll tell us what she's about. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  And that's first of all, thanks for having me on, but that's ridiculous. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=50.8s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=53.72s)]
*  She's been vice president for how many years? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=54.72s)]
*  She's been the border czar. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=56.44s)]
*  We know her record. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  If you want to look at her record, you look at California. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  If you want to know Walz's record, you look at Minnesota as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=60.76s)]
*  You see all the terrible things that they've done. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=63.28s)]
*  If you want to look as well at the Democratic record, right now we're in Chicago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  You have terrible crime going on. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=68.32s)]
*  You have the legal immigration running rampant around the city while the citizens are not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=69.64s)]
*  being taken care of. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=74.52s)]
*  Yeah, so tell me about this, because when it comes to the Democratic Party, it looks [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=75.52s)]
*  like a lot of brothers, a lot of black voters are leaving, black male voters are leaving [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=79.86s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=85.08s)]
*  What do you think is the number one issue? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=86.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=89.24s)]
*  Too many issues, I think. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=90.24s)]
*  But I think overall the thing is like, I think the tipping point was if you look at the legal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=91.24s)]
*  immigration issue going on, you see all the federal funding and all the state and all [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=95.52s)]
*  the local funding. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=99.88s)]
*  I was just here, I heard recently that in New York City they spent upwards of three [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=100.88s)]
*  to five billion dollars in overall just with the legal immigration. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  But then at the same time, look at our brothers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=108.4s)]
*  We do not have jobs. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=110.6s)]
*  Look at our communities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=111.6s)]
*  We do not have funding. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=112.6s)]
*  We elected Democrats over and over and over again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=113.68s)]
*  And what did they say? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Oh no, we'll take care of you next time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  We'll take care of you next time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  We'll help the community next time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  But then they're not doing that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  Why is Trump different real quick? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  Overall, look at what he's done. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=124.12s)]
*  If you look at his record from day one, he's brought African Americans into the administration. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=125.48s)]
*  As well, he's a businessman. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=130.32s)]
*  Myself, I own a business. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=131.32s)]
*  He knows what it's like to have to sit there and do payroll as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=135.4s)]
*  Will Pierce, thank you so much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=136.4s)]
*  Strong words this morning. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTa32ZQwqO0&t=137.4s)]
