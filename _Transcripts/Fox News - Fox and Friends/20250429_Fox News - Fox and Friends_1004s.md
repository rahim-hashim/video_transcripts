# Judge Jeanine calls for judge to 'lose robe' after allegedly aiding criminal migrant
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4)
*  Today president Trump marks 100 days in office with the promise no one is above the law, especially those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=0.0s)]
*  supposed to be [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Upholding the law a new executive order targeting sanctuary cities signed yesterday [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=8.84s)]
*  Just days after a Wisconsin judge was arrested accused of helping an illegal evade ice [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=14.08s)]
*  You're gonna react the five co-hosts judge Janine Pirro. Welcome to the judge [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=19.84s)]
*  Judge we just got to get to because you're a former judge. I used to work for a judge two judges [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=30.16s)]
*  Actually the thought of another judge [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=34.36s)]
*  Letting the criminal out of the back door or any officer of the court was just appalling to me [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=37.08s)]
*  Can she be really prosecuted for this? It's not only appalling. It's illegal. Let me make this very clear [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  These judges just because you put a robe on doesn't mean that you are protected and somehow are not [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=48.84s)]
*  Responsible for violating the law it's called obstruction of justice [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=56.04s)]
*  It's called interfering with an arrest and what this judge did was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=60.08s)]
*  Unbelievable. There was a domestic violence case in her courtroom [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=65.2s)]
*  Two women were in court ready to testify with the prosecutor [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=69.56s)]
*  What the judge does she hears ices in the courthouse? She gets furious [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=74.48s)]
*  She goes out and confronts them [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=79.44s)]
*  She wants to protect the illegal who's charged with battering and who knows what else and she then says [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you guys you go see the chief administrative judge that way and as she directs him that way [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=88.8s)]
*  She takes the criminal out the back door [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=95.56s)]
*  It's not a public way of leaving or entering the courthouse [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=98.88s)]
*  So she is obstructing and she is creating a danger for the public [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=102.28s)]
*  How because law enforcement then has to make an arrest in the public area and putting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  Citizens at risk in addition to the cops this judge should not only be prosecuted [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  She should lose her robe [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=118.28s)]
*  She knows better than anyone what the law is and for her to think she has the right to let a criminal go free [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=120.0s)]
*  And what I want to know is what other illegals have you let go free? This is a domestic violence case [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=126.64s)]
*  I want to know what is your record? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=133.4s)]
*  What have you done to the prosecutors who come into your courtroom and try to prosecute real cases? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  Enough with this judge people say like other channels David Brooks says she's heroic acted heroic by doing the right thing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=140.88s)]
*  Well, these people are clueless if the first 100 days of Donald Trump tells us anything [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  It's that the American people voted him in to do exactly what he's doing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=153.56s)]
*  And it's promises made and promises kept in a hundred days [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=158.6s)]
*  And by the way, it's like we have two press conferences a day [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=162.36s)]
*  I mean Joe Biden and he called a lint before he got out of bed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=165.66000000000003s)]
*  I even knew the man was the president even exaggerating today [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  He's gonna have he's gonna have a another cabinet meeting on camera [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure it's gonna be a lot of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  Caroline is gonna have a press conference at 830 with Bessette and then tonight [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=178.52s)]
*  He's doing a rally to celebrate the hundred days in Michigan at 6 o'clock [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=182.68s)]
*  There's no question the man has more energy than anyone. I know any any of us [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=186.08s)]
*  He goes 24 7 he is committed. He's a fighter [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=191.46s)]
*  He's learned that you cannot buckle at all whether it's DEI whether it's men and women's sports [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=195.46s)]
*  Whether it's deporting illegal aliens and these other judges these federal judges who somehow think that because they're a federal judge [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=202.06s)]
*  They have the right to stop the president of the United States and foreign policy decisions foreign terrorist [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=209.62s)]
*  Organization sending out these criminals under the alien enemies act [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=216.62s)]
*  They can't stop that the Supreme Court had to intervene and say you don't do that. You're a local judge in Maryland [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=220.38000000000002s)]
*  I don't care if you're federal you do not dictate presidential policy real quick. It's later today [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=227.78s)]

*  Kristi Noem and Pam Bondi and he said I want to know these cities that are protecting the criminals putting American citizens at risk and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=244.06s)]
*  Making it so that law enforcement is in trouble. Just trying to arrest it by the way [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=252.5s)]
*  If you want to protect criminals protect an American criminal [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=257.02s)]

*  We are sanctuary and welcoming state that that has not changed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  Because of who won the election Donald Trump and his administration Tom Holman people at the Department of Homeland Security [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=314.74s)]
*  They're the ones that are threatening people [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=321.5s)]
*  I still remain opposed to efforts to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=323.62s)]
*  Target large swaths of a documented population. He'd done nothing wrong other than they're here [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=327.97999999999996s)]
*  They're here, but it's hard to argue with the new numbers according to CBP only nine illegal migrants [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=334.97999999999996s)]
*  Nine were released into the United States during President Trump's first 70 days [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=341.94s)]
*  Compare that look at that other number to nearly 5,000 that were released in one day in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=347.78s)]
*  December 2023 under Joe Biden [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=353.78s)]
*  I mean, it's truly incredible borders are Tom Holman joins us right now a round of applause for Tom [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  It was a promise made a promise kept I [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=369.34s)]
*  Mean the proof is in the pudding when it comes to the numbers [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=373.26s)]
*  I know there was a lot of people that tried to say that President Biden was actually deporting more people yesterday [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  You broke it down. That's not true. No, it's not true [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  I saw rest of the interior about three times harder than by the administration was but they were counting border removals [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  With ice removals, and of course, they had a lot of border removals at 10.5 million people come to the border [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=391.3s)]
*  I looked at the numbers the other day under the Biden administration [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  We average about you know, 10 11,000 day the high points some days at 15,000. You know what the number was yesterday [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=399.68s)]
*  178 [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=407.68s)]
*  170 across two two thousand miles of border and you're right [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=409.2s)]
*  Since January the Trump administration released nine people four were material witnesses in the criminal investigation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=413.76s)]
*  We brought them in to testify in a court hearing on a cartel hearing four were in extreme medical distress [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=420.24s)]
*  So we had a movement to emergency medical facilities one was a humanitarian in that same timeframe [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=426.68s)]
*  That we released nine they released a hundred and eighty four thousand illegal aliens in the country [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=433.6s)]
*  So President Trump is a game changer. What's happening on the board? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=438.68s)]
*  He did in seven weeks, but Joe Biden couldn't or wouldn't do in four years [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=442.04s)]
*  What about the terrorist watch list we know under Joe Biden hundreds of them were coming across our border [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=447.88s)]
*  They were on the terror watch list do we know who they are? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=453.41999999999996s)]
*  Are they still here in our country and what what kind of a threat could we expect? Yes [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=455.9s)]
*  There's there's many in the country and we're working with intelligence community FBI try to find him remember [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=459.73999999999995s)]
*  We had over two million known gotaways under Joe Biden [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=464.5s)]
*  Two million people paid more to get away [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=467.41999999999996s)]
*  You pay the cartels a lesser amount of money just to get to the border the cartels job ends at the border [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=470.38s)]
*  I see green uniform and turn yourself in you get released in 24 hours [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=475.38s)]
*  You get a free airline ticket to the city of your choice [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=479.29999999999995s)]
*  You get a free hotel room you get three meals a day [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=481.66s)]
*  You get free medical care and you get work authorization after about 90 days exactly the reason they came [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=484.54s)]
*  Why did two million people pay more not to get not to get all that getaway, right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=489.94s)]
*  Because they didn't want to be vetted they didn't want to be fingerprinted and that scares the hell out of me [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=494.42s)]
*  She's good. Hello everybody. How many of them came from country-sponsored terror, but we've rested 400 [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=498.12s)]
*  Obviously there were morons because terrorists they get trained out of how to evade law enforcement [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  How many had two men were carrying fentanyl or sex trafficking and women children or from a terrorist-related country? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=508.26s)]
*  What Joe Biden did was the biggest national security vulnerability this nation's ever seen Tom [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  It was just a week or two ago that Christina Ohm our Secretary of Homeland Security was in a restaurant in Washington DC [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  She was at a hamburger place with her family [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=526.06s)]
*  Somebody stole her her purse as it turns out the guy who stole her purse in the country illegally [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=528.38s)]
*  He had been arrested essentially doing the same thing here in New York City a couple weeks earlier [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=533.9399999999999s)]
*  But you know, it's a revolving door. They arrest him and then they let him loose [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=540.22s)]
*  Because we're a sanctuary city New York City has that started to change since you've been working with mayor Adams [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah mayor Adams. I was up here last week and we announced the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=551.6999999999999s)]

*  I'm standing on stage and mayor Adams talking about the great success of ice working with NYPD to make New York City much safer [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=567.22s)]
*  The City Council sues to keep me on the records island, right? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=574.46s)]
*  And we just proved to the city how much safer the city is now [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=578.38s)]
*  You got 27 TDA members off the street that were involved with gun trafficking drug trafficking sex trafficking murder for hire [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=582.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a Rico investigation so, you know, they sue to keep out of records iron [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=589.34s)]
*  But I think we're gonna win [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=593.94s)]
*  I think we'll be in the records island mayor Adams has proven he wants to be a law and order mayor and as far as this [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=595.0600000000001s)]
*  Making a trade for getting out of his criminal investigation me or mayor Adams were talking since November [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=600.02s)]
*  Way before this other investigation he was talked about it's just garbage [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=604.82s)]
*  But I think we're you know, he came to the table were doing great things in New York [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=608.64s)]
*  I don't think Chicago is gonna come to the table. You're Chicago told me I wasn't welcome in Chicago [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=612.38s)]
*  Guess the first place I went to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=617.0600000000001s)]
*  Do you believe the Venezuelan sent TDA here to wreak havoc? Yeah, they should think to just getting rid of them [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=620.7s)]
*  Do you think this is a tactic? No, it's a predatory incursion. They came to United States [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=626.62s)]
*  We know they're embedded through numerous investigations or embedded with the Maduro regime [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=630.64s)]
*  They came here to unsettle this country whether it's through the fentanyl kills thousand of the kids sex trafficking or violence in the city [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=636.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean the FBI just did a report saying that TDA members are here to assassinate people in Florida [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=642.64s)]
*  I mean it was a predatory incursion and people say we're not at war. You can't use the AEA or read the act [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=649.52s)]
*  Because you can also do it during predatory incursion and we and we've clearly shown that occurred Tom [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=655.88s)]

*  One of these very popular things the president's done is hired RFK [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=715.92s)]
*  Maybe the second most popular politician in the country to change what we eat and look at chronic diseases [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=719.72s)]
*  How do you feel about the progress he's making so far? You know, first of all, I don't look at RFK jr [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=725.52s)]
*  As a politician I look at him as I mean he is here. This is just not a moment of time [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=730.4s)]
*  This is a movement and the whole make America healthy again is really a movement something that we haven't seen in the United States [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=735.06s)]
*  And it is really just about time that we take it seriously the health of our nation [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=740.64s)]
*  RFK jr. And his team they are already, you know breaking the industry in the sense that he's making us question a lot of things [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=745.92s)]
*  And that's what's really important [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=752.8s)]
*  Having the questions about what we're adding to our foods and the things that we're giving to our children [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=754.84s)]
*  fluorides in our drinking water [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=759.8s)]
*  Talking about some of the medications and the vaccines and looking at the safety all of this [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=761.8s)]
*  Asking these questions and being a disruptor is absolutely essential [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  To getting us to a healthy place again [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  Especially when you look across the world and Europe and other places don't allow a lot of the things that we hear in the United [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=772.8s)]
*  States do allow so the fact that that's the case and that we have one of the unhealthiest populations across the world [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=778.9s)]
*  I think it's great. We're asking these questions. Yeah, I think that a lot of people think they're eating healthy [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=785.5999999999999s)]
*  There's one if you eat bad, you know when you're eating junk food [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  A lot of people think they're eating healthy had no idea about some of the things we've brought up by you [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=791.68s)]
*  Kasey and Kelly means and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=796.6999999999999s)]
*  RFK the other thing the president wanted RFK to tackle is [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  Chronic diseases first and foremost autism and that's where he's starting [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=803.3s)]
*  In fact, here's the headline of the Wall Street Journal the madness in RFK juniors autism method because he's guaranteeing by the way [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=807.02s)]
*  That will have some an answer to why we have the rise in autism by September is this its department [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=813.34s)]
*  Is its department and it's an epidemic it said autism is increasing among kids being 1 in 31 [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=820.08s)]
*  There's now 1 of 31 in 2022 is 1 in 54 in 2016. It was 1 in 150 [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=826.84s)]
*  So why is there more autistic kids in our country? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=832.72s)]
*  Well to discussing the rise in incidence and prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in the United States and and internationally it's very complex [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=836.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not just you know, there's not one reason it's not black and white. Yes [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=843.88s)]
*  It has to do with an expanded diagnosis. We have bigger wider diagnostic criteria [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=847.36s)]
*  We also have more people going seeking help being diagnosed with it [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=852.1400000000001s)]
*  But we also does even with that aside it does seem that there is still a rise in it [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=856.6s)]
*  And why is that we're not gonna have a single answer to it? I guarantee even in September and even in September gosh [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=861.08s)]
*  I wish she didn't give that timeline. I hate putting those kind of restrictions on things, especially when it comes to science [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=866.72s)]
*  We need to make sure people are still asking questions, but there's not gonna be a black and white answer [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  But it is a confluence of environmental toxins. That's all around us as well as some of our genetics [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=875.68s)]
*  I love that he's tackling this and let's go to the audience now Bob. You have a question for the doctor [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=880.6s)]
*  Actually, you just answered my question [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=887.76s)]
*  I'm a father of an autistic son. I have two sons born a year apart in [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  1999 in the year 2000 [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=896.16s)]
*  They both received the MMR vaccine within a year of each other from the same pediatrician [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=897.88s)]
*  And my question to you is what do you feel about our case thoughts on saying that he's gonna say I know what the causes [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=903.06s)]
*  Are for autism by September so you answered the question basically for me already. It's a very complicated topic [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=909.6999999999999s)]
*  Obviously RFK jr. Has been speaking on the MMR vaccine specifically and autism spectrum disorder [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=915.78s)]
*  He's been talking about it for a decade [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=920.98s)]
*  And so it's prudent for the people who support him that he does do it [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=922.1s)]
*  He's promised and to look into this my opinion looking at the overwhelming data and not just the United States data because let me tell you [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=926.06s)]
*  When it comes to the United States we are not good at picking up safety signals [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=932.74s)]
*  When we're seeing something wrong with our medications with our vaccines look what happened in kovat we had to rely on the UK [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=936.78s)]
*  They picked up the safety signal for the blood clots in the blank brain [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=942.6s)]
*  Israel picked up the safety signals for myocarditis mRNA. We completely failed so I'm not just looking at what's happening here in the United States [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=945.86s)]
*  I want to look at everywhere else and overwhelmingly huge studies Denmark Finland UK and the United States show that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=953.3s)]
*  Autism rates do not seem to be linked to the MMR vaccine [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=959.82s)]
*  Now I want them to continue to look for and maybe develop some more studies to look at it [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=963.66s)]
*  But where we stand right now, that's kind of what the data shows [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=968.5400000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that there aren't toxins [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=972.26s)]
*  It doesn't mean that there aren't side effects from these vaccines and those all need to maintain that we continue studying them [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=974.7s)]
*  Looking at the safety and efficacy of what we're giving to our children. Yeah, but I would say this. I love the focus [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=979.82s)]
*  I love these gonna have a series of studies the more focused the more great minds may we'll get some great answers [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=984.74s)]
*  Thanks so much. Dr. Sapphire. I appreciate it. All right, great question, sir. Thank you. I'm Steve juicy [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdTmc2Q1bD4&t=989.62s)]
