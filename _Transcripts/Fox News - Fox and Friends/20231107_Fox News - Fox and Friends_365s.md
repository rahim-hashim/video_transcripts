# Peter Doocy: This is a mess
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8)
*  All right, well, funny you should bring him out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the White House race a little more. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=1.84s)]
*  Florida governor and 2024 presidential candidate [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=3.84s)]
*  Ron DeSantis picking up a major endorsement in Iowa. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=6.54s)]
*  So Peter Deuce is live from the White House [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=10.32s)]
*  with the latest on the 2024 election. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  So what has been the reception so far, Peter, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=14.98s)]
*  of the endorsement? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=17.52s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, and kind of like you guys [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=19.88s)]
*  were just talking about it, every single primary poll [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=22.06s)]
*  has Donald Trump with a huge lead [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=24.76s)]
*  over the rest of the field. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=26.8s)]
*  But nobody has voted yet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=28.04s)]
*  Nobody has caucused yet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=30.2s)]
*  He is not the nominee at this point. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=31.64s)]
*  And there are many high profile Republicans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  trying to make sure that there is someone else who [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=36.68s)]
*  can rise to the top, be the party's standard bearer, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=39.68s)]
*  the latest official, Iowa's governor, Kim Reynolds. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=42.56s)]
*  Someone who most importantly can win, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=47.76s)]
*  and that person is Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=51.86s)]
*  I am so proud to stand here tonight [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=54.84s)]
*  and give him my full support and endorsement [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=58.34s)]
*  for president of the United States of America. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=61.78s)]
*  This is the time of the cycle where [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=66.58s)]
*  we're going to start to figure out [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=67.92s)]
*  how much endorsements matter. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=69.12s)]
*  Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=70.92s)]
*  is going to back her old boss, President Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=72.72s)]
*  And President Biden has been on the road a lot more [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=75.08000000000001s)]
*  with official events than campaign events. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=78.16s)]
*  And he's got a new, very unlikely defender, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=80.4s)]
*  as whispers grow that maybe Biden wouldn't be the guy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=83.46s)]
*  on the ballot next year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=86.52s)]
*  And this person is sticking up for Biden [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  and lashing out at Gavin Newsom. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=91.5s)]
*  Now there are two additional Democrats running [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=96.3s)]
*  for president right now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  One is a congressman from Minnesota. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  The other one is the governor of California. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=108.52s)]
*  They're both running for president, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=113.72s)]
*  but only one had the guts to announce it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  And as President Biden wakes up this morning [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=120.46s)]
*  and looks out the window of the residence, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=122.36s)]
*  if he points out at the street, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  he's going to see that the fence line is still defaced. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=127.16s)]
*  The Park Service was out there yesterday [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=130.64s)]
*  with a pressure washer trying to get that fake blood [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=132.2s)]
*  that these anti-Israel protesters [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=135.38s)]
*  smeared all over the gates on Saturday night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=137.34s)]
*  There are still black tarps covering it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  They apparently have been unsuccessful [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=144.0s)]
*  in getting that mess off the fence line so far. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  Three days later. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=149.24s)]
*  Peter, just your opinion here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=150.68s)]
*  I thought if you touch the White House, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  there'd be guys in black outfits [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=155.84s)]
*  that would wrestle you to the ground. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=157.74s)]
*  I'm stunned they were able to breach the fence, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  defile the perimeter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=162.56s)]
*  I mean, they knew this was 100,000 people in Washington. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=164.62s)]
*  They said to everyone they're marching to the White House. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=168.22s)]
*  Are you surprised, knowing the security like you know it, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=172.2s)]
*  that they were able to do this? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=174.1s)]
*  Yeah, like if I went outside right now [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=175.84s)]
*  to a different fence post with a can of spray paint [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=178.04s)]
*  and I wrote anything on there, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=180.98s)]
*  I would expect to be in handcuffs in about five minutes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=182.76s)]
*  And there might even be a dog biting me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=185.62s)]
*  A Secret Service dog biting at me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=188.76s)]
*  And so at some point, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=190.7s)]
*  and this is a photo that I took with my iPhone [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=193.86s)]
*  on the way in this morning, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=195.6s)]
*  at some point a decision was made [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=196.64s)]
*  not to get these guys off the fence. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=199.02s)]
*  We do see Pennsylvania Avenue closed a lot during the day. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=202.66s)]
*  Somebody drops a backpack, somebody is misbehaving. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=206.62s)]
*  They will clear everybody off Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=209.0s)]
*  A decision was made somewhere in the chain of command, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=211.64s)]
*  not to keep people back [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=214.84s)]
*  and to let this particular demonstration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=217.14s)]
*  come all the way up to the gates. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=218.98s)]
*  But if it's gonna take the National Park Service [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=220.44s)]
*  more than a day to get this paint [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=223.72s)]
*  or whatever the substance is down, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=226.18s)]
*  that's a mess. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=229.52s)]
*  That's a big mess. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=230.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=231.68s)]
*  It's the insult to the country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=232.52s)]
*  Peter, after Russia invaded Ukraine, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  the Russian embassy up on the Upper East Side [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=235.82s)]
*  here in New York was covered in all that red paint too. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=237.82s)]
*  And it took, I mean, I wanna say a month [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=241.1s)]
*  for them to be able to remove it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=244.5s)]
*  And you can still see some of it on there [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=246.06s)]
*  because it's like a stucco material or cement. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=247.66s)]
*  And I don't know what they're using, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=251.22s)]
*  but it takes a long time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=252.54s)]
*  And they have to get the right company. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=253.82s)]
*  You would think if you're the White House, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=255.38s)]
*  you would have that cleaned up quickly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=256.86s)]
*  And Peter, it wasn't just the paint. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=259.2s)]
*  I saw them with the end of flags [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=260.24s)]
*  poking through the gate of the White House barrier. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=263.08s)]
*  Yeah, and yesterday it looked like there were, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=266.42s)]
*  as you look down the fence line, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=269.5s)]
*  there was a lot of stuff that was glued [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=270.68s)]
*  to the individual iron bars. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=272.12s)]
*  And a lot of that looks like it's been removed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=274.44s)]
*  But when you have part of the White House [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=276.64s)]
*  that's draped in a black tarp, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=279.24s)]
*  it almost has the look of like a state funeral [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=282.02s)]
*  or like they're mourning something. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=285.8s)]
*  But it's really just because they are cleaning up [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=287.86s)]
*  this big mess that was left behind [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=289.5s)]
*  by these anti-Israel protesters. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=290.92s)]
*  They're embarrassed by it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  Peter, you said that if you went out [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=295.7s)]
*  with a can of spray paint, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=297.38s)]
*  Peter, you said if you went out with a can of spray paint, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  you would be arrested, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=302.74s)]
*  but also a dog might be biting you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  You said the Secret Service dog. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=306.86s)]
*  There's always a possibility it could be the Biden's dog. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=308.86s)]
*  Hey, there's that doosie kid. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=311.82s)]
*  Commander was exiled. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=314.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1T_Qp6Djm8&t=315.9s)]
