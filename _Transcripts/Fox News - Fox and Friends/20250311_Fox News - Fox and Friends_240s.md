# 'SERIOUSLY?!': Dems mocked for new meltdowns over Elon Musk
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8)
*  All right, it's a busy day on Capitol Hill as the House will vote on a new spending bill to avoid a government shutdown [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=0.0s)]
*  Without it a shutdown will happen midnight Friday and Democrats seem dead set on forcing that to happen [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=5.4s)]
*  Here with more on what we can expect House Republican conference chair Congresswoman Lisa McLean. Good morning Congresswoman [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Hey, good morning. How are you? It's good to have you on the program [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=20.16s)]
*  So we've been following every single action from the house. It looks like [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=23.84s)]
*  Every single vote it is very close when it comes to these spending bills [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  Do you have the votes right now to avoid a shutdown and pass the budget? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=33.28s)]
*  Listen I am an optimist by nature [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=39.64s)]
*  I believe we're gonna get this CR done president Trump has been very clear about what he wants for his agenda [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=41.84s)]
*  JD Vance is coming to our conference today just to make sure that everyone is clear on what our vision and what our agenda is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=48.8s)]
*  So I'm extremely optimistic that we're gonna get this done today [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=56.68s)]
*  I mean the CR as it is right now is clean [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=60.31999999999999s)]
*  It freezes spending levels and most importantly it gives us time to put forward the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=64.16s)]
*  transformational agenda that 77 million Americans gave us a mandate for in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=71.96s)]
*  November, so I think it'll be a little you know touch-and-go [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day we'll get it done because the Republicans want to make sure that we make [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=81.82s)]
*  Transformational change and keep the government open. Do you anticipate? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=88.7s)]
*  Getting some votes from the Democrats though [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=94.06s)]
*  You know, I really don't want to count on the Democrats for anything right now other than their fear-mongering in their lives [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=99.06s)]
*  So we are we our strategy is we are gonna pass this with Republican votes [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=104.9s)]
*  Now my hope would be that the Democrats would join us in keeping the government open and funded [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  Remember, these are the people that always you know tell we can't shut the government down and if we shut the government down [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=117.86s)]
*  Oh my goodness gracious, you know, no one's gonna get their Social Security benefits now [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=124.38s)]
*  They're the ones out there who actually want to shut the government down [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=128.7s)]
*  So we'll see if any Democrats come to their senses or not, but I don't count on it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=132.66s)]
*  Congresswoman we've been seeing a lot of protests [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=137.66s)]
*  On Capitol Hill outside of you guys office buildings the protesting Doge [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=139.94s)]
*  They're saying this is a corrupt process, but this is something that the president ran on right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=145.14s)]
*  Yeah, he did and different than our previous administration if our president tells you gonna do he's gonna do something [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  He actually does it but just for a moment think of what the Democrats are actually protesting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  They're protesting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=164.38s)]
*  transparency they are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=166.66s)]
*  protesting how dare you Republicans go in there and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=168.66s)]
*  uncover waste fraud and abuse the Democrats like the bloated bureaucracy just think for one moment what we're [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=172.82s)]
*  Uncovering and the money that we're uncovering that we can save through the waste fraud and abuse [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=181.42s)]
*  Those dollars can actually be used for the people who? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=187.34s)]
*  Vulnerable who are most vulnerable that need these programs the most that'll be more money to actually [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=192.5s)]
*  Use for people who need it the most and that's what the Democrats are protesting seriously [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=198.7s)]
*  Well, we saw them sit on their tails when you had a young boy that was struggling with cancer [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=204.5s)]
*  I was honored by the president of the United States when we captured the guy that killed 13 of our soldiers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=209.98s)]
*  So I'm not optimistic when it comes to them when it comes to this bill congresswoman. Thanks so much for getting up this morning [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWNbR9Uv8Q8&t=216.18s)]
