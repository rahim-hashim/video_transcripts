# John Daly: Our country needs daddy Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ)
*  Has anybody checked on Hollywood celebrities yet? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=0.0s)]
*  After celebrity support comes up short for Kamala Harris, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=2.2s)]
*  a group called a growing chorus of stars and pro athletes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=5.84s)]
*  are reeling from Donald Trump's historic victory. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=9.72s)]
*  But our next guest is one pro who has always been Team Trump, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  PGA golfer John Daly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=16.76s)]
*  The legendary John Daly joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=18.84s)]
*  So John, were you surprised when you heard about the results? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I mean, a complete landslide. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=24.16s)]
*  For now, the former president Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=26.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=28.88s)]
*  I was praying that he'd win. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=29.68s)]
*  I just didn't know it was going to be that big. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=30.44s)]
*  But I just think America's tired of what's been going on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=32.0s)]
*  for the last four years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=34.44s)]
*  You posted on X. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=36.36s)]
*  Historic. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=37.92s)]
*  Welcome back, Mr. President. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=38.68s)]
*  Cheers to getting our country back. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=40.28s)]
*  What was the reaction? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=42.36s)]
*  I lost a lot of followers, but I gained a hundred times more. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=45.0s)]
*  You know, I think our country needs Daddy Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=49.2s)]
*  And what he did when he became president, our 45th, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=53.24s)]
*  what he did for four years was a miracle. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=57.52s)]
*  He got us out of a lot of things. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=60.52s)]
*  And all he wants to do is protect our country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=62.92s)]
*  It's like we want to protect our kids and our family. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=65.36s)]
*  Daddy Trump wants to protect America [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  and he's going to do it again. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=70.88s)]
*  You've known him since 92. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=72.2s)]
*  You've always called him that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=73.2s)]
*  How did you first run into him? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=74.84s)]
*  Because of the golf world? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we were playing in a pro-am in Massachusetts in 92 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=78.36s)]
*  and he played the pro-am with me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=82.92s)]
*  I got to know him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=84.04s)]
*  We sat on the back porch for about four hours [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=85.28s)]
*  and you know, I'm drinking Jack Daniels and Diet Cokes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=88.6s)]
*  and he's drinking Diet Cokes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=92.44s)]
*  And we talked and he loves golf. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=94.2s)]
*  He is passionate about golf. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=97.68s)]
*  But when he got up, he says, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  one day I'll be the president of the United States. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=100.92s)]
*  And that was in 1992. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=102.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=104.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=105.88s)]
*  And then you watched it happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=106.72s)]
*  So what is your recommendation to people [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  that just can't get over this loss? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=110.92s)]
*  Celebrities that put their life on the line, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=112.6s)]
*  Cardi B doesn't want to talk to anybody [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=115.28s)]
*  that voted for Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=117.28s)]
*  What's your advice? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  It goes back to protecting our family. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=122.28s)]
*  You got to protect our borders. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=124.56s)]
*  You got to protect the American citizens. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=126.28s)]
*  You got to protect the family [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  before you can protect anybody else. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=128.96s)]
*  And that's what daddy wants to do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=131.04s)]
*  What's going on, the Venezuela gangs in Colorado [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=133.2s)]
*  taking over apartments and people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=136.76s)]
*  and immigrants taking over hotels and stuff. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  And you got to protect the family [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=141.12s)]
*  and that's America. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=144.16s)]
*  Protect them first and then we can worry about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=145.4s)]
*  a lot of other stuff outside of the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  But daddy Trump's all about America [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=150.96s)]
*  and his common sense. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=153.92s)]
*  Protect the ones that live in our country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=155.12s)]
*  And he's just an amazing human being. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=158.72s)]
*  The whole family's amazing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=161.2s)]
*  All they want to do is protect us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=162.44s)]
*  Have you talked to him since he became president-elect? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=164.04s)]
*  We've been texting a little bit. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=167.64s)]
*  I didn't want to bother him, but I just love him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  People who don't know the Trump family [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=173.36s)]
*  are the greatest family that I've ever known. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=177.12s)]
*  All right, John. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  John, we all want to have a Jack and Coke with you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=182.24s)]
*  You seem like such a fun guy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  Next time you're in New York, come on over. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iv7jrti9MQ&t=188.16000000000003s)]
