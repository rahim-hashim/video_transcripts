# Attorney warns Americans: This is 'something everyone should be concerned about'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM)
*  All right, in battle, New York Mayor Eric Adams pleading not guilty to federal corruption [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=0.0s)]
*  charges yesterday in a Manhattan court. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=4.8s)]
*  His attorney doubling down on his client's innocence and distancing the mayor from an [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=7.12s)]
*  advisor whose phone was seized by the feds. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=11.38s)]
*  The entire body of evidence is one staffer. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=15.32s)]
*  One staffer that says there was a conversation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=18.76s)]
*  What you have not learned is that that staffer has lied. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=22.6s)]
*  When that staffer was first interviewed, that staffer said that Mayor Adams knew nothing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=26.68s)]
*  about this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  He was not involved in this and that he is innocent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=32.56s)]
*  They have that information. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  So here to react is New York criminal defense attorney and constitutional expert Ken Belkin. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Ken, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=42.8s)]
*  So let's go over the charges first. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=45.4s)]
*  They read as follows. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  One count conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery and to receive campaign [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=48.68s)]
*  contributions by foreign nationals. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=53.96s)]
*  Another count of wire fraud, two counts of solicitation of contribution by a foreign national. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=56.56s)]
*  There are allegations he was an unregistered foreign agent. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  This ties back to the Turkish government. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=67.62s)]
*  So we have two things going on I think we need to hold in our head. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  Serious allegations, influence on a politician by a foreign government, but yet not that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  salacious in terms of the details of what he is alleged to have received. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  Flight upgrades, discounted hotels. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=83.36s)]
*  Yeah, we've got allegedly a scheme that dates back to 2016 where the mayor, then Brooklyn [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=85.92s)]
*  borough president, received about 11 upgrades to business class on flights to Turkey and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=92.44s)]
*  other parts of the world, China and Paris, and he received a discount stay at the St. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=98.08s)]
*  Regis in Istanbul. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=103.4s)]
*  And what did he get for this 10 year scheme for upgrades? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Well the Turkish government may have gotten their consulate's fire inspection expedited. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=108.56s)]
*  It seems a little shaky that a 10 year scheme would result in a fire inspection expedition. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=114.96s)]
*  And yet it's obviously, first of all, do you think that this indictment, and we know only [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  so much, we know that there are some staffers involved as we mentioned yesterday, a phone [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=127.32s)]
*  seized from one of his staffers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=131.4s)]
*  He sounds, his response sounds a little bit like Donald Trump's response in some of these [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=134.4s)]
*  DOJ investigations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=139.4s)]
*  He feels like he has been targeted by a weaponized DOJ, and I think the implication is because [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=141.0s)]
*  of the stance he's taken on illegal immigration. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=145.56s)]
*  Well look, let's be clear, he's the mayor of one of the largest cities, if not the largest [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=147.68s)]
*  in America, and he is the only prominent Democrat who has voiced criticism of the Biden-Harris [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=151.64s)]
*  administration's failed immigration policy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=157.64s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=160.16s)]
*  And look, you've got Donald Trump on camera a year ago saying, hey look, this guy's critical, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=161.16s)]
*  he may end up indicted. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=165.96s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump's not a psychic as far as I know, but there is something going on, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  and people have raised the specter that maybe our prosecutors are being weaponized for political [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  purposes, and it's certainly something every American should be concerned about. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=177.0s)]
*  I think that's something we have to throw into our consideration. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  And we also have to consider, as we've talked about you and I here, that it doesn't feel [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  like a huge bribery scream at this point in terms of what he received and what was perhaps [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  returned to the Turkish government. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, American politicians under the influence of foreign governments, a massive [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=195.66s)]
*  issue. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=200.82s)]
*  Massive issue, we don't want it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=202.42s)]
*  And there is a second aspect to this indictment that he solicited foreign campaign contributions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=203.92s)]
*  But remember, all the evidence hinges on one Adam Staffer. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  One Adam Staffer who is not named in this indictment, he's referred to as Adam Staffer [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=213.1s)]
*  number one, I believe. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=217.5s)]
*  He's not named in the indictment, he's not named as a co-defendant, which means this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=219.34s)]
*  guy is cooperating witness with the government. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=223.4s)]
*  And he may have an axe to grind with his former boss, he may have his own criminal exposure, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  because he admitted to them that he was involved in a straw campaign donor scheme. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  Whether or not the mayor actually knew about it remains to be seen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=235.24s)]
*  Well, we'll see if this thing holds weight, if the charges are as valid as insinuated. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  But the issue of American politicians under the influence of foreign governments is something [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=244.94000000000003s)]
*  I think that we should be giving a lot more attention to. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  And let's hope that Mayor Adams isn't just a weaponized victim of this, but maybe the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  start of looking at how many politicians are under the influence of foreign governments. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=255.4s)]
*  But appreciate your shining light on this specific case as we need to start following this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ken. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Rob. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FXNE5qxIM&t=264.28000000000003s)]
