# Karoline Leavitt: The world knows Donald Trump is back
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s)
*  In just a few hours, President-elect Donald Trump said to ring the opening bell at the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=0.0s)]
*  New York Stock Exchange. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=3.6s)]
*  This comes as the latest Fox News poll of the year, and the last one, shows just how [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=5.18s)]
*  much the economy matters to Americans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=10.32s)]
*  60% say the economy is extremely important for him, Donald Trump, to focus on when he [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=12.56s)]
*  becomes president and he lowers prices. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  So the latest polling also shows a majority believe the border will be more secure with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=21.84s)]
*  the Trump administration in charge. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=26.68s)]
*  All in all, most voters say his victory leaves them feeling hopeful about what lies ahead [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=29.14s)]
*  under the Trump agenda. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=33.9s)]
*  Incoming White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, joins us now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=35.5s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=39.74s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=40.74s)]
*  Who is optimist? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=41.74s)]
*  I don't think you've been on the Kirby couch with us since it was named. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=42.74s)]
*  I think this is the first time, yes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=44.82s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=46.38s)]
*  How are you preparing for it? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=47.38s)]
*  Reading and researching and utilizing the brilliant minds we have coming into this cabinet, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=48.38s)]
*  sitting down with Scott Besson this week, Senator Kelly Loeffler to talk about SBA just [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=53.46s)]
*  being a sponge for their wisdom to understand all of the issues. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=58.02s)]
*  We have a lot of problems as a country, and President Trump is going to take strong action [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  to fix these problems. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=66.66s)]
*  And you have Taylor and you have Dana here that you can always find out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=67.66s)]
*  I do, and they've given me phenomenal advice. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=68.66s)]
*  I'm sure you don't need advice from us, but I remember with Tony Snow, before we went [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=70.66s)]
*  to the White House, I got this radio show, and I remember he said to me, I go, what was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  your prerequisite? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=80.38s)]
*  Why did you decide to do it? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=81.38s)]
*  He said because the president told me, George W. Bush, I could be in the meetings because [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=82.7s)]
*  I didn't want it relayed to me what was happening. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=88.14s)]
*  I had to be there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=90.42s)]
*  Do you have that type of guarantee? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=93.98s)]
*  I have a direct relationship with President Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=95.3s)]
*  I can call him. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=97.86s)]
*  He will answer. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=98.86s)]
*  I've been working for him now for a couple of years, so he's a great boss to work for. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=99.86s)]
*  And when you ask him a question, he tells you the truth. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=104.62s)]
*  This is going to be such a change of pace from the last four years because when the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=107.06s)]
*  people in the briefing room ask actual questions, they get something read out of a binder, and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=110.36s)]
*  it is not sometimes accurate, and sometimes it's just flat out lie. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=116.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=121.72s)]
*  There's certainly been a lack of transparency over the past four years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=122.72s)]
*  If you talk to reporters off the record, they will tell you they are excited that President [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=125.28s)]
*  Trump will be back in the Oval Office because they know how much access they had to him [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=129.38s)]
*  and his press secretaries in his first term. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=132.92s)]
*  Well, it's not just the press that are excited now that they get that access. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=134.96s)]
*  Now you're going to have a president on record, going to have you having some exchanges back [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=138.6s)]
*  and forth with them, but the country is united right now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=141.98s)]
*  Everybody sees the joy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=145.06s)]
*  You're seeing people in Manhattan with MAGA hats. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=146.62s)]
*  You've got business CEOs that want to have a meeting with the president. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=149.12s)]
*  They're going to Mar-a-Lago, once criticize them, but saying, we want to work with him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=152.44s)]
*  Is the president surprised by that right now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  I think President Trump understands how the game is played right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  He's been in this world of politics now for many years, but it is great to see the unification [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=163.88s)]
*  that's happening across this country, not just with folks on Main Street, but also on Wall Street. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=168.6s)]
*  We're going to the New York Stock Exchange today and also the American people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=173.72s)]
*  I feel there's a real palpable spirit out there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=177.28s)]
*  People feel more optimistic because they know we're going to have a real leader again who's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=179.6s)]
*  going to make this country safe and strong and wealthy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=183.36s)]
*  So today Tom Homan's got an invitation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=186.16s)]
*  He's going to follow through with Mayor Adams. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=188.16s)]
*  I want to talk to you about how you want to do that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=190.32s)]
*  We have a sanctuary city. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=192.4s)]
*  Adams is really hostage to the city council. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=193.76s)]
*  Do you have a chance to talk to Tom Homan going in and what do you hope comes out of it? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=196.92s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=201.32s)]
*  I haven't spoken to Tom Homan about his meeting with Mayor Adams today. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=202.32s)]
*  I do know Tom Homan is the best and the brightest when it comes to the border, along with Stephen [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=205.2s)]
*  Miller, who will be our chief of staff over policy in the White House, and Governor Kristi [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=209.32s)]
*  Noem, who will be leading DHS. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=214.2s)]
*  Together, they make a very strong team who will be wholly focused on how we can secure [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=215.88s)]
*  the border and most of all, empowering our local and federal law enforcement to work [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=220.83999999999997s)]
*  together in these sanctuary cities, which will be no more when President Trump is back [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=226.4s)]
*  in the White House and they will find ways legally to shut down the border on day one [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  and to launch this mass deportation effort, which the majority of the American people [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=237.16s)]
*  support. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=241.36s)]
*  That's why they elected Donald Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=242.36s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=243.36s)]
*  In fact, there are tens of thousands of people who are in the country illegally and they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=244.36s)]
*  should be deported to their home country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  The home country is China and China won't take them back. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=250.44s)]
*  Maybe that's one of the things the incoming president can talk to Xi Jinping about because [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=253.52s)]
*  reportedly, and you could confirm this, it sounds like Donald Trump has invited President [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=258.92s)]
*  Xi to the inauguration. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=264.32s)]
*  So what can you tell us about that? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  That is true, yes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  And this is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  countries that are not just our allies, but our adversaries and our competitors too. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=275.12s)]
*  We saw this in his first term. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=279.14s)]
*  He got a lot of criticism for it, but it led to peace around this world. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=280.48s)]
*  He is willing to talk to anyone and he will always put America's interests first. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=283.76s)]
*  Has he RSVP'd? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=287.76s)]
*  To be determined. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=290.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=291.04s)]
*  Have other leaders been invited? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=292.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=293.04s)]
*  Typically, the inaugural committee extends invitations to the foreign dignitaries of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=294.04s)]
*  other countries. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=298.3s)]
*  That's precedent. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=299.3s)]
*  Our inaugural committee is doing that as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=300.3s)]
*  And so we'll see who shows up. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you know of, do you know in particular with the president and this crowd, last time [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  this big controversy about the crowd size, does the president care if his crowd is bigger [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=310.08s)]
*  than last time, bigger than Barack Obama, bigger than Joe Biden? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=314.56s)]
*  Well everything we're hearing is going to be a very large crowd. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  I won't estimate the size. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=321.0s)]
*  We will see on January 20th. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=322.32s)]
*  But what I will say on the foreign leader point as well, foreign leaders are lining [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=324.44s)]
*  up to talk to Donald Trump right now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=327.34s)]
*  He put out a truth about tariffs and Justin Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago in about 15 minutes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=329.12s)]
*  He had a great call with the president of Mexico and it's not just Mexico and Canada. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=334.12s)]
*  All of these world leaders understand. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=339.08s)]
*  You saw it in Paris last weekend. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=340.52s)]
*  He got the full presidential celebration everywhere he went. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  He had great meetings with the Prince of Wales and he also talked to the prime minister of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Italy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=350.8s)]
*  So the world knows Donald Trump is back in America, will be back as well. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5FZzV1q6s&t=351.8s)]
