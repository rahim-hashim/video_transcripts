# 'DEAD WRONG': Democrat ripped for criticism of his own party
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0)
*  So, Democratic former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling out his party as he appears to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=0.0s)]
*  considering a 2028 presidential run. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=6.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal saying, quote, he calls the party brand toxic and weak and woke. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Not to culture war issues he thinks Democrats have become too often fixated on that President [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=14.48s)]
*  Trump has successfully used against him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=20.22s)]
*  Democratic California Congressman Ro Khanna joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=23.84s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=27.28s)]
*  One thing I always appreciate about you is you're willing to talk to the other side. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=30.52s)]
*  But is Rahm Emanuel right here? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Has your party become too woke, too non masculine and not talking with people about the things [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=38.32s)]
*  that matter? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=44.44s)]
*  Now he's dead wrong. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=45.44s)]
*  Look, this is the party of FDR. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=48.44s)]
*  We did originally make in America. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=50.96s)]
*  We industrialized the entire country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=52.92s)]
*  It's the party that has guaranteed Americans Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=55.2s)]
*  I'm calling for a new economic patriotism so we become a manufacturing superpower so [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  we have high paying jobs and build wealth in every community and have a Marshall Plan [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  for America. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  The history of the Democratic Party, it's a great party. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=70.72s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem is, Congressman, before you can get on this, and some voters may like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=73.44s)]
*  that, but they don't hear any of that because they feel lectured by the party. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  All these pronouns, no one cares about that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=84.28s)]
*  Well, look, I'm totally opposed to canceling people for saying the wrong word or telling [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=87.28s)]
*  a joke. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=96.56s)]
*  I've been one of the biggest defenders of free speech. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=97.56s)]
*  But when you go to places like Lorraine, Ohio or Johnstown, Pennsylvania, what they're telling [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  you about is how are we going to get good paying jobs? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  How are we going to get a new factory? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=107.52s)]
*  How are we going to get our kids new economic opportunity? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=109.3s)]
*  The Democrats have a plan. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=112.52s)]
*  What it will take is investment there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=114.2s)]
*  What it is going to take is helping finance new factories, buying things from people who [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=115.96s)]
*  make things in America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  There's a group in the House, they're called Economic Patriots. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=122.44s)]
*  It's with Chris D'Aluzio in Western Pennsylvania. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  That's what most Democrats are talking about. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=128.6s)]
*  And I believe that a new economic patriotism can win back people across this country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=131.2s)]
*  Yeah, but Congressman, no one's listening to that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=135.72s)]
*  You guys in the Democrat House have the lowest approval rating ever. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=137.72s)]
*  I hear these plans and proposals. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  You guys are always great about that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=145.48s)]
*  Releasing documents, doing analysis and all that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=147.48s)]
*  But no one's listening to you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=150.28s)]
*  Well, look, we may not be making headway in the mainstream belt way, but what I believe [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=152.8s)]
*  is we got to get out into the community. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=159.4s)]
*  I spend more of my time in places like Johnstown, Milwaukee, places that have been deindustrialized. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=161.24s)]
*  And here's the reality. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=167.68s)]
*  Just having blanket tariffs aren't going to bring back the factories. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=169.68s)]
*  We know what will. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=172.84s)]
*  We got to make investments there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=173.96s)]
*  We've got to invest in the workforce. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=175.88s)]
*  We've got to create apprenticeships. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=176.88s)]
*  We've got to help people who don't have a college degree. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  And we can deliver. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=181.84s)]
*  We did with the semiconductor industry. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=182.84s)]
*  OK, so one of the ways that you guys also have to move forward is dealing with the past [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=184.76s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=189.32s)]
*  And a lot of people are calling it a cover-up. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=190.32s)]
*  This is what Jake Tapper had to say about what took place with Joe Biden and the people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=192.72s)]
*  that knew about it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=198.48s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=199.48s)]
*  It is an entirely separate scandal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=200.48s)]
*  It is a scandal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=203.16s)]
*  It is without question and maybe even worse than Watergate in some ways. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=204.92s)]
*  Because Richard Nixon was in control of his faculties when he wasn't drinking. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=212.2s)]
*  So Congressman, it was cheap fakes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  You even said after her report on Fox that Joe Biden was completely mentally sharp. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=221.6s)]
*  Do you have any regrets? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=227.32s)]
*  Well, I do have regrets for backing him for a second term. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=229.76s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=234.92s)]
*  I've said that the Democrats should own up to that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=235.92s)]
*  We should have pushed back against a lot of what we were hearing from the White House. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=238.84s)]
*  I met him a few times. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=243.88s)]
*  In those instances, he was fine. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=245.72s)]
*  But the reality is he shouldn't have run. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=247.72s)]
*  I think the Democrats would be better just owning up and saying that was a mistake. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=249.84s)]
*  The American people are fair, but we do have to take accountability. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=254.08s)]
*  Yeah, but Congressman, I think it's more than a mistake. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=256.76s)]
*  A mistake is when I forget to put my right signal or my left signal on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=259.72s)]
*  The book outlines that it was intentional. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=264.36s)]
*  As long as he was breathing, the aides and members of Congress, the Democratic establishment [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=267.56s)]
*  just wanted to keep him alive so they could get the agenda. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=273.32s)]
*  So is this a massive cover up? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=276.5s)]
*  Well, certainly not that I know of. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=279.54s)]
*  I mean, I met him a few times in the year. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=282.7s)]
*  He was perfectly fine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=285.42s)]
*  But I do think what the mistake was, was that we should have pushed back more against the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=286.7s)]
*  old guard and insisted on new voices. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=290.44s)]
*  And now you're seeing that in the Democratic Party. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=292.9s)]
*  You're seeing a lot of new voices there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=294.9s)]
*  You're seeing a demand for the old guard to step aside. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=297.08s)]
*  And you're seeing a focus on the economy, a real vision of how we're going to raise [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=299.5s)]
*  wages, get new jobs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=304.38s)]
*  You know, I represent a district of 14 trillion dollars in Silicon Valley. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=305.98s)]
*  I want to see wealth generation in the modern economy across this country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=309.18s)]
*  And that's really the focus. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  So that's going to be a new generation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=314.70000000000005s)]
*  All right, Congressman, we appreciate you coming on this morning. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=320.5s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hokv8ifOkj0&t=321.5s)]
