# Lara Trump: This is really frightening
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI)
*  There's also been a lot of discussion recently about your mental and physical capabilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=0.0s)]
*  while you were in office. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=6.68s)]
*  You can see that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=8.16s)]
*  I'm mentally incompetent and I can't walk. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=9.16s)]
*  I could beat the hell out of both of them. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=10.16s)]
*  I'm very proud. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=11.16s)]
*  I put my record as president against any president at all. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=12.16s)]
*  Former President Biden cracking jokes about his mental fitness in his first public remarks [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=19.56s)]
*  since his cancer diagnosis. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=24.6s)]
*  But Republicans aren't laughing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=27.12s)]
*  Laura Trump was one of the few who called out his decline early on and she joins us [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=28.8s)]
*  now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  She's the host of My View on Saturday night. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  It's great to see you, Laura. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=37.32s)]
*  So it really is kind of amazing to look at that clip right there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=38.44s)]
*  As you know, for during the entire four years of his presidency, I have no idea what he's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=42.0s)]
*  saying and I didn't even get that he was joking until somebody explained it to me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, is that what that was? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=53.24s)]
*  Was that supposed to be a joke, Charlie? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=55.6s)]
*  I'm not sure either. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=56.84s)]
*  I think we're all still struggling to interpret what Joe Biden is saying. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=57.88s)]
*  But that's really the scary part of all of this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  And you know, you look at November 5th of 2024, that was a day that really determined [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=64.64s)]
*  a lot for the future of America. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=69.92s)]
*  Obviously, Kamala Harris at that point was the Democrats nominee. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=71.48s)]
*  But you think about the fact that had Donald Trump not won this election, guys, we would [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=75.56s)]
*  not even be talking about this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=80.76s)]
*  Jake Tapper wouldn't have a book out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=82.4s)]
*  The liberal media would not be actually talking about the fact that Joe Biden's decline was [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=84.54s)]
*  so severe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=88.48s)]
*  And I mean, it's really frightening. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=90.3s)]
*  I think we're looking at one of the greatest scandals in American political history, you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=91.66s)]
*  know, whether it's just sweeping under the rug what was going on with Joe Biden, the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=97.14s)]
*  lies that were told to the American people, the auto pen, as President Trump likes to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=100.42s)]
*  point out, that was used time and time again to sign very significant documents. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=104.5s)]
*  There's so much to unpack here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=110.1s)]
*  I think the great news is that you have Republicans in the House saying, look, we want to investigate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=111.58s)]
*  this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=116.66s)]
*  They actually are bringing a lot of Biden staffers in to question them, to say, what [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=117.66s)]
*  did you know? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=121.02s)]
*  When did you know what was going on? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=122.02s)]
*  Who is using the auto pen? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=123.42s)]
*  But yes, I think it is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  It's terrifying to think about Joe Biden having been president for the past four years, guys, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=126.86s)]
*  but imagine Donald Trump hadn't won. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=132.22s)]
*  We wouldn't even be talking about this right now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=133.9s)]
*  Now, Larry, you know something about Jake Tapper. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=136.14s)]
*  Let's play this clip and have you react to it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=139.26s)]
*  I think there are any number of people that were part of this decision to hide how bad [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=143.06s)]
*  it was, not only from the media, not only from the public, but also from cabinet officials, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=147.98s)]
*  from people in the White House, from Democratic lawmakers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=155.18s)]
*  I mean, there was a period, 2023, 2024, Democratic lawmakers barely saw the president. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=157.98s)]
*  And yes, I think it was Jill Biden. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=164.16s)]
*  I also think it's Hunter Biden. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=165.86s)]
*  I also think President Biden has some agency here, too. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=167.22s)]
*  We're not saying it was weekend at Bernie's. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=170.54s)]
*  He was aware what was going on. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=173.06s)]
*  I'm saying he wasn't. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=174.3s)]
*  He had moments where he was non-functioning, but he understood what was going on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=176.3s)]
*  I mean, we saw him earlier today. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=180.14s)]
*  He can speak and talk. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=182.3s)]
*  If you hear him right now, he could talk for 10, 15 minutes and be fine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=183.38s)]
*  Larry, during that time, Tapper attacked you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=186.26s)]
*  He thought you were making fun of his stutter. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=189.26s)]
*  Yeah, that whole situation was atrocious. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=192.14s)]
*  You know, just the accusation that I would ever make fun of someone with some sort of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=196.22s)]
*  a disability got a New York Times op-ed written by Captain Sully Sullenberger to say what [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=200.3s)]
*  a horrible person I was. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=206.26s)]
*  So I'm expecting, of course, Lucas, some sort of an apology from him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=207.54s)]
*  I'm sure that'll be coming soon as well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=210.94s)]
*  But it's very, it's pretty, it's pretty incredible to hear Jake Tapper now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=213.94s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of these folks on the other side of this trying to tell us that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=218.46s)]
*  we should now believe them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=223.18s)]
*  You know, Mr. Jake Tapper is one of the worst reporters and journalists in the history of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=224.82s)]
*  America because we could all see with our own eyes and hear with our own ears, Joe Biden [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=228.1s)]
*  was not cogent at all. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=232.3s)]
*  He was very disturbed whenever we saw him in public. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=234.7s)]
*  He had to have this group of people take him to Marine One. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=237.9s)]
*  He was specifically calling on reporters, not President Trump who you see in the Oval [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=241.14s)]
*  Office calling on everybody, as transparent as he possibly could be. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=245.06s)]
*  It's a little too late, I think, for a lot of these people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=249.6s)]
*  And the fact that Jake now even is like, yeah, for 10 to 15 minutes, he was fine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=251.9s)]
*  This is the leader of the free world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=255.78s)]
*  He needs to be fined 24 hours a day. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm the one to point that out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=259.66s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, you pointed out so much so early and you were attacked for it and you stuck [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=261.42s)]
*  to your guns. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=267.14s)]
*  And I love that about you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iKoWB4VOdI&t=268.14s)]
