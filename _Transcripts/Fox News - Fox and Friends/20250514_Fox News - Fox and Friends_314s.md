*  well [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=57.32s)]
*  You can see the all of these deals right and one of the things that I thought was really interesting about this visit [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=58.56s)]
*  It's who president Trump brought with him [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=64.12s)]
*  So there were at least eight publicly traded companies yesterday all of their stock except one more were up and some were up huge [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=66.08s)]
*  Right. So when you bring, you know Nvidia when you bring Jensen Wong over there with you when you bring some of these other folks [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=72.48s)]
*  Over there with you you want to that's the yeah the motor see the motorcade of the president going right now. I think he's heading [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=78.48s)]
*  To see the Royal Royal Court [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=86.12s)]
*  To get that greeting right now, but Charles this this is leg number two of this trip, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=89.48s)]
*  And and so think about in the last four days what we've seen over the weekend the big headlines Lawrence were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  The peace things right the India Pakistan troops and by the way, these are multi-decade conflicts [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Zelensky and Putin meeting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=110.04s)]
*  Even an even in in Turkey the Kurds giving up their insurgents and insurgency [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  Turkey saying they'll develop that area [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=118.4s)]
*  peace is breaking out where wars used to break out and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=120.48s)]
*  They're not gonna want to give him credit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=123.72s)]
*  But President Trump is overseeing all of this and you know, it's not a hard sell in Saudi Arabia [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=125.2s)]
*  United Arab Emirates, Dubai [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=131.36s)]

*  Were there someone there figured out we're gonna run out of oil one day [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=139.4s)]
*  What do we do then and and even in Saudi Arabia oil is no longer the number one moneymaker [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=142.22s)]
*  so it's the idea of a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  Peace as a foundation around the world is really the best [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=150.8s)]
*  Foundation for prosperity to spread around the world and we should spearhead that so you got that on the world stage [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=155.64000000000001s)]

*  half a percent [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  Blue-jean companies, how can retailers make money in this environment? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=194.24s)]
*  Your blue jeans are gonna double up apparel prices were down the things that were up are things we need, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=197.24s)]
*  We have to have motor vehicle maintenance has nothing to do with tariffs. We need motor vehicle insurance. We don't get it from China [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=202.48s)]
*  We need hospital services. We don't get it from China. We eat food from home [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=207.92s)]
*  We don't go all the way to Beijing for when we dine out [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Medical care the things that went up are things that we have to have and that has nothing to do with the tariffs all the things [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=214.0s)]
*  That went down and was most telling the thing that went down the most airfare is down almost 3% month over month [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=219.94s)]
*  What does that tell you we're tapped out as a nation, right? Because we had fun. We got the stem is we spent them [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=225.9s)]

*  If anything, it might be a one-time hit, you know, and and and that's historically what they've been a one-time adjustment [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=239.94s)]
*  But more importantly, they're not gonna pass these prices on if you're already struggling [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=246.38s)]
*  You're behind a credit card and something that you were gonna spend $400 on cost 450 bucks. You're not gonna buy it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=251.1s)]
*  You're simply not gonna buy it. That's why Wall Street went crazy because Wall Street doesn't care about Main Street [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=256.06s)]
*  They just care about corporate profits and even if they'd have to suffer for one or two quarters [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=261.38s)]
*  Oh my goodness, they can't feed at the trough for maybe three to six months. They lost their minds now [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=265.98s)]

*  Having to buy in and taking a loss. So they bet against America because of one thing TDS [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=282.58000000000004s)]
*  It was a huge mistake in my opinion never bet against America. No matter who's in the White House [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeCX7NiZTBo&t=287.74s)]
