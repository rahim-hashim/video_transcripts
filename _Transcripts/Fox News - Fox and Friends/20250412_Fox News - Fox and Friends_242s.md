# Bombshell report reveals Iran nuclear threat has risen to ‘extreme danger’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k)
*  holding high-level talks with Iran today, the first meeting since president withdrew [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=0.0s)]
*  from the Iran nuclear deal during his first term. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=4.92s)]
*  Those talks coming just in time as a shocking new report from the Institute for Science [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=8.38s)]
*  and International Security warns the current threat from Iran has risen to extreme danger. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=12.94s)]
*  Here to react, foreign policy expert Rebecca Heinrichs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=20.46s)]
*  Great to see you this morning, Rebecca. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=24.18s)]
*  So what is the incentive that Iran has right now to negotiate? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=25.42s)]
*  Well, they're in a very weak position, and so I'm sure they don't want to negotiate [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=31.82s)]
*  because they're not going to have a very strong hand to play. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=38.74s)]
*  But after that last Israeli counterattack against the Iranians in response to the Iran [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=42.22s)]
*  attack against Israel, the Israelis took out all of Iran's air defenses. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=48.06s)]
*  So Iran is sitting pretty vulnerable. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=52.660000000000004s)]
*  The Trump administration has cranked up the pressure campaign to dry up its resources, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=54.52s)]
*  and the United States has these B-2 stealth bombers, six of them, in the region pointed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  at Iran. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=64.4s)]
*  So if Iran doesn't want to have its nuclear program destroyed by the Israelis and the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=65.4s)]
*  United States, it better start talking. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=70.48s)]
*  So when you mentioned destroying their nuclear capabilities, what does that look like? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=73.04s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration has made clear that if this were to happen, the Israelis [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=81.12s)]
*  would certainly take the lead. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=85.52s)]
*  But the Israelis are going to need some support, military support from the United States. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=87.28s)]
*  Those B-2 bombers carry ordinances that are able to destroy deeply buried, hardened targets [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=91.4s)]
*  inside Iran. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=96.68s)]
*  That's where the nuclear facilities are. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  That's where all the infrastructure is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=99.48s)]
*  And so the B-2 bombers may play a role in destroying some of these deeply buried, hardened [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=101.36s)]
*  targets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=106.04s)]
*  And remember, the reason the Trump administration withdrew from the Obama-Iran deal is because [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=107.2s)]
*  that Iran deal left all of that infrastructure in place. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  It didn't require the Iranians to dismantle its program. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  And so as soon as those sanctions were relieved on the Iranians, they just went right back [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  to developing the program and enriching. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=122.12s)]
*  They are days away from having a nuclear warhead. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  And so there's an enormous amount of pressure on the Iranians right now to start talking. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise it's going to be destroyed by force, I think. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=131.36s)]
*  So realistically, what do we think Iran's response would be to a military strike? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=133.84s)]
*  Well, again, they're a much weaker capability militarily than what we even previously thought [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=140.12s)]
*  a couple of years ago. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=147.74s)]
*  So they don't have that many options. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=148.74s)]
*  Even as they support the Houthis and all other proxies around the region, they have not been [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=151.6s)]
*  able to harm American firepower in the region. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=156.48s)]
*  So they are really on their back heel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=159.4s)]
*  That's why I think that this is really a unique moment of opportunity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  And should the Trump administration with the Israelis take out this program, a much weaker [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=165.0s)]
*  power than, say, Russia or China, it still sends a message to those other powers that, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  listen, we're not going to talk all day. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=173.56s)]
*  We mean business. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=175.12s)]
*  We want to negotiate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=176.12s)]
*  You better start talking. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=177.12s)]
*  So as if that were not enough to keep the Trump administration busy, Steve Witkoff has [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=178.12s)]
*  just met with Putin for, I think, the third or fourth time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=183.12s)]
*  How do those negotiations look there in terms of ending the war in Ukraine? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=187.1s)]
*  Well, we don't have a whole lot of news to report on that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=192.26s)]
*  They did have a meeting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=197.58s)]
*  There was a flurry of news reports saying that the U.S. side was willing to make concessions [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=198.86s)]
*  that would weaken Ukrainian security. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=203.66s)]
*  Immediately the Trump administration dispelled that myth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=206.38s)]
*  And so we're kind of back at zero. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=209.9s)]
*  The Russians are the ones that are continuing their assault against the Ukrainians. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=211.34s)]
*  The Ukrainians have agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=214.82s)]
*  And so President Trump has already expressed his frustration, saying he's running out of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=217.34s)]
*  patience. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  He wants the Russians to negotiate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  The Russians can't just continue to delay and stall while they get a better military [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  advantage. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  Rebecca Heinrichs, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZujzWY9bn6k&t=230.01999999999998s)]
