# 14-year-old among suspects arrested in fatal NJ police shooting
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert out of New Jersey. One police officer is dead and another is fighting for his life after a shootout in Newark. According to reports, multiple suspects are in custody. Joining us now to discuss is Joseph and Faratrice, the founder of Blue Lives Matter NYC. Joseph, I'm glad you're with us this morning. Take us into the latest of what you know and what you're seeing here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, my heart goes out to the Newark Police Department. That's first off. These officers were there for some form of an investigation. A young individual did encounter them and open fire. The officer that was struck and run being told was killed was very well respected. A go getter went out every day dedicating his life to the city of Newark. The alleged gun that was recovered. I was with individuals last night that saw it. It looks like it could possibly be a ghost gun, but we have to understand in a situation like this, the investigation is ongoing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=25.76s)]
*  And the officers want to be able to do this job right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=54.72s)]
*  You know, it's just one of these very sober reminders of what every police officer across the country takes upon him or herself every single day that they go out on the front line. You look at what happened here, you lament it, but then you think about, okay, are we putting police officers in a position where they can do their job with confidence? How do you feel about that right now, Joseph? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=57.36s)]
*  We're putting police officers across this nation at a disadvantage. All right. Our legislatures all over this country have done nothing but put roadblocks in the way of our cops. I just came back from opening a week ago for bail reform. They have to wake up and start being proactive in regards to helping our police officers. They have to create deterrence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  Number one goal is to protect the public, but without protecting our cops and putting them in harm's way and having officers like this individual with a life ahead of him that's dead, that's not going to be able to have life experiences. Something's got to change. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=96.8s)]
*  And going back to President Trump's speech, we wholeheartedly need to have that deterrent of having the death penalty for anybody that intentionally goes out and kills a police officer. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=108.8s)]
*  You know, it just strikes me, we're learning a lot of details here, but a shootout fast food restaurant, is there anything about the circumstance to you that tells you that we just haven't made the progress we need to make in terms of how, you know, potential criminals are thinking about law enforcement and their ability to get away with things, the brazenness of what they do, Joseph? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=117.8s)]
*  Let's go a step further. The rumor is that 14 year olds were responsible for this. What 14 year old in their right mind is thinking about having an illegal firearm, let alone shooting at a police officer. Right there is something is wrong. And obviously the laws and the rules on the books are not enough for someone to say, wow, I should not do this because I will throw my life away. If they think they can get away with killing a police officer, what do you think that individual's going to do to the average citizen? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=140.8s)]
*  That's what strikes me as well. The tone is changing, I think, Joseph, at the top in D.C. with President Trump and it's filtering out, but there's so much more work to do here. Joseph, we appreciate your perspective on a very tough situation today. Thank you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCisZ681qzU&t=166.8s)]
