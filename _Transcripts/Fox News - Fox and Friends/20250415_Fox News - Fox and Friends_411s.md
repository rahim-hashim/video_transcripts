# BREAKING: Harvard defies Trump admin, faces $2 BILLION funding freeze
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM)
*  So let's talk about Ivy League colleges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=0.0s)]
*  And we know that the anti-Semitism [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=2.2s)]
*  raging on some of the most elite institutions in our country [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=4.0s)]
*  has to be addressed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=6.92s)]
*  And as soon as Barnard got raided a couple of months ago [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  by anti-Semitic activists from Colombia, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=12.76s)]
*  they knew the president this was his first opportunity [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=17.2s)]
*  to address it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=19.84s)]
*  So he took $400 million from them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=20.8s)]
*  And he said, do these five things or eight things [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  if you want to get it back. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=25.44s)]
*  And they're still in discussions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=26.68s)]
*  When it came to Harvard and the threats against Harvard [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=28.24s)]
*  to straighten out their curriculum, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  to straighten out the anti-Semitism on their campuses, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=32.4s)]
*  to start complying with some regulations [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=35.36s)]
*  that the administration put out, Harvard pushed back. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=39.84s)]
*  And they said, we will not. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=42.68s)]
*  And the president answered back legally last night [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=44.44s)]
*  by saying, if you will not, we're taking $2.5 billion [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=47.0s)]
*  from your grant system. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=50.84s)]
*  So there's this task force that is trying to get that money. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=53.32s)]
*  Harvard, essentially, they've come back. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=57.0s)]
*  And they've said, you know what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=59.84s)]
*  What the administration is asking us to do [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  is unconstitutional. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=64.0s)]
*  It also flies in the face of our First Amendment rights. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=65.24s)]
*  The president of Harvard, a fellow [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=68.0s)]
*  by the name of Alan Garber, sent a letter to the community [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=70.36s)]
*  to explain it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=73.28s)]
*  He said, although some of the demands outlined [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=73.84s)]
*  by the government are aimed at combating anti-Semitism, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=75.72s)]
*  majority represent direct governmental regulation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=78.52s)]
*  of the intellectual conditions at Harvard. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=82.92s)]
*  We have informed the administration [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  through our legal counsel that we will not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=86.46s)]
*  accept their proposed agreement. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  The university will not negotiate [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=89.78s)]
*  over its independence or its constitutional rights. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=92.1s)]
*  So they've been hit with this $2.2 billion federal freeze. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=98.78s)]
*  I would imagine this is a battle that Harvard's going to fight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=101.1s)]
*  Because while that's $2 billion, they've [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=104.66s)]
*  got an endowment at Harvard of $53 billion. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=107.78s)]
*  So they've got a pile of dough they could rely on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=113.58s)]
*  if they're going to fight this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  So the president's freezing $2.2 billion on grants, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=119.62s)]
*  $60 million in contracts. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=122.34s)]
*  President Obama applauded this because it's his alma mater. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=124.38s)]
*  But Elise Stefanik also graduated from Harvard. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=127.1s)]
*  And she was on Sean's show last night sounding off about it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=129.74s)]
*  But here's my question, Lawrence. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=132.3s)]
*  Why should police officers, why should teachers, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=133.86s)]
*  why should bricklayers and our blue collar workers [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=136.94s)]
*  and the people in Detroit making our cars, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=140.06s)]
*  why should they have to pay for schools that will continue [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=142.54s)]
*  and allow anti-Semitism on their campus? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=146.26s)]
*  Because that's what happens. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=148.82s)]
*  These are tax dollars. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=149.94s)]
*  Harvard does have this huge endowment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=151.18s)]
*  And let all of that money go to community colleges. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  Let it go to Mike Rowe, who's starting trade schools. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  Allow that money to go toward individuals [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=160.42s)]
*  who are working hard in America and never [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=163.94s)]
*  would have gotten into Harvard or can't afford Harvard. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=165.78s)]
*  You're exactly right, Ainsley. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=170.18s)]
*  They are not only anti-Semitic, but they [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=173.5s)]
*  allow people in on these visas that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=176.3s)]
*  essentially hate the country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=179.66s)]
*  They want to redo what America is. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=181.1s)]
*  And they have been very vocal about the people that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=184.3s)]
*  have been deported by the president as a result of them [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  violating their visa. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=193.74s)]
*  The second thing is they don't want cops on their campus [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=196.12s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=199.18s)]
*  A lot of these campuses shun law enforcement, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=200.02s)]
*  don't want them there, and feel like they're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  an enemy to the American people, which we know is untrue. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=205.18s)]
*  Let's talk with some of the diners right now [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=209.02s)]
*  and see what they're saying. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=211.38s)]
*  One of the lawyers fighting for Harvard [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=212.9s)]
*  is Robert Herr, famously did the Herr report on Biden. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  And the other one's a conservative too, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=218.86s)]
*  so they think they have an advantage there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=220.46s)]
*  I would say this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  They're going to have to evaluate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=223.46s)]
*  They're going to have everything under scrutiny. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  Why are they taking so many international students? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=227.18s)]
*  What countries are contributing to their institution? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=229.3s)]
*  What is in their curriculum? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  They have to expose it all because the administration is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=233.5s)]
*  just amping it up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=236.02s)]
*  Princeton's also fighting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=237.34s)]
*  Columbia's capitulating as of now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  Maybe when they get a permanent president, they might change. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=241.5s)]
*  But go ahead, Lawrence. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=243.94s)]
*  Yeah, you're exactly right though, Brian. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=247.18s)]
*  Let's go find some folks to talk to. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  Hey, how you doing, sir? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=252.06s)]
*  I'm doing great, man. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=253.02s)]
*  So Harvard, they're not going to comply with the administration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=253.94s)]
*  They said, get rid of the anti-Semitism, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=257.74s)]
*  the people that hate our country, that want visas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=260.18s)]
*  We're going to start revoking those visas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=263.54s)]
*  Harvard, as a result, have said, well, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=266.02s)]
*  we don't want the money then. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=268.02s)]
*  We're not going to negotiate with the administration. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=269.18s)]
*  Where do you stand on this? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=271.14s)]
*  I stand 100% behind Donald Trump's decision [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=272.38s)]
*  to not fund them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=275.3s)]
*  People that work against his country are totally wrong. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=276.98s)]
*  The woke need to wake up, OK, and get on the right side [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=279.82s)]
*  of what's going on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=283.18s)]
*  One minute they're saying one thing, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=284.06s)]
*  next minute they're saying the other thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=285.42s)]
*  They're doing a lot of flip-flopping, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=286.7s)]
*  and I'm totally against it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=288.38s)]
*  This is our country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=290.14s)]
*  We need to stand up for this country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=291.26s)]
*  I was a 9-11 first responder. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=292.94s)]
*  I love our cops. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=294.86s)]
*  I love our military. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=296.06s)]
*  And people need to do the right thing by us first, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=297.02s)]
*  and that's it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=299.38s)]
*  What about you? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=300.98s)]
*  A lot of people agree with you too, sir. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=301.78s)]
*  He's talking about 9-11, and you see these people protesting [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  in the middle street. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=306.78s)]
*  Some of them are not even American citizens. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=307.7s)]
*  They want to overthrow a lot of the government. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=310.58s)]
*  Some of them have been extremely anti-Semitic. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=314.86s)]
*  Is the president making the right move here? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  I love him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=320.5s)]
*  I think he's doing a great thing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=321.14s)]
*  I'm behind him 1,000%. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=323.3s)]

*  They've been talking about some of the issues that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=338.7s)]
*  matter to the country so much, and this is one of them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=340.82s)]
*  We've got to protect our country, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=344.58000000000004s)]

*  on these college campuses. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=347.74s)]

*  Where's Joe? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=355.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's Joe. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=356.22s)]
*  This is the guy in charge. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=357.38s)]
*  He said he grew up with you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=358.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=359.86s)]
*  But I think he's a Chaminade guy, though. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=361.54s)]
*  Phil Batee is the man. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=364.62s)]

*  Oh, good. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=369.94s)]
*  I prepared a dossier, and at some point, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=372.46s)]
*  I will release it on Fox and Friends. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=375.14s)]
*  And you remember Joe. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=376.9s)]
*  I'm not prepared to do it this morning. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=377.7s)]
*  Is it a dirty dossier? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=379.62s)]
*  Claire Massapiqua's ever had. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=381.34s)]

*  How much did you pay him? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=389.98s)]
*  But he also tried to get Teddy Roosevelt's statue [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=391.18s)]
*  when they tried to get rid of it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=394.06s)]
*  I remember. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=395.42s)]
*  He was going to bring it to Long Island. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj8cneOkLdM&t=395.9s)]
