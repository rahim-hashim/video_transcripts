# 'FOLLOW THE MONEY': Musk reveals biggest source of fraud found by DOGE
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo)
*  Elon Musk was on with Larry Kudlow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=0.0s)]
*  Very expansive interview where they talked a little bit about right now they've got a hundred employees at Doge. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=2.96s)]
*  Super geniuses as the president calls them. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=9.32s)]
*  He would like two hundred so essentially they would like to double it so they can look more effectively at government waste. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=11.48s)]
*  Here is Elon Musk talking about the biggest source of waste and it's going to drive you crazy. Watch. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=17.76s)]
*  Right. Well we just basically follow the money. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=24.92s)]
*  We look at the president's executive orders and we also just follow the money. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=28.28s)]
*  So we started looking closely at USCID because they were completely violating the president's executive orders to suspend foreign foreign aid. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=32.12s)]
*  You know what's what's called foreign aid. But in our view is a lot of corruption. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=42.56s)]
*  So what we saw there is just a tremendous amount of money being sent to non-governmental organizations. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  But actually it's a this by the way is I think one of the biggest sources of fraud in the world is government funded non-governmental organizations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  This is a gigantic fraud loophole where the government can give money to an NGO and then that there are no controls over that NGO. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=63.279999999999994s)]
*  So they've given billions dollars in debt. We estimate tens of billions of dollars to NGOs that are essentially scams. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=73.72s)]
*  When people when these migrants were coming over the border they were given to an NGO. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=80.36s)]
*  An NGO would take over and find shelter for them would feed them and would find travel would use that money to travel them or to ship them to different places around our country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=84.84s)]
*  It was a way for the federal government under Joe Biden to hide the real costs of the border crisis because guess what with NGOs federal dollars billions of dollars given to NGOs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=94.36s)]
*  They don't have no record keeping. So it's a way to say oh we gave the Catholic charities or whatever an NGO X amount of dollars. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  That's not part of the border money. Well part of it also is they would give the NGOs the money the Biden administration did so the United States government didn't have to build a mechanism to take care of all the migrants. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=112.76s)]
*  It's like OK we let them all in rather than balloon the budget even further. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=123.28s)]
*  We're going to give the money to these NGOs and they're going to figure it out so that any time there's a problem we'll just go look at the NGOs are the ones who are supposed to be in charge of that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=128.4s)]
*  The fact that they're given our money but it's the fact that we have homeless people all across this country we've got veterans on the street that don't have housing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=139.76s)]
*  We've got people in North Carolina that are still suffering got people in Los Angeles that have to rebuild their houses and the government is spilling all of these money to people that are non-citizens. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=146.92s)]
*  That doesn't even include all the foreign aid that they've been given money for all these dumb programs and we can't get any help. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=157.16s)]
*  But we have no problem shoving our money for hotels and food and then they throw the food in the trash because they don't like the menu. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=171.84s)]
*  But I would love to see being the real Elon Musk keep saying this NGOs telling the same thing that Joe Rogan told Larry Cutlow NGOs are the biggest scam he's seen in our government. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=172.96s)]
*  So let's attack it. Let's attack it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=182.72s)]
*  Maybe there's some things they are doing that the government can't do. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=184.44s)]
*  But what happens is with the Stacey Abrams situation she gets what two billion dollars to form an organization she has no experience in to get green these green appliances out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=187.48s)]
*  Two billion dollars and then they teach a course after how to spend two billion dollars to her new staff that has no experience with appliances. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=196.76s)]
*  So then why does that group get two billion dollars. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=204.32s)]
*  Where is the where is the tax statement on that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  So let's have the follow through and maybe we can collapse a whole you know a whole industry that's that's existing inside our government outside oversight. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=210.44s)]
*  It's time to get rid of these green appliances anyway. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=220.68s)]
*  I'm tired of running the washing machine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=222.96s)]
*  Just three times. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=224.44s)]
*  What are our priorities as a country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=225.36s)]
*  This next story there's a study that shows the cost of child care in 38 states plus D.C. now exceeds college tuition instead of buying green energy ovens when you already have an oven at your house. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=227.0s)]
*  Why not give that money to a family who can't afford child care. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=239.16s)]
*  Yes. So take a look at this right here in the District of Columbia the average for a four year old one family with one four year old is twenty eight thousand three hundred sixty five fifty six dollars for infant care for one year. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=243.0s)]
*  Whereas as you can see right there college tuition there in D.C. would be sixty two hundred Massachusetts. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=258.68s)]
*  These are gigantic numbers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=264.96s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why there is a problem in the United States where so many families who are just getting by are saying you know can afford it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=266.32s)]
*  I can't. I want to have a job but I can't. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  If I'm going to pay twenty eight thousand dollars per kid each year and I'm I'm just barely breaking even. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=278.0s)]
*  Maybe I stay at home with the kids. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  So I just find it fascinating if you want to talk one universal issue that goes past Republican or Democrat child care. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  Because people want to earn a living they got to figure out the balance and then they go with quality child care too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=295.12s)]
*  So I got to leave my kid but I got to feel good about it so I got to pay a little bit more than why am I working. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=300.08s)]
*  How am I saving. So that is something that I don't think you could ever you would ever be wasting your time to study. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=305.24s)]
*  So you can get that numbers down or make it more affordable or give credits in that direction. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSTzbDCVGo&t=312.36s)]
