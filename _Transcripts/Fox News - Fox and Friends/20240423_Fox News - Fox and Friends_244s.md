# 'Fox & Friends' reveals groups, funding behind anti-Israel protests
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0)
*  Let's break down where these protests are coming from, who is funding them, where they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=0.0s)]
*  started, and actually where the dollars are going. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=3.88s)]
*  All right, Will, let's begin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  First off, they're everywhere. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=8.6s)]
*  And they're everywhere, Brian, but they're often under one banner. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=10.1s)]
*  This is what to know behind these protests you're seeing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=14.0s)]
*  On-campus organizations, Students for Justice in Palestine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=17.28s)]
*  Brian, it's basically behind most of the major campus protests we've seen, and as I pointed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=20.6s)]
*  out, as I mentioned, it's everywhere. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  It's all across the country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=28.16s)]
*  Yeah, you've got 200-plus chapters of various sizes, smaller ones over in Tufts, smaller [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=29.2s)]
*  ones over in Emerson, but bigger in the Ivy League schools. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  How do they communicate? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=37.68s)]
*  You can guess it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=38.96s)]
*  They go through the cell phone, go through text messages, go through certain sites. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=39.96s)]
*  And these are some of the colleges that have gotten our attention. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=44.42s)]
*  Yeah, these are the notable chapters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=46.24s)]
*  These are the ones we're covering in the news right now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=47.24s)]
*  They're making the most noise. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  You know, Berkeley, NYU, Yale, Columbia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  But again, I think the important point is 200-plus chapters across the country for Students [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=53.04s)]
*  for Justice in Palestine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=58.16s)]
*  So they've been there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=59.8s)]
*  They've been simmering underneath, waiting since October 7th. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=60.8s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk about the pro-Israel because of the massacre they suffered. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=63.68s)]
*  But believe it or not, if you go on TikTok, there are more things Stand with Palestine [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=69.12s)]
*  from October 7th, even the following week, than there was Stand with Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=72.92s)]
*  So the big question is, well, who's behind Students for Justice in Palestine? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=77.1s)]
*  Well here are some of the groups funding that organization. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  This Westpac stands for Westchester Foundation, headed by an anti-Zionist ex-Orthodox Jew. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=84.48s)]
*  And you can see they sponsor, Brian, all these different elements of SJP, Students for Justice [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=93.44s)]
*  in Palestine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  And we've seen these groups out and about. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  We've seen them with signs and we've seen some of their chants in terms of what are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=100.44s)]
*  their resources when they go to jail? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  What are their resources when they get kicked off campus? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Like Congresswoman Omar's daughter. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=107.92s)]
*  This is where they can go. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=111.26s)]
*  These are where a lot of the funding is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=112.64s)]
*  Yeah, they go to A15 bail, legal defense fund. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  They're not only organizing putting it together, but what happens to you if you're arrested [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=118.28s)]
*  at the protest? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=121.76s)]
*  Yeah, this isn't, Mom, I got drunk last night, I'm in prison, I got a drunk driving ticket. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=122.76s)]
*  They know exactly where to go when they get themselves in trouble and they know exactly [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=126.4s)]
*  their rights when they get themselves on campus. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=129.66s)]
*  And this leads to this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Other funding, student governments, talking about how the protest fund is self-funded, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=133.26s)]
*  American Muslims for Palestine, a lot of this is opaque stuff. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=138.28s)]
*  When I was in college, they used to pick out stand-up comedians and when to appear [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=141.24s)]
*  and what venue to go. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=145.36s)]
*  There, they're doing protests. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=146.56s)]
*  Now, this might be the most important wall. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=148.0s)]
*  Well, this is off-campus stuff. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=149.72s)]
*  So Students for Justice for Palestine, that's on-campus student organizations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=151.0s)]
*  Then you got stuff that's happening off of campus, like American Muslims for Palestine, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=155.96s)]
*  the parent organization, informally, of SJP. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Right, and you see a lot of these lectures hop on campus. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=163.88s)]
*  They got to get paid. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  That's where the money comes from. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  You see a lot of their antics, like on Monday was El-Quds Day. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=168.64s)]
*  They stopped the Golden Gate Bridge. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  They maybe blocked traffic in your tunnel, in your area, to make what point? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=174.32s)]
*  That they're powerful, that they have something to say. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=179.2s)]
*  And El-Quds, not a positive organization. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, tell everybody, what is El-Quds a reference of? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=184.16s)]
*  They're the outgrowth of the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  The El-Quds force is the one that kills our people in Iraq and tries to bomb them out [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=191.16s)]
*  as early, as late as two days ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=197.12s)]
*  So named after El-Quds, the El-Quds committee is the one, for example, the protest you heard, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Death to America Chance, that's this group, who also has big plans come this summer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  The worst is yet to come for the DNC. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  In Chicago, plans are already in place to create chaos in the streets, inside or out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=211.0s)]
*  And they're not pro-Republican, they're just anti-democratic party, unless they change [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=217.1s)]
*  and become pro-Palestinian. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=221.74s)]
*  So that's the astroturf behind a lot of these protests that you see that look like students, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=223.52s)]
*  and it does attract students, but this is the funding, the organization behind these [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=228.16s)]
*  student protests across campus. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=231.52s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCl6MCPIw0&t=233.24s)]
