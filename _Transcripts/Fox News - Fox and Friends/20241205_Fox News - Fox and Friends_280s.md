*  There he is, green left right there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=8.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, his father is reportedly considering, get this, preemptive pardons [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=9.72s)]
*  before President-elect Trump takes the office for a bunch of different people [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=14.36s)]
*  who might be in trouble during Trump's presidency. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=18.52s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=19.84s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=20.36s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson's at the White House for the latest. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=21.12s)]
*  Hey, Lucas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=23.16s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Where do you go when you receive a presidential pardon? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=25.48s)]
*  Well, Arby's, of course. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  We just have this new video into Fox showing Hunter Biden, as you mentioned, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=29.56s)]
*  smiling after receiving that presidential pardon from his father, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=34.04s)]
*  which wasn't just for the tax and gun charge, but of course, the 11 year period. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=37.92s)]
*  He's off and there you can see smiling after leaving the Arby's in Santa Barbara. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  And as we mentioned yesterday, we talked about Hunter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  This is that one day after Hunter's former landlord said [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=52.28s)]
*  Hunter had stiffed him for 300000 in rent money [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=55.04s)]
*  after Hunter spent some time in that $4.25 million mansion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=58.12s)]
*  Now, yesterday, back to the pardon on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=61.96s)]
*  still arguably the most powerful Democrat on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=64.6s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi weighing in on that pardon with this terse statement, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=67.4s)]
*  quote, I support the president. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=71.52s)]
*  Now, Humter might not be the only one receiving a pardon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=74.52s)]
*  This might just be the beginning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=77.0s)]
*  Here's the headline in Politico reporting Biden White House is discussing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=78.76s)]
*  preemptive pardons for those in Trump's crosshairs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  And according to Politico, President Biden's top aides are reportedly weighing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=86.24s)]
*  the idea of issuing preemptive pardons to current and former government officials [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=94.44s)]
*  That includes former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Senator-elect Adam Schiff [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=97.6s)]
*  and Dr. Anthony Fauci. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=102.12s)]
*  Fauci has been accused by Republicans and watchdog groups of lying to Congress [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  about the origins of the COVID-19 virus and his use of private email [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=108.24s)]
*  account to do government business. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=112.56s)]
*  Now, President-elect Trump has said that he does not seek retribution. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=114.48s)]
*  In fact, he told our own Sean Hannity that back in June. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=118.44s)]
*  Now, the next time we'll see President Biden fresh off his trip from Angola [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=121.72s)]
*  will be tonight on the ellipse where he will be lighting the White House Christmas tree. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=125.28s)]
*  And I checked the Fox News weather app. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=129.88s)]
*  The temperature is supposed to be 34 degrees. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=131.52s)]
*  A little chilly here in the nation's capital, guys. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=133.52s)]
*  Indeed. And it does it all. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=135.84s)]
*  Lucas, your story of presidential stuff in the history of the president [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=137.24s)]
*  and giving out pardons and clemency and stuff like that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=141.92s)]
*  Has he ever issued any president ever issued a pardon or clemency [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  for crimes that have not been either committed or proven or even to people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=151.0s)]
*  who weren't charged, aside from Richard Nixon? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=156.48s)]
*  I appreciate the pop quiz, Steve. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=160.2s)]
*  Nowhere in presidential history has a preemptive pardon being issued. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=162.44s)]
*  And that's something that many lawmakers are talking about, how unprecedented [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=166.88s)]
*  it could be. Right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=170.8s)]
*  So you could say every one of my family has pardoned. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  That thanks for a committed crime. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=175.68s)]
*  So Adam Schiff goes, excuse me, I didn't do anything. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=177.72s)]
*  You know, so we think you did. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Fowler is like, what I do, I thought I was a hero. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  Excuse me. So why you why you give me a pardon? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=185.12s)]
*  So you can't do that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=188.96s)]
*  I mean, I thought that Joe Biden was back to normalcy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. When he became president, this is the way you do things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=193.52s)]
*  These are the right forms to use. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=196.0s)]
*  And it was Donald Trump was making things up. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  This guy is putting pardons out on press releases. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=199.8s)]
*  And now he's going up to lawmakers in Adam Schiff's case. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, Adam Schiff doesn't think he did any wrong unless he knows he did. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=206.44s)]
*  He goes, I don't really want a pardon. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=210.0s)]
*  Jack Smith thinks he's, you know, he thinks he's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=211.96s)]
*  some type he's Matlock. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=216.36s)]
*  He's going to hunt you down. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  He thinks he's a hero, you know. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=219.72000000000003s)]
*  So I don't think he's going to want a pardon. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  I just think it is Trump. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=223.12s)]
*  The arrangement syndrome on steroids right now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=225.08s)]
*  I mean, the country is coming together. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=228.0s)]
*  You see all those the the people in big tech finally talking about, look, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=230.2s)]
*  we can work with the president, even got some Democrats on Capitol Hill saying, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=235.28s)]
*  OK, we can work with the president on this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=238.6s)]
*  And then you have these figures who are supposed to be the leadership [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=240.4s)]
*  of the Democratic Party freaking out for no reason. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=243.84s)]
*  I mean, remember when they said Lock Hillary Clinton up and Trump said, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=246.04s)]
*  I'm not going to do that because I didn't think it was best for the country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=249.28s)]
*  And she launched the dossier and tried to and then they still try to get them, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=251.44s)]
*  go after them. And so I think the panic is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=254.84s)]
*  they think Trump is going to treat them like they treated him. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=257.76s)]
*  And he doesn't want to do that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  He wants to move on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=263.4s)]
*  They know what what politicians are capable of because they were doing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=264.28s)]
*  They were doing it. Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqJ__w0Zdwg&t=268.24s)]
