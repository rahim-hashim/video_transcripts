# Trump's rally in Butler 'was so much more': Former House speaker
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg)
*  A very big thank you to Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. And as I was saying. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Trump picking up right where he left off as he rallied thousands in Butler, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=18.56s)]
*  Pennsylvania yesterday, less than three months after the first assassination attempt on his [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=23.76s)]
*  life. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joins us now. Kevin, we were talking just a little [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=28.92s)]
*  bit as we were walking up here and you said this moment was more than political. What [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  do you mean? It wasn't really a political rally. It meant so much more. Honor the family, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=40.36s)]
*  Corey who lost his life and those who were shot. But to finish the job, nothing symbolizes [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=46.08s)]
*  more this man Donald Trump. He's more resilient than anyone I've ever met. It symbolizes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=50.92s)]
*  the nation. You couldn't leave this with this community that that was the last instance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=57.0s)]
*  When the President says as I was saying, what he's saying is I'm finishing this speech. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=62.8s)]
*  I'm going to finish my job. I got one more term. I'm going to do the very best for this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=67.64s)]
*  nation and I'll never give up on it. And to the crowd that was there. You know, I remember [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=71.5s)]
*  talking to the President the day after the shooting and he was telling me how he could [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=75.64s)]
*  hear the bullet, right? But what dawned on me when you watched the assassination attempt, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=78.92s)]
*  no one ran. Nobody ran. And the defiance when they stood up that they were going to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=85.24s)]
*  fight for the nation. I think it was more of a symbol for the entire nation to heal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=91.24s)]
*  I'm back. We're going to honor those who were shot and we're not going to give up on you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  You know, that's what was so remarkable. We had Pete, you know, on the ground that morning [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=100.52s)]
*  and so many of the people that he interviewed had been at the rally the last time. So it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  pilgrimage. It was, as you say, we're going to finish this rally the right way. And you're [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=111.32s)]
*  right, the crowd was part of the story. The fact that there wasn't a stampede, the fact [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  that they were as brave as the President and they were in that moment more concerned for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  the lives of each other and the President than their own. And then of course, as you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=126.88s)]
*  said, Corey, you know, throwing his body over his family's. I love that. I think there were [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=132.48s)]
*  some other gestures that we keep talking about it. You know, Ave Maria at a political [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=138.52s)]
*  rally. I still can't believe it. All my kids know that's, you know, if I die, that's going [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  to be at my funeral for sure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=147.72s)]
*  President Trump loves that song, too. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=148.72s)]
*  I know he loves that song, but that song speaks to Catholics, which is an important constituency. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=150.0s)]
*  Talk to me really quickly about Pennsylvania, because I want to get to leadership, but I [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=154.0s)]
*  do want you to talk about Pennsylvania. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=158.0s)]
*  I will tell you, it all comes down to three states. Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=159.0s)]
*  If the President Trump just carries what he carried last time, picks up Georgia and Pennsylvania, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  he's over the 270. He wins the presidency. And I will tell you, you really want to look [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=167.44s)]
*  at the environment in which you run. There was an interesting poll. Everybody takes a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  poll who you're voting for. But Gallup had one last week. Not who you vote for. Who do [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=175.16s)]
*  you identify with? And for the first time, more Americans identify with Republicans. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=179.48s)]
*  And secondly, they asked us another question. Who's best to solve the problems America has? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=184.56s)]
*  Republicans won there, too. So I think this could be a very good election, but a lot hinges [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=190.8s)]
*  on Pennsylvania. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=194.6s)]
*  You mentioned North Carolina, and there's a lot of mistakes being done by this administration [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=195.76s)]
*  in North Carolina. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=199.64s)]
*  But it's hurting lives. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=200.64s)]
*  It's hurting lives, and I think they're going to pay the price for that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=202.16s)]
*  You know, politics aside, when you're in leadership and a devastation happens, it really shows [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=205.16s)]
*  the character of who you are and your own leadership abilities to handle any other problem. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  What they have done during this time, and I've spoken to so many, to North Carolina [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  into South Carolina, and you find it into Georgia, it's devastating. They're still [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  looking for bodies today. And that's in America more than a week later. They don't have electricity. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  They don't have water. The challenge, you go through a family in the 21st century in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=229.12s)]
*  America? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=234.4s)]
*  Yeah. I think people across the country are outraged. Kevin McCarthy, thanks for coming [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=235.4s)]
*  in studio. We love having you here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VhreLGANg&t=241.48000000000002s)]
