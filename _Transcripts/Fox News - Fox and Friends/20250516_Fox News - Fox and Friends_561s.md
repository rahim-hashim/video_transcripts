# ‘PUNK MOVE’: Kid Rock blasts Springsteen’s anti-Trump rant
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI)
*  Kid Rock's Rockin' Rodeo returns tonight, kicking off the 2025 PBR World Finals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=0.0s)]
*  And you can catch it live on Fox Nation at 8 p.m. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=7.08s)]
*  The first, Steve, is live from my home state of Texas with a preview. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=9.76s)]
*  And he's joined by Kid Rock himself. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=13.92s)]
*  All right, there he is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=16.2s)]
*  Hello, Bobby. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=19.72s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=20.72s)]
*  Let's come right on over here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=21.72s)]
*  You got 13 million pounds of dirt here at AT&T Arena. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=23.32s)]
*  What's gonna happen tonight? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=29.16s)]
*  Oh, it's gonna be Rodeo reimagined with Teams Competition Rodeo, which we came up with and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=30.64s)]
*  invented myself in the PBR. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  So you got barrel racers racing head to head, calf ropers coming out of the chutes head [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=40.44s)]
*  to head, of course saddle bunk riding. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=44.16s)]
*  My part in this is the entertainment value, the shenanigans in between. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  The shenanigans. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=51.32s)]
*  The shenanigans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=52.32s)]
*  Of course, a big musical number. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=53.32s)]
*  We kick it off with a musical number. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  Most rodeos just do a musical thing at the end, a concert. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=56.31999999999999s)]
*  We kick it off with a huge grand opening. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  I have a very special guest. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=60.76s)]
*  Give me a hand. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  He's from Texas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=65.56s)]
*  Okay, that nerves it down to about 10,000. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=67.36s)]
*  Country artists. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=70.56s)]
*  And then we do a concert at the end. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=71.56s)]
*  But really, it's just about fun. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=74.52s)]
*  To me, this is one of the last pro-patriotic American sports really just left without the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=76.06s)]
*  interjection of all the wokeness, which I think is pretty much finding its exit pro [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=82.56s)]
*  sports. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=88.64s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=89.64s)]
*  Listen, there's so much of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=90.64s)]
*  This is got to be one of the biggest rooms you've ever been in here at AT&T Stadium. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=92.4s)]
*  They can seat a hundred thousand for a Cowboys game. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=101.16s)]
*  And what people don't realize is with this event being teams competition, that some of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=102.16s)]
*  the high seats are some of the best because it's like a football, you know, you can see [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  the whole thing developing underneath you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, what they'll do is sometimes, hey, Wendock, go ahead and ride around on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=113.94s)]
*  the horse a little bit. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=117.94s)]
*  So what they do is you start off like drag race. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=119.6s)]
*  Like there'll be a barrel racer down there and one down here, the barrels in the middle. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=121.94s)]
*  They'll come shooting out of the gates, ripping around the barrels, you know, they'll kind [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=125.22s)]
*  of meet in the center. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=129.42s)]
*  So there's some, you know, there's some possible high level of drama. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=130.42s)]
*  And the drama is there's a lot of money at stake. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=133.38s)]
*  A lot of money. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=135.38s)]
*  Last year was a million dollars. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=136.38s)]
*  I think it's that much this year. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=137.38s)]
*  I'd have to check, but it's a serious competition for them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=139.06s)]
*  But I like the shenanigans as much as I do the rodeo. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=141.94s)]
*  See, that's why you got to tune in to Fox Nation or show up in person. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=145.46s)]
*  They still have tickets available. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  You were actually just about 2000 feet away at the Rangers Stadium last night. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=151.26s)]
*  I believe you were with the former president, George W. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=156.66s)]
*  Bush, watching the game, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=160.7s)]
*  Yeah, W. It was great. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=162.06s)]
*  He invited me over with my special guest. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=163.34s)]
*  And we had to go eat and get some dinner. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=166.86s)]
*  So God, what a treat to be there and, you know, see him and his wife, Laura. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  He's so funny. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=173.66000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, no matter who it is, what you think of their politics, I respect the presidency. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=175.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=179.62s)]
*  And of course, I saw you with my biological son, Peter Doocy, in the Oval Office where [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=180.58s)]
*  Peter said that you looked like you were, I forget what you said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=187.74s)]
*  I was shot out of a cannon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  Like you were dressed like Ava Keneval. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=192.74s)]
*  I love it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=195.46s)]
*  Peter's so funny. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=196.3s)]
*  He's a funny guy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=197.34s)]
*  I heard another one, too, that I was dressed like a firecracker salesman. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=198.02s)]
*  I thought that was pretty good. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=200.58s)]
*  That is funny. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=201.5s)]
*  Hey, listen, there's something in the news. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=202.38000000000002s)]
*  Did you hear what Bruce Springsteen had to say about the current president? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=203.9s)]
*  I did. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=207.18s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=208.06s)]
*  Oh, my God. Just another person with TDS at the highest levels. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=209.34s)]
*  I mean, to be in Europe talking junk about our president who gets up and works his ass off [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=213.74s)]
*  for this country every day and his administration is doing such great things. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=218.34s)]
*  I mean, thank God for him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=221.62s)]
*  But to do that in Europe, you know, what a punk move. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=222.66000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know, this guy's got what, five hundred million, a billion dollars, you know, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=225.5s)]
*  and out there playing like he's a working class hero. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=230.86s)]
*  And really, to me, just wants to be, you know, in good standings with the Hollywood elite. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  Right. And I'm proud to say that I'm more of Hollywood's kryptonite. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=238.3s)]
*  I can verify that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  If you missed what he said, here's the boss. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  There has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  It's currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  They are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=267.54s)]
*  through abandoning our great allies. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=274.66s)]
*  Exciting with dictators. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=280.98s)]
*  Well, what do you think of that? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=286.02s)]
*  Garbage, garbage, tedious at the highest level. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he's over there creating peace in the Middle East. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=291.02s)]
*  You know, one of the places that could possibly erupt and send the world into turmoil. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  And he's over there getting it done. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=299.46s)]
*  Not only, you know, getting great deals for our country, which I've told everybody, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  I got people at high levels working in financial world. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=304.5s)]
*  And when he's doing that stuff, they're all freaking out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=307.62s)]
*  I'm like, just give him a minute. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=309.5s)]
*  I'm like, this guy does not know how to lose. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  Period. Gets up every morning. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=312.82s)]
*  I mean, it busts his ass for this country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=315.06s)]
*  Thank God for him and his administration. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=316.82s)]
*  Well, he's getting a lot of business done and signed up a lot of contracts for American stuff. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=318.7s)]
*  Speaking of business, you got a new place in Nashville. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=323.62s)]
*  Yeah, the Detroit Cowboy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=326.5s)]
*  It's a collaboration with Joe Muir and high end seafood and steaks. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  But we're not in competition with anyone. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=332.5s)]
*  Anything I do, I'm not in competition. I'm doing my own thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=334.97999999999996s)]
*  This is the only place where you can go and, you know, be stared at by a picture [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=337.73999999999995s)]
*  of me and Dolly Parton while eating a tomahawk [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=342.06s)]
*  rib eye as big as a newborn baby while Bob Seeger and Loretta Lynn play over the speakers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=345.06s)]
*  The place sounds great. And what's it called? The Detroit Cowboy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=349.62s)]
*  All right. We're going to we're going to wind up showing up there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=352.3s)]
*  Listen, Bobby Ainsley, Brian and Lawrence are back in New York on the couch. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=354.46s)]
*  And they got some questions for you. Who's first? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=359.9s)]
*  Ainsley. Well, I love you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=363.1s)]
*  And I think you're amazing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=365.7s)]
*  And I like that you don't care what anyone else thinks. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=367.22s)]
*  So we're going to have to take a trip down to the Detroit Cowboy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=369.9s)]
*  What do you think of this cowboy right here? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=373.06s)]
*  Lawrence Lawrence is our Dallas cowboy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=374.65999999999997s)]

*  Our motto is go where you celebrate it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=387.58s)]
*  That's right. Hey, kid, real quickly, you famously brokered [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=389.58s)]
*  peace between Bill Maher and the commander in chief, Donald J. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=394.06s)]
*  Trump. After that summit, he spoke highly of the president. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=398.06s)]
*  He's still liberal, but he says he was one of the most fascinating people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=401.94s)]
*  that he's he's met. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=405.82s)]
*  Do you think there's hope for peace when it comes to the Democrats now? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=407.62s)]
*  I think there's hope for reason. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=414.46s)]
*  I keep stressing reasonable people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=417.5s)]
*  I think there's a lot of hope for reasonable people of this country [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=419.14s)]
*  to understand the oldest cliche that we can agree to disagree. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=422.38s)]
*  We can have different thoughts and opinions and we don't have to hate [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  each other, you know, all the time. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=429.14000000000004s)]
*  We can talk a little smack about each other. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=430.94000000000005s)]
*  That's OK. You know, people talk smack about me every day on the left. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=432.70000000000005s)]
*  And that's fine. I'm from the school of sticks and stones. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  And I know President Trump is too, and so many other people. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  So my hope is just, you know, that Bill Maher is a reasonable guy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=441.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's about as far left as you can get, but he is a reasonable person. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=444.42s)]
*  So to get them together and watch them, you know, share what they had in common [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=448.22s)]
*  and agree on some things and also, you know, have some tough questions [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=452.5s)]
*  and conversations was just, you know, that's that's the America I know and I love. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=455.94s)]
*  So, Ken, one thing that you do is, you know, the president personally, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=460.78s)]
*  when something like somebody like Bruce Springsteen says what he says [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=465.98s)]
*  and if he gets comes global news, do you think that bothers him? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=469.58s)]
*  I mean, guys got a lot on his mind, obviously. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=476.38s)]
*  I mean, I don't think at the end of the day it's affecting him too, too, too harshly. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=478.62s)]
*  But, you know, you just kind of laugh it off and go, what's the matter with these people? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=484.02s)]
*  You know, that they've got to be in a foreign country talking junk about, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=487.82s)]
*  you know, the America we're in right now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=491.38s)]
*  It's like you couldn't find something positive to say that there's nothing that's man. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=493.41999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this the Bill Maher thing is a perfect example. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=497.74s)]
*  To me, that was something very positive, no matter if you're left, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=500.46s)]
*  if you're right or anything in the mainstream media outside of your organization. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, just just totally disregarded it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=507.7s)]
*  Not one mention of it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=511.02s)]
*  I mean, that's a problem in this country. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=512.82s)]
*  To me, the media is public enemy number one at this point. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=514.6600000000001s)]
*  I think it's like they keep on emphasizing this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=517.62s)]
*  Yeah, you can tell that Bobby's show is patriotic. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8bKxkoSXI&t=521.6600000000001s)]
