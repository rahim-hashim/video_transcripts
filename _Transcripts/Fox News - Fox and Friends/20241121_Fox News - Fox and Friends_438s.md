# 'Clown': Hosts shocked by liberal mayor's message to Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI)
*  Yesterday, I don't know if y'all were like many like I you know [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=0.0s)]
*  I follow crime and I was watching this Lake and Riley case. We've all been interested in that [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=3.98s)]
*  We want her to have justice. It was on hyperspeed the whole case [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=9.02s)]
*  It was so she was murdered in February and then this this just flew through the courts. The judge took it [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=12.72s)]
*  He sentenced him [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=18.38s)]
*  It took him 20 minutes to find him guilty on all counts and the brutal death of Lake and Riley and he never changed his facial [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=19.1s)]
*  His facial expression Jose Ibarro after all these years were piling up [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  He received two life sentences without the possibility of parole plus 27 years, right? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=30.84s)]
*  He's never getting out of you know in his defense [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=36.0s)]
*  Through the pretty much everything out there. They said, you know the evidence [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=39.32s)]
*  Including his thumbprint and his DNA under her fingernails. That was circumstantial [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=43.8s)]
*  Inconsistential inconclusive they said his brother that man right there's brother who shared an apartment with him could have done it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=48.68s)]
*  Said the brother is actually taller and more athletic and Jose the guy who was convicted yesterday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=56.44s)]
*  Short and chubby and she could outrun him but the judge listened to all of it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=61.4s)]
*  It was a bench trial instead of a jury because they would not get a change of venue [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=67.12s)]
*  They would not take it out of that region because they didn't want that to be the jury pool [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=71.48s)]
*  But the judge himself listened to all of it and said, okay, this is slam dunk. This is an easy case [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=75.92s)]
*  Guilty guilty guilty. Here's the governor of Georgia [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=81.36s)]
*  This one hits close to home for us, you know, you know [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=86.24s)]
*  Marty and the girls and I live in Athens, Georgia. We know the judge [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=90.0s)]
*  We know the deputy that was standing right there in the courtroom [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=93.32s)]
*  We know the Phillips and Riley families our daughter's a senior at the University of Georgia [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=96.72s)]
*  And I mean even when I was on campus both Marty and I have been in the area where Lakin lost her life [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=102.04s)]
*  I can't tell you how many times [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=108.2s)]
*  It is a bittersweet day [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=111.0s)]
*  This is a tragic event as you and your colleagues have been saying never should have happened [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=112.68s)]
*  But it did because the bad policies of this administration [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=118.84s)]
*  Which is quite honestly outrageous, but I am thankful that justice was swift here and the judge moved so quickly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=122.6s)]
*  President Biden is not called over from the White House is weighed in that I know of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=129.28s)]
*  Except that when they're forced to and during the State of the Union [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene yelled out what about say her name? What about Lakin or and he mispronounced it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=136.72s)]
*  But President Biden easily could put his office yesterday was saluting an abortion queen [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  And gave her the gave her an award. They could have easily had another email out to say [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  We watched the dramatic incidents in the tragic death of Lakin Riley or Hartman [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  Riley or Hart goes out to him, but it just don't seem interested [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=158.16s)]
*  You know, I'm shocked that you know, we just had an election where this is the number two issue and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=161.56s)]
*  The country spoke up you got over 60% of the country that is for mass [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=167.2s)]
*  Deportations now there's a clear view of where we stand as a country [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=171.64s)]
*  We're unified on this issue pretty much but all of these liberal mayors and governors have not changed their position at all [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=175.12s)]
*  It's like we don't care that the voters said this we're gonna double down [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah, they showed yesterday in court the body cam footage of Lakin's family on the side of the road finding out that she had died [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=185.82s)]
*  And the mom is saying is she alive? It's my daughter. Is she alive and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  And then you hear from Donald Trump. Like you said he's on truth social [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  He says our hearts will always be with you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  It is time to secure our border and remove these criminals and thugs from our country [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  so nothing like this can happen again and then the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  The mayor of Denver Mike Johnston is saying we're gonna maintain our sanctuary city status and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  We're not gonna put up with mass deportations from Donald Trump in January [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=219.62s)]
*  Illegals are allowed to stay here and we will protect them. Look at this clown [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=224.62s)]
*  He says this more than us having Denver Police Department station at the county line to keep them out [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=228.58s)]
*  You would have 50,000 Denverites there [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=233.46s)]
*  It's like the Tiananmen Square moment when the Rose and the gun, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=236.18s)]
*  You'd hate every one of those Highland moms who came out for the migrants and you do not want to mess with them [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  Really? You really think a lot of those moms that saw the Lakeland Riley trial thought [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=245.9s)]
*  I just hope my daughter gives stays in danger [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=250.26s)]
*  And if you're seen with this guy's allowed to happen to his sanctuary city per capita [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  The most overrun city with illegal immigrants in the country and this guy's standing behind it you talk to him [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=257.3s)]
*  Yes, so Steve [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=264.7s)]
*  We talked to the mayor a few months ago [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=266.74s)]
*  We had a great interview and remember we were confused by this and we actually reached out for him to come on the program again [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=268.94s)]
*  Hopefully it come on tomorrow to explain because he told us this before but now it looks like he's changed his position watch [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=274.9s)]
*  At what point does your city reach its breaking point? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=281.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think our city is very close to its breaking point now [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  And we've been talking to leaders in DC around the country about why we need to take action here [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=289.4s)]
*  I think we have successfully welcomed of almost 40,000 migrants in the last year and and we know what it takes to do this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=293.68s)]
*  Successfully, we just need that help and the things we need are yes [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=299.68s)]
*  We need federal dollars [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=303.32s)]
*  But the most important thing is we need you know work authorization for folks when they arrive and we need those resources at the border [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=304.24s)]
*  So you can add more security at the border [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=309.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=311.76s)]
*  Resources is it because he got backlash from interviewing. I don't know how about his Trump's president [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=313.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, but what did he ask for right there? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=318.56s)]
*  He said we need more stuff at the border obviously to process more people coming in and he said that Denver needed more money [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=320.74s)]
*  To house more migrants. So, you know ultimately to your larger point Lawrence talking about the election elections have consequences [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=327.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they do all across the country and even people in big towns like this. Yeah just said, you know [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=335.34s)]
*  We're we're sick of this crap. We got to fix it [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=340.06s)]
*  And if you're not gonna fix it mayor's fill in the blank, we're gonna get somebody in there who will yeah [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=342.88s)]
*  I love this quote. I think we're gonna continue to be a welcoming open big-hearted city. That's gonna stand by our values [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=349.16s)]
*  Yes, no changes. We won't change. We're not gonna sell out our values pledge to keep protecting illegals. I [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=355.88s)]
*  Hope he agrees to come on tomorrow because he's considered a star within the party. I just want to understand the evolution [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=363.96s)]
*  I mean if these couldn't get more worse when it comes to his city [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=369.72s)]
*  So why now why the change right now when you have an administration has come in this is they want to work with Democrats [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=374.72s)]
*  They want to get this problem resolved [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=381.42s)]
*  Why why is he now being so vocal like this at the top of that sound bite that just played with you? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=383.24s)]
*  And he in the chambers there in Denver. He said the city is close to the breaking point. Mm-hmm [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  I got news for him. It's broken [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=394.6s)]
*  And home have said they're gonna start with the illegal criminals. Right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  Are they there for the harbour the legal criminals here in our country if we can't get the mayor let's get Elway back [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=400.88s)]
*  He'll tell us the reality of a business owner they haven't learned anything [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=408.24s)]
*  I mean Donald Trump swept this election because of this it's common sense [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=411.56s)]
*  illegal criminals, I guess they feel like Colorado are you suggesting that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=416.2s)]
*  Politicians have common sense because that I can get the Fox News alert animation ready. There are a few of them. Yeah, I'm Steve [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8c_aUr-xpI&t=420.88s)]
