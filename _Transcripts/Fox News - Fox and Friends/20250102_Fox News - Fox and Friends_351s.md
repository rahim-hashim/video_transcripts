# 'Lucky to be alive': New Orleans terror attack witness shares story
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA)
*  As the FBI and local law enforcement piece together what exactly happened witnesses are speaking out including our next guest who captured this video and says he's lucky to be alive here to share his story is Alex. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=0.0s)]
*  Birth Mitchell Alex welcome to you first off tell us about that about that video what was happening in that moment that you're taking it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=12.6s)]
*  It was honestly kind of surreal I I took it because I. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=20.16s)]
*  I didn't know what was going on I knew that something currently was still going on I knew that I had to get out and get a be OK I also tried to figure out how to get down there and help. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=29.88s)]
*  Because I couldn't go where I can do anything and the police wouldn't let us and then looking back on it makes sense you know it's a terrorist event so. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=42.96s)]
*  It's an ongoing threat what if I'm you know I could be the threat I get it but it was just very stressful hectic and I also felt like I'm just I recorded that just for the world to know what's going on this is crazy I need to prove to my family know that I was alive. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=50.36s)]
*  And then. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=66.48s)]
*  I was also just wanted to know like this is insane I didn't know what to do honestly. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=69.24s)]
*  Incredible Alex I know that you have said you feel lucky to be alive and I'm sure your family feels the same and I know you're giving credit to the fact that you are wearing a wristband from one of the clubs why did that help you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=73.76s)]
*  All right actually I've been to some of the clubs earlier that the night we wanted to get out and we go walking but. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  I noticed my watch is telling me you've been walking so long you want to record a workout and I was like man we're just walking really doing nothing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=94.68s)]
*  And it's fun to be out in there but we've already been some of the clubs like this you know go in there and enjoy it while we're out here and set a feeling to go back inside so the wristband got us back in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=102.76s)]
*  It was no there was a line outside we could show the wristband show ID again get scanned through by the metal detectors and you were fine to go in. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=112.44s)]
*  So I got in and out of there and if I would have waited maybe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=122.4s)]
*  No more than a minute I could have been out there hurt injured. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=127.08s)]
*  No more than a minute I could have been out there hurt injured. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=131.0s)]
*  Dead I'm lucky to be alive the wristbands but let's get back in quickly and easily but I just wanted to go back in and just didn't feel like being out on the street anymore. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=137.12s)]
*  Maybe that saved me and I also still feel guilty that I couldn't help her that other people didn't make it out you know so on one hand you're happy the other hand you're. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=146.84s)]
*  Feel terrible inside of course you saw so much and 15 lives are lost and it was obvious tragedy for anyone who witnessed it including yourself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=157.64s)]
*  I know this was your first time out for New Year's Eve did you say. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes ma'am yes ma'am just always working I've been the one doing Uber Lyft or working in the hotel you're working on whatever job. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  Was making sure that I could supply support me my family and but people some I don't I don't want to go out enough I don't I don't have enough fun and being out there of time so I wanted to go out and have some fun and it's not how I expected the New Year's to go by any means and I was having a great night. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  So yes I'm grateful to be alive but I wish that I could say the same for others. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=197.76s)]
*  It's hard to see that it's really hard to see that and no other people won't. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=203.44s)]
*  See their families again or they won't see their loved ones. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=206.96s)]
*  It's just terrible. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=211.76s)]
*  Devastating honestly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=213.56s)]
*  So anything before you go Alex that you wanted to add to what you've seen reported so far having been an eyewitness of the scene there what you want people to know about what you were able to see. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  What you want people to know about what you were able to see. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=225.52s)]
*  The one hand I don't want anyone to see it as like oh you can't come here and have fun. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=232.84s)]
*  I mean something like this happened in Germany just last week for Christmas. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=237.84s)]
*  So it doesn't really matter where you can go or you can have fun. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=242.36s)]
*  I don't want people to think that you can't have live your life and can't have fun. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  Someone told me if you live life like that then we're letting the terrorists win you know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  We're feeding into the terror like being scared to go out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  That's that's their end game is to create terror and panic and fear. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=255.44s)]
*  So I want to live my life and be happy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=259.32s)]
*  So I'm not upset that I went out but I'm upset that this kind of stuff happens. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=263.0s)]
*  I just want everyone to know to love love your loved ones. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=270.76s)]
*  Have a good time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=274.36s)]
*  Don't be scared to live your life. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=275.68s)]
*  Don't be scared to live your life. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  But at the same time check on your loved ones and just hold them close because you never know when can be your last day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=279.24s)]
*  And you just really don't know when today can be your last day. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=288.48s)]
*  We hear you Alex and your friend Jimmy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  Is he OK. I know he was the one who wanted you to go out that night. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah Jimmy and I are good. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm glad Jimmy was there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=301.88s)]
*  I'm really glad Jimmy got me out of the house. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  And then it ended up being like hey Jimmy let's go back inside. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Like I know you want to be out and about having a good time on the street but yeah I've been having a good time in the clubs and had this wristband we already paid for. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's go back in. And that was a great decision. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  So I took care of me and my friend at that point. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=318.0s)]
*  But I wish that there could be more lives saved. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=320.8s)]
*  That's all I can tell you. And. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=324.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=328.16s)]
*  I mean Jimmy you're good. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lg2qn26igA&t=328.44000000000005s)]
