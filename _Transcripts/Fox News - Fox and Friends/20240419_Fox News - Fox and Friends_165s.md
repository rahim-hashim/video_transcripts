# Jack Keane: Biden doesn't have the stomach for this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M)
*  All right, that is Secretary of State Anthony Blinken talking about progress and symbiosis at g7 and what they have to do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a huge agenda. It's a consequential agenda [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=7.38s)]
*  A lot of major decisions are going to be made right now and hopefully an aid package passed this weekend [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=9.44s)]
*  Let's bring in all four-star general Jack Keane general your takeaway first off on what he did and didn't say [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=14.76s)]
*  About the strike last night. He did not confirm anything about the strike [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=22.16s)]
*  Just mentioned they condemned the attack last weekend on Iran on is Iran's attack on Israel [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=25.939999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean the important thing is there are going to be some sanctions coming forward certainly [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=34.42s)]
*  Missiles drones he mentioned the steel industry all of that is worthwhile [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  But he left out what is really given Iran the money that they have their flush with money and what's that from oil? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=43.86s)]
*  Oil oil oil oil and that should be our focus [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=50.9s)]
*  We need secondary sanctions going after the Chinese companies that are buying all of that oil [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  We got to step up here and get on with this the previous administration had a run in the tank [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=60.5s)]
*  With two hundred thousand three hundred thousand barrels of oil a day now [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=66.18s)]
*  It's close to four million barrels of oil a day [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=70.18s)]
*  No wonder they have all the money to buy ballistic missiles rockets and other [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  Long-range missiles for their proxies because they're flush with this money and it's unfortunate. We're not going after that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=78.98s)]
*  I don't think we have the stuff. You know why you know why because it's all about China, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=85.5s)]
*  Because it'll raise the goal [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=90.18s)]
*  It'll raise the price of oil if you start [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  stopping production of Iranian oil and the last thing the president wants for his political fortunes is the price of gas to go up but [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  He did mention China when it comes to Ukraine, and he also mentioned that China is backing up and helping Russia rebuild [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=100.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I'm delighted he mentioned that and how [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=109.22s)]
*  Comprehensive China's support is to Russia's defense industrial base [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=114.34s)]
*  I mean they're not giving them platforms [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  But they're giving them everything to help build a platform and do all the other things you need to keep a military on the battlefield [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=121.02000000000001s)]
*  It is really quite extensive the support that they're providing and we're not doing anything about it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=128.02s)]
*  But we're not taking China on over that issue other than rhetoric [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=134.8s)]
*  It's crazy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=139.16s)]
*  We get halfway everywhere and we don't pull the trigger [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=140.56s)]
*  General Jack Keane, we scrambled your early changed everything because the attack right here in Iran last night. We still got to find out details [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMKVtriX5M&t=144.68s)]
