# Democrat pulls all-nighter protesting Trump, Musk on Senate floor
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY)
*  Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about while you were sleeping. It all started about let's see 11 hours ago [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=0.0s)]
*  It looked just like that Cory Booker the senator from the state of New Jersey [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=6.32s)]
*  Started a marathon speech and he made it very clear [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=12.24s)]
*  He said I'm gonna keep going as long as I'm physically able and what he's doing and is doing live right now as he puts [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=14.84s)]
*  On his glasses is he's talking about the actions taken by Donald Trump over his administration thus far [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=21.72s)]
*  Not happy about any of it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=28.3s)]
*  But keep in mind he's part of the Democratic leadership in the Senate and Democrats are under pressure from their base to do more to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=30.3s)]
*  Stand up to Donald Trump. How does this work? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=37.62s)]
*  He's standing up against Donald Trump, you know Donald Trump is down the street. Do the senators all have to be there [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=39.62s)]
*  No, you have to stay there all night [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=45.06s)]
*  Speaking to anyone nobody he just wants national maybe he has a few fans [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, there are a couple other senators who occasionally ask him questions and he yields the floor [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=51.739999999999995s)]
*  But by yielding for a question that he still controls the floor. This is not a filibuster [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=57.3s)]
*  So here is what did you miss last night when you made that dumb decision to sleep? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=68.42s)]
*  I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=78.46s)]
*  We are not solving the deficit in what they're proposing here [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=82.3s)]
*  They're cutting and cutting and cutting things that make no sense to cut and they're doing it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=85.72s)]
*  For a tax breaks which disproportionately go to the wealthiest placing tariffs on our biggest trade partners is beyond unfair [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=93.92s)]
*  This drives the cost of goods up and the consumer is want the one who ends up paying the increase [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=101.4s)]
*  Even with universities got too woke and had two excesses the antidote to that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=107.44s)]
*  Isn't to try to shut down the thought of the left [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  It's to try to make a fair more competitive marketplace for ideas from all around the political spectrum. How would you do that? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=116.06s)]
*  I mean, there's just several things that he said is just not true [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=122.78s)]
*  He's still running on the tax cut for the rich not true and most Americans [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=126.58s)]
*  Understand it and they believe that under the past administration when Donald Trump had his first term that they got a tax break [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=131.9s)]
*  They know that to be true. He also talks about the universe's campuses [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=138.3s)]
*  So you're gonna side with the people that are blocking the Jews from going to class right now [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=142.04s)]
*  That's not gonna work with the American people and just over and over the talking points if you want to get [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  The American people attention you don't do it on the floor of the Senate you go and you start talking with voters [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=152.48s)]
*  I'm not sure he's gonna town hall. Yeah, I'm not sure this is gonna get much attention [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=159.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we're probably the only people to cover in this right now [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=163.0s)]
*  I don't think the American people care what he's saying on the floor right now. I think he just wants to be relevant [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=166.04s)]
*  The progressive group has gotten so much attention lately [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=171.84s)]
*  I think he's seeing like all these younger people or people who were who are new in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=175.04s)]
*  Congress get all this attention like AOC she's not new but she's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=180.28s)]
*  Always out there Jasmine Crockett is new. We're hearing a lot from her [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=184.24s)]
*  I think she he's doing this so that we all covered on the morning show and he gets some [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=187.52s)]
*  Look, I would just bring up one other thing if you want attention [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=192.84s)]
*  Lindsey Graham showed you the template John McCain showed you the template Joe Manchin showed you the template [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=195.96s)]
*  You go out and you make news you say things that are relevant and then the old the reporters following around, you know [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=200.6s)]
*  He'll revolve on and everybody else say go. Okay, we got to get this interview, but just doing a filibuster saying [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=205.94s)]
*  I really have no agenda. I'm just gonna rail against the administration [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=211.04s)]
*  Overnight, it's like I'm volunteering to do something with no one's watching. It's so congratulations [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't know who your PR guy is. Well, just go stay active. He has been active [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=220.84s)]
*  He's been going at it for 11 hours and 12 minutes but if he wants to break the record [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=225.62s)]
*  He's got to go another let's see another 13 hours because strong Thurman actually broke the record [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=230.74s)]
*  He holds the record he talked filibustered for 24 hours in 18 minutes back [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=236.86s)]
*  I'm Nancy Pelosi 1957 right he struck Thurman was railing against the Civil Rights Act [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=242.3s)]
*  Remember when Nancy Pelosi did it and there's like four inch high heels all night, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  That's a workout but I would say this next hour we will play that strong Thurman filibuster [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkoVG6ORHY&t=253.04s)]
