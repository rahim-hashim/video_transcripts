# Biden-Harris admin is 'embarrassed' they let this happen: Velicovich
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y)
*  Meanwhile Fox News or the Afghan National arrested for allegedly planning an election day attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Was reportedly directed by Isis K and sources now telling Fox that he was not [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=5.28s)]
*  Thoroughly vetted after claiming last week. They had three separate background checks [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=11.6s)]
*  What are we to believe our next guest was on the team that tracked and killed the original leader of Isis al-bagdadi [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=16.44s)]
*  And now knows how the terror group operates Fox News contributor former special operations Intel analyst bread Velikovic [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=22.92s)]
*  Joins us now Brett. What bothers you the most about this? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=29.88s)]
*  Well, what bothers me is that Isis is still out there planning and we've really just taken our eyes off them Isis never left [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=33.92s)]
*  Brian we just really stopped our focus [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=40.76s)]
*  I spent nearly a decade hunting Isis leaders and I can tell you they're far from done the Isis caliphate may have been destroyed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=42.7s)]
*  Territorially, but myself and other experts in this field have said for years that if we're not careful we get this false sense of security [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=49.44s)]
*  It's gonna get worse and it seems like daily this administration makes another move globally to continue to leave us vulnerable [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=55.28s)]
*  By taking the boots off the neck of our enemies [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=61.36s)]
*  We've removed some of our best soldiers our best intelligence resources from strategic locations across the Middle East and Africa and these current issues [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=63.72s)]
*  We're dealing with right now with these threats [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=71.6s)]
*  It largely goes back to our botched Afghanistan withdrawal people thought that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=73.2s)]
*  Leaving the region and taking our eyes off the enemy would be the conclusion of Isis that somehow we can just turn our backs out [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=77.88s)]
*  There and the threat is just gonna magically go away and that's not how it works [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=83.84s)]
*  They just regroup they wait and and who do we leave America's security to over there in Afghanistan the Taliban? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=86.9s)]
*  Like they're gonna keep Isis K in check for us [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=92.18s)]
*  Like that's a group that was formed after a more hardline faction of the Taliban splintered off [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=94.94s)]
*  So what our leaders thought this was just a great idea [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean Brian there are very real and disastrous [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=102.28s)]
*  Consequences for letting our guard down and allowing groups like Isis K to operate unchecked and we've got people in power now at our [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=106.16s)]
*  Levels in the US government who haven't even set foot on the battlefield [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=112.8s)]
*  They have no idea how much of our intelligence has been lost. We've removed our eyes and ears [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=116.04s)]
*  And guess what it's gonna get worse because we're pulling out of Africa Iraq, too [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=119.92s)]
*  So we'll have nobody and no insight over there just about a few hundred people in Syria [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=124.44s)]
*  Evidently in the charging document [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=130.44s)]
*  They say to eat he was communicating with a guy overseas named Malik who has direct links to Isis K [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=132.28s)]
*  And they look like he was trying to do something like was done in the in the concert hall at Crocus City Hall [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  They killed 130 in Moscow and there was also a mass shooting over in Iran [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=143.88s)]
*  So kill hold on tight for Election Day next over some of our most [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=148.68s)]
*  Secret military bases and military sites. We've had sophisticated huge drones [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=154.0s)]
*  hovering over top and we're watching these drones watch us and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  All we do is meet in the situation room the Biden administration and decide what to do and so far it's nothing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=165.26s)]
*  17 days of drones over our sites including nuclear sites and we elect to do nothing. Why I [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=171.82s)]
*  Don't know why this topic frankly hasn't gotten more coverage. I mean what this happened over 17 times [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean these surveillance drones really they're designed to gather pattern of life on the target to see where we are vulnerable to understand [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  What happened over there and frankly I believe that this was a foreign government testing us testing our responses [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=192.62s)]
*  They wanted to see if they can get away with it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=199.06s)]
*  And they did remember the the Chinese spy balloons circling our atmosphere that took our government years to figure out foreign adversaries [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  They can easily control these drones from thousands of miles away through special [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=207.58s)]
*  technical relays that allow them to surveil our most important military sites and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=212.9s)]
*  Frankly this needs to be a wake-up call for this administration because the real question is how many times did this occur before or even? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=217.22s)]
*  Without the US government even knowing why are we learning about this now? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=223.44s)]
*  And it's probably because they're embarrassed they're embarrassed that this happened why we really do much about it [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=226.72s)]
*  Why don't we just shoot it down and if it's an American if it's if it's some hobbyist or it's some American [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Tough and if I walked on a military base and I'm innocent [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=238.54s)]
*  I just want to see the military base and they tell me to stop and I don't and I get shot [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=241.78s)]
*  It's on me you fly a drone over a military site and it gets blown up and it ends up being something friendly [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=245.62s)]
*  It's not my problem. I can't take the risk real quick [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=252.62s)]
*  Well exactly we have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=256.7s)]
*  Problems with archaic laws within our country that don't allow us to actually shoot these things down [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=258.62s)]
*  We have the technology to do it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=263.22s)]
*  But we haven't put enough money into this industry to actually create these layers that can stop these drones [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=264.62s)]
*  So, you know the White House frankly just was caught with its pants down because they haven't been focused on this which [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=269.46s)]
*  They should have called you you would know how to do it. Thanks so much Brett 15 minutes now before the top of the hour [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rma-jVP9U0Y&t=275.14s)]
