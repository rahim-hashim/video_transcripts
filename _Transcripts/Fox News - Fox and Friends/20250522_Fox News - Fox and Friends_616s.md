*  Anti-semitic murderer I have instructed to strengthen security arrangements at Israel's missions worldwide and the protection of the state's representatives [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=121.12s)]
*  Here's Israel's ambassador to the United States on the couple [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=128.24s)]
*  the couple that was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  gunned down tonight in the name of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  free Palestine [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=137.0s)]
*  It's a young couple about to be engaged [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  To his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem together. We won't be afraid together will stand and we're gonna overcome [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  Moral depravity of people who think that they're going to achieve political gains through murder [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  DC police have ID'd the shooter's 30 year old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago a spokeswoman at the Israeli Embassy just said yesterday [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=162.44s)]
*  She was laughing with your own and Sarah over coffee and now all that remains was that photo and instead of walking down the aisle [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=169.52s)]
*  She said we are walking with you to your graves guys [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=175.52s)]
*  Brian so so Lucas, let me ask you a quick question [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  The shooting happens outside this gunman not only doesn't try to walk away [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=184.44s)]
*  Not only doesn't try to walk away he walks in inside and then that's where we pick up the video [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=187.92s)]
*  Anything else about his behavior and why do you think that people think he acted alone? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=193.0s)]
*  Was interesting Brian it did not appear that the suspect was tackled perhaps that happened earlier in the video. We just didn't see it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=198.24s)]
*  but the shooter he according to our last guest on Fox and Friends first went to University of Illinois and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=205.56s)]
*  It's interesting, you know, he's dressed very casually his name is Elias Rodriguez 30 years old [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Just don't know enough about him at the time [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=219.88s)]
*  But the fact that he was able to sit there and yell at the press. I think some people might take umbrage with that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=222.56s)]
*  All right Lucas. Thank you so much [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=229.68s)]
*  It's hard to watch that video knowing he allegedly just gunned down a couple that was about to be engaged in a hateful act [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=231.48s)]
*  And then walks inside and starts chanting that after he had just taken two lives allegedly [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=239.4s)]
*  We're gonna be learning more information [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  About this attack who he was connected with what chatter was online [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  What was his digital footprint how he became radicalized? Yeah, did he make any foreign trips? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=252.88s)]
*  But there's something that I think is pretty much the elephant in the room is because I've been on these college campuses [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=258.08s)]
*  They've been chanting free Palestine [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=263.88s)]
*  Taking over campuses for a while Brian and what I'm afraid is that free Palestine is becoming the new Allah Akbar [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  These kids don't understand what they've been chanting. They've been having these kaffirs on but there are certain members [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=274.32s)]
*  It appears that are becoming radical [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=279.96s)]
*  What do I? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=282.44s)]
*  Intelligent agents know about that and what we're gonna do to crack down on that should be the objective of the administration this morning Brian [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=283.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it looks random but it doesn't look like the event is random [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=291.06s)]
*  They know where to find Jewish Americans or Jews and that's why he went number two is immediately [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=295.14s)]
*  You have to worry about other embassies other sites [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=300.82s)]
*  I know ambassador Danny Deneune is gonna be on with us shortly governor Huckabee also now ambassador Huckabee in Israel [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=303.06s)]
*  It's got to worry about all Israeli and US embassies around the world and I know we're gonna respond to that pretty strongly [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  But I do say this I think it's also noteworthy that immediately [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=315.66s)]
*  This is a hands-on administration [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  Judge an imperial was on the scene to go see exactly what happened what led to it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  So you don't need second or third-hand to count Ainsley, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=326.14000000000004s)]
*  We know with her at the helm this will be taken care of that guy if he is convicted [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  He'll be locked up for a very long time if not worse [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=334.62s)]
*  The event was hosted by the American Jewish Committee the AJC [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=338.22s)]
*  It was for young Jewish professionals in foreign policy. And here's the irony [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  They were there to hear a panel discussion focused on finding humanitarian solutions for Gaza [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=346.94s)]
*  So if you have a problem with what's happening in the war between Israel and Hamas [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=352.94s)]
*  Why would the solution be to come to America and shoot two individuals who happen to just be from Israel and representing Israel? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=358.14s)]
*  Let's bring in Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Deneune. He is with us this morning. Thank you so much for waking up with us [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=365.66s)]
*  Thank you so much for waking up with us [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=372.14s)]
*  I know you posted yesterday on X or lat in the middle of the night [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=373.9s)]
*  You said the shooting was a depraved act of anti-semitic terrorism harming diplomats and the Jewish community is crossing a red line [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=377.26s)]
*  We are confident that the US authorities will take strong action against those responsible for this criminal act. That's in part what you wrote [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=384.53999999999996s)]
*  So, what do you want the US authorities to do? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=391.5s)]
*  Well, we expect actions not only declarations [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=395.58s)]
*  You know, I trust our allies that they will take actions against this guy who committed this horrific crime [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  But it's not enough. We need to look at the incitement. You know, we have spoken about it in the past [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=406.82s)]
*  What's happening today on campuses, you know? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=411.3s)]
*  Chanting death to Israel death to the Jewish people, you know, Jewish students are not safe anymore [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  That must stop. You know, I believe that the universities [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=420.5s)]
*  Became the place where you have the incitement spread all over [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  And not only on campuses I can tell you at the united nations only this week [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=428.02s)]
*  We are the union official [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=432.18s)]
*  Glaming israel for committing a genocide for killing 14 000 palestinian babies [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  All the lies spread out and I think we have to fight the incitement. Not only the terrorists to commit those crimes [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=439.7s)]
*  You know, mr. Ambassador [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=446.74s)]
*  Some of the hostages that were held said that there was some communication [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=448.9s)]
*  Between the people that are on these college campuses in these groups at hamas [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=453.72s)]
*  We hear the stuff that they've been saying on the call calling for a global antifada [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=458.68s)]
*  Do you worry that our ignorance to what was happening on the college campus has now turned to terror? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=463.16s)]
*  Do you have any intelligence from your side that you have shared with the united states that says these are dangerous hotbeds? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=470.6s)]
*  That we have just allowed to roam our streets [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  We are sharing all the intelligence we have with our counterparts in dc [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=481.0s)]
*  And I agree with you, you know, it's all connected [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=486.52s)]
*  It's pure hate when you hear the iranian leaders inciting to destroy the jewish nation the jewish people [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=488.68s)]
*  And then you you hear those chanting on campuses and you see that the leadership of the universities they sit idly by they ignore it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=495.56s)]
*  Well, why if you ignore it, that's what happened last night [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=503.56s)]
*  You allow those crazy lunatics taking actions against innocent americans, you know, who came to to learn about diplomacy [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=506.76s)]
*  Today it was not an attack against us [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=514.52s)]
*  It was attacked against the american values and i'm sure that our partners will know how to fight it [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=516.36s)]
*  And now to make sure that the jews will feel safe again in the u.s [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=521.88s)]
*  Yeah, and you could directly draw a line from what's happening on campuses and keep in mind this guy's 30 years old [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=527.56s)]
*  And makhmud khalil is 30 years old. This is what he said ambassador when the cops came to him [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=533.48s)]
*  He said I did this sir. I'm unarmed, which is a lie [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=538.84s)]
*  He puts his hands up. He grabs a red khafid out of his pocket and started to chant free palestine [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=542.36s)]
*  He's proud of it. What's consistent with that with october 7th [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=548.44s)]
*  They are proud of it if cat if there are people caught in the crossfire and there are [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=552.12s)]
*  And people die innocent people die the israelis [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  Investigate and they apologize. It's never the intention with the palestinians and hamas. It's the intention [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  That's a major difference people seem to be forgetting [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely brian and moreover you should look at the way everything was planned, you know four days ago [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxtJwYXX0LY&t=571.46s)]
