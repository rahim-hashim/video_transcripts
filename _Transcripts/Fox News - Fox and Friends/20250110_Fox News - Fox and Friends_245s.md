# DeSantis BLASTS media for fire coverage: 'They're trying to pin this on Trump'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU)
*  So President-elect Trump hosted a group of Republican governors at Mar-a-Lago last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=0.0s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was there and he joins us now. Governor, thanks so much for joining [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=4.88s)]
*  the program. Good morning. So Governor, you know, everyone has been saying, you know, if Ron DeSantis [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=8.8s)]
*  were in California and there was a disaster like this, there would be great criticism, but we know [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=15.44s)]
*  that you would handle this differently. You had this interesting exchange with a reporter yesterday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=21.12s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=26.08s)]
*  So why aren't they criticizing him or the mayor? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=26.72s)]
*  Well, here's my point is just simply, you know, they were trying to pin this on Donald Trump and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  they were going after Donald Trump's comments. And I'm just thinking to myself, I've seen how [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=62.64s)]
*  these people in the press react to when these things happen in the state of Florida. All they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=67.36s)]
*  try to do is define things that they can create negative narratives about. I remember when we had [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=73.36s)]
*  Hurricane Ian, category five monster storm hit Southwest Florida. All they were looking for were [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=78.56s)]
*  things to do negative. And the reality was the state was prepared. We had an overwhelming [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=85.12s)]
*  response. We were doing things like rebuilding bridges in three days. We were able to bring [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=89.44s)]
*  the power back on and millions of people in record time. And so once it was clear that people were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  satisfied with the response after a few days, you couldn't find CNN in the state of Florida if you [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=100.56s)]
*  had a search warrant. I mean, they were just gone. They had no interest in covering the story at that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=105.28s)]
*  point. And so it's different how they approach these things when it's one of their guys on their [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=109.92s)]
*  team, both in terms of the mayor and the governor. And so I'm fine to say just don't politicize it at [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=116.72s)]
*  all. But I think the media, it's like the pot calling the kettle black when they're attacking [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=122.56s)]
*  Donald Trump, when they're the ones that are always the lead in these instances. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=126.88s)]
*  So, governor, I've made the request. I think Republican governors need to go out there and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=131.76s)]
*  show them how it's done because the people are crying out for help and they're American citizens [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=136.0s)]
*  and that's what we do. We pitch in. What are you doing right now to help them out? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=139.68s)]
*  Well, we immediately offered assistance. And so the Florida Division of Emergency Management [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=147.36s)]
*  is in contact with California's Emergency Management Agency. And as there's requests [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=152.96s)]
*  that come down the pike, we will fulfill those requests. And this is not something that's unusual [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=158.4s)]
*  amongst the states. We've provided support to California in the past when they've had [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=164.0s)]
*  wildfires. We've had states support us. I mean, when we had hurricanes, Hilleen and Milton, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=168.88s)]
*  we had a lot of people that sent assets down. Now, fortunately with Hilleen, we were able to send [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=174.16s)]
*  those back very quickly. And then we ended up sending our assets to Western North Carolina a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=178.8s)]
*  day or two after the hurricane. So states do have a very good track record in this country of working [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=183.52s)]
*  together. And it's not just Republican governors. I mean, Democrat governors have helped Florida. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=189.36s)]
*  We've helped Democrat governors. And I think this is something, those are Americans homes who've [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=193.6s)]
*  gone ablaze. They're from different political persuasions, but we have a responsibility as [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=198.72s)]
*  Americans to come together. Governor, I'm up against a heartbreak, but I got to ask you, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=203.76s)]
*  you're going to have a seat that you got to fill. Have you made a decision of who you're going to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=207.44s)]
*  fill that seat, Marco Rubio seat with? No, I haven't, but it will come soon and it's going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=211.28s)]
*  to be somebody that's going to help President Trump deliver on the mandate he earned from the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=217.92s)]
*  American people. It's going to be somebody that's going to be strong on immigration and it's going [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=222.24s)]
*  to be somebody that represents the conservative principles that have made this country great. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, governor, thank you so much. We appreciate it. More Fox News. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7CMYZm3IU&t=231.44s)]
