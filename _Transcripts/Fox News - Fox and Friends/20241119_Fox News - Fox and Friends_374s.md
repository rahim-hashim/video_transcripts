# Jillian Michaels: This is why Democrats got their butts kicked!
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o)
*  Meanwhile, a New York Times fact check fails completely, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=0.0s)]
*  falls completely flat over RFK Junior's claims [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  about what's really in a fan favorite breakfast cereal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=8.34s)]
*  It notes, quote, Kennedy has singled out fruit loops [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=12.08s)]
*  as an example of a product [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=15.5s)]
*  with too many artificial ingredients, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=17.0s)]
*  questioning why the Canadian version [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=19.66s)]
*  has fewer than the US version. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=21.38s)]
*  But he was wrong. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=23.28s)]
*  The ingredient list is roughly the same, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=24.22s)]
*  although Canada's has natural colorings [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=26.5s)]
*  made from blueberries and carrots, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=29.26s)]
*  while the US product contains red dye 40, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=30.96s)]
*  yellow five, and something known as BHT. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=34.34s)]
*  Here to react, celebrity fitness trainer, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=38.44s)]
*  Jillian Michaels. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  Jillian, good morning to you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=41.46s)]
*  Hey, good morning, how are you? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  I'm doing okay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=45.42s)]
*  But as it turns out, and Kennedy's spokesperson said, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=46.5s)]
*  what he was talking about is the differences in food dyes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=49.46s)]
*  The American version has food dyes and other stuff, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=53.46s)]
*  and the Canadian version, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=57.0s)]
*  they get the colors from these crazy things [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=59.12s)]
*  called blueberries and carrots. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=61.52s)]
*  That's wild, isn't it? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=65.08s)]
*  I know, it's exactly the same as what's in our food dyes, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=66.34s)]
*  which is coal tar and petroleum and crude oil. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=71.08s)]
*  I mean, the comparison is just unparalleled. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=75.16s)]
*  And in fact, if you Google side effects of blueberries, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=79.32s)]
*  you won't find neurotoxicity and cancer, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=82.56s)]
*  whereas you probably will, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=86.16s)]
*  should you do that with yellow five and blue this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=87.84s)]
*  and red that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=91.96s)]
*  It's just saying, but it's roughly the same. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, Jillian, given the fact that Donald Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  has nominated Bobby Kennedy Jr. now [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=98.8s)]
*  to be America's food advocate, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=101.96s)]
*  this has got to please you, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=104.16s)]
*  because you've been on our program talking about food [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=105.64s)]
*  and how we need to become a less obese nation, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=108.52s)]
*  and that's how you start, is with what we eat. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=112.22s)]
*  Exactly, I mean, personally, I'm overjoyed, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=115.92s)]
*  but I am very focused on getting him confirmed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=119.12s)]
*  through the Senate right now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=122.16s)]
*  So let's just say everybody in my space [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=123.8s)]
*  is hopefully optimistic, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=125.92s)]
*  and we're doing everything we can to make people aware [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=127.28s)]
*  of things like what you just brought up [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=130.36s)]
*  with the New York Times and the comparison [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=132.72s)]
*  between food in Europe and Canada [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=134.86s)]
*  with food and Europe here, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=136.68s)]
*  because it's easily understandable and quantifiable. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=138.48s)]
*  So thank you to the New York Times [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  for elevating this obvious disparity [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=143.3s)]
*  and helping to show that RFK is committed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  to fixing it for us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  Indeed, you know, there's another topic [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  we were just referring to, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=153.94s)]
*  a congressman up in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Seth Moulton, who is a Democrat. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=158.74s)]
*  He has received such backlash from his fellow Democrats [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  because he said, look, I got small daughters, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=165.38000000000002s)]
*  and I don't like the idea of them [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  playing against biologically born males. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=171.58s)]
*  A lot of blowback for him, but you know what? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=176.46s)]
*  He's standing tough. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=179.18s)]
*  Listen to this just a moment ago. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=180.34s)]
*  You have a strong record of supporting trans people, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=182.94s)]
*  including trans kids, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=185.86s)]
*  and this isn't about trans kids either. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  That's another criticism I hear. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=188.9s)]
*  Look, my kids are young. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=191.9s)]
*  They play on coed soccer teams, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=192.94s)]
*  just like I did when I was their age too. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  But when they get older, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=197.46s)]
*  when we're talking about competitive sports, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=198.86s)]
*  when people are a lot bigger, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  it's reasonable to have restrictions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=203.62s)]
*  For some reason, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=205.42s)]
*  because of some orthodox litmus test in our party, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=206.26s)]
*  we're not even supposed to entertain the idea. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=209.86s)]
*  And I'm just saying, let's have a debate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=212.3s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=214.78s)]
*  But for a lot of people, there is no debate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=216.06s)]
*  I think he hit the nail on the head, Jillian. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=217.9s)]
*  He said, it's reasonable to have restrictions. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=219.82s)]
*  Without question, all of the scientific research [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=225.34s)]
*  shows that there is a vast biological difference [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=230.02s)]
*  between men and women. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=234.02s)]
*  So let's table that for a second. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=235.02s)]
*  Here's what I'd like to say. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=237.22s)]
*  It's no question that people who are transgender [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  should live free of bigotry, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=241.78s)]
*  but their rights don't supersede the rights [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=244.3s)]
*  of all of the other women [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=247.06s)]
*  who are training their entire lives to get on to the podium. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=248.94s)]
*  That is without question. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=252.9s)]
*  And I wanna say to Seth, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=254.94s)]
*  this is why your entire party [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=256.74s)]
*  got their butts kicked in the election. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=258.94s)]
*  So buddy, take a stand and dig in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=261.94s)]
*  because this is your moment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=264.54s)]
*  Really, honestly, wake up your team [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=266.6s)]
*  because you are going to lose not just this one, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=269.74s)]
*  but all of the others in the future [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  if you don't turn this around for yourself. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  People are sick of it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=277.1s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=278.62s)]
*  But you know, Jillian, across the board, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=280.1s)]
*  when you look at how the Democrats ran [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=281.82s)]
*  this particular presidential election, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  there wasn't a lot of common sense. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=286.86s)]
*  It was just kind of like, okay, we're for this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=288.82s)]
*  and you gotta be for us too. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=290.86s)]
*  Right, and then they shamed people [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  who dared to raise up a flag of concern. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=296.46s)]
*  You know, you had Barack Obama out there [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=301.26s)]
*  telling men of color that if they didn't vote for her, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=303.94s)]
*  they were race traders. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=306.38s)]
*  And then you had Michelle Obama telling men [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  that if they didn't vote for her, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=309.78s)]
*  they were misogynist and sexist. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, maybe they just didn't want their daughter [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=313.58s)]
*  playing against biological males. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=317.02s)]
*  Maybe that was their concern. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=318.76s)]
*  I cannot wrap my head around the party [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=321.29999999999995s)]
*  that the Democrats have become. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwFWc-7W7o&t=324.17999999999995s)]
