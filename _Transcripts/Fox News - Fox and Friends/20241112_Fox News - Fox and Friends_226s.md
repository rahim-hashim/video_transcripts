# Trump transition attorney issues warning to 'career' DOJ employees
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E)
*  Government employees are reportedly claiming they have PTSD from Trump's first term, calling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=0.0s)]
*  his re-election a dystopian hellscape and are dreading his return. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  You don't have to stay. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=9.32s)]
*  But our next guest, working on the Trump administration transition team, has a strong warning for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=10.42s)]
*  those resisting the new agenda. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=14.44s)]
*  Attorney Mark Paoletta served in the very first Trump administration and joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=16.52s)]
*  Mark, your response to some of the PTSD claims. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=23.48s)]
*  You know, Brian, who would have thought it's controversial that when a new boss comes in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=28.36s)]
*  with a new agenda, that the people who work there are going to support the president's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=32.88s)]
*  agenda, right? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Only in the federal government, only with a deep swamp, do people, you know, career [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=37.72s)]
*  employees think that they get to run the joint as it were. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=41.68s)]
*  You know, President Trump, you know, was re-elected with an overwhelming majority of an agenda [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=46.0s)]
*  by the American people, popularly supported. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=51.74s)]
*  So deporting millions of illegal aliens out of this country, securing the border, banning [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=54.12s)]
*  DEI, all that destructive stuff that the Biden administration let run wild, getting boys [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=60.76s)]
*  out of girls sports. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=66.36s)]
*  Those are all the things that the Department of Justice is going to work on. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  And those are the things that the Department of Justice employees, career employees, are [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=70.88s)]
*  going to support. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  And if they don't want to support it, they should leave. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=76.74s)]
*  Mark, the other thing is, and we'll get into it another time, if you have an efficiency [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=78.92s)]
*  guy named Elon Musk, there's a lot of these agencies and these bureaucracies are just [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=83.08s)]
*  fat, with people who feel they are not accountable just checking the clock, wondering, you know, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  when they can retire. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=93.92s)]
*  And I think they're in danger of being gutted, even though they are unionized. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=95.32s)]
*  I want to talk about what's going to be facing Donald Trump today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  We're going to find out if Judge Juan Merson is going to make a decision on whether he's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=101.64s)]
*  going to go through with sentencing with Trump in relation to the Supreme Court ruling that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=105.96s)]
*  said his act that's under scrutiny, that he was convicted of, was actually he's now [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=111.4s)]
*  immune from. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=116.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is again, this is what was on the ballot. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=118.5s)]
*  The American people reject this lawfare that was engaged in by the left by Judge Merson [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=123.72s)]
*  to go after President Trump, to target him as a political opponent. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=130.12s)]
*  So yes, I think he should dismiss it today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=133.44s)]
*  had to step in and make a ruling that every American, every legal person understood that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=136.84s)]
*  the president is immune. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  The president did nothing wrong, that the left drummed up these, invented these crimes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=144.4s)]
*  And so hopefully it's put to bed today. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=150.0s)]
*  I know, you hope, but we've seen Juan Merson just love the spotlight in my view. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=152.52s)]
*  I mean, he was taking a photo shoot before the court case started. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=157.32s)]
*  You see these pictures are professionally done. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=161.0s)]
*  So knowing that he loves the spotlight like he does, do you think he would do what you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=163.34s)]
*  say is the right thing and just put an end to this today? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=167.3s)]
*  Or do you think that he, to characterize his behavior, he's going to look to extend this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=170.94s)]
*  and get us to a sentencing day? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=175.5s)]
*  Yeah, I hope he dismisses it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=177.46s)]
*  It's the right, it's the right, it has to happen under the Supreme Court's ruling in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=179.3s)]
*  terms of he introduced into evidence information that was, you know, protected under presidential [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=184.1s)]
*  immunity. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=190.06s)]
*  Legally, the entire case is infected and flawed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=191.78s)]
*  So yes, I hope he dismisses it, doesn't go forward. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=196.78s)]
*  If you can read the writing on the wall, the American people rejected this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=201.58s)]
*  President Trump's going to be coming into office in a few weeks. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  And all of this needs to end today. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=209.46s)]
*  And we'll find out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=212.66s)]
*  It's in his jurisdiction. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=213.66s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMrvquYJe-E&t=214.66s)]
