# Elon Musk tours Israeli border town during wartime visit
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4)
*  We begin the seven o'clock hour Fox and friends with a Fox News alert. We are now in the fourth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=0.0s)]
*  and final day of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. And we're learning that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=7.8s)]
*  both sides have concerns over the list of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=14.64s)]
*  due to be released. 14 more Israeli hostages were freed yesterday, bringing the total number [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=19.16s)]
*  now to 40 over the last three days. Meanwhile, Trey Yankst is live at Schneider Children's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=24.98s)]
*  Medical Center in Israel, where it is two o'clock in the afternoon. Trey. Yeah. Hey guys. Good [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=31.82s)]
*  morning. For the third straight evening last night, a group of hostages was released by Hamas [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=38.06s)]
*  as part of this broader ceasefire deal. We're talking about 14 Israeli nationals and three [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=43.34s)]
*  Thai citizens. Nine children and two mothers were flown by helicopter to this hospital just [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=48.5s)]
*  outside of Tel Aviv, where they are receiving treatment at this hour. Among that group, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=54.7s)]
*  four year old Abigail Idan, an American Israeli citizen, so often she was spoken about as [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  a symbol of hope here in Israel and across the United States. Yesterday, President Biden [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=65.94s)]
*  speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about her case. Both leaders just [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=70.78s)]
*  excited that she was out of Gaza and on that list yesterday. Now, today we've been speaking [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=75.62s)]
*  with family members of the Children at Schneider Children's Hospital about what this experience [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=80.58s)]
*  has been like for them reuniting with their loved ones. Take a listen to this grandmother [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=85.82s)]
*  who describes what it was like to see her grandchildren after more than 50 days. We [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=89.9s)]
*  had them a lot again and again and again. We cry a lot. We laugh a lot. It was like [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=95.5s)]
*  a circle that's like a wave like a storm. You know, all the feelings flow up. It was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=105.78s)]
*  amazing. As the Israeli government works diplomatic channels to get more hostages out, we know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=122.06s)]
*  that Israeli leadership is trying to show the world more about what happened in these [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=129.9s)]
*  small communities on October 7th. Today, Elon Musk visiting Israel alongside Israeli Prime [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=133.74s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair toured the small kibbutz of Kafar Aza along the Gaza [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=139.26000000000002s)]
*  border to see the aftermath of that massacre. Guys, Trey. So today is the last day of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=144.62s)]
*  four day ceasefire, the original deal. And I was just looking at the times of Israel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=152.74s)]
*  and it sounds like both sides are willing to talk about extending it. But the devil [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=157.94s)]
*  is in the details. Yeah, absolutely. We've been talking with regional intelligence sources [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=165.06s)]
*  and also people directly involved in the negotiations. We know the Qataris and the Egyptians are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=171.46s)]
*  working overtime today to try and get this deal expanded. The initial agreement says [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=176.38s)]
*  that 10 hostages would have to be released for every additional day that sees a pause [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=181.66s)]
*  in fighting. I do want you to listen to this government spokesperson who described what [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=186.18s)]
*  the next phase of this conflict will look like. And we want to see the second stage [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  of that agreement go into place to the extent that Hamas is interested to release more hostages. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=196.82s)]
*  I've seen the reports that Hamas says that it can't locate all of them. That is, of course, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=202.62s)]
*  horrific, beyond measure and beyond comment. And we expect if Hamas is interested in extending [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  that hostage release pause in exchange for an additional pause in the fighting to get [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=213.26s)]
*  the list of the names it is wanting to release. The Israelis are going to do everything possible [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=217.88s)]
*  to use these diplomatic channels and get hostages out of Gaza. But we have a firm understanding [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=224.84s)]
*  from the leadership that we've talked to and also members of the military who say that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=230.04s)]
*  once this ceasefire is over, they will resume all ground and air campaigns against Gaza. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  Trey, you're at the Schneider Children's Hospital. That's where we saw that young boy who's nine [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=240.92s)]
*  years old run down the hallway into his father's arms. Hasn't seen him since this began on [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=244.16s)]
*  October 7th. I was reading one article that said they believe 11 will be released today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=249.12s)]
*  Is that correct information? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=254.72s)]
*  Yeah, we're being really careful with the list because they've been changing so much. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=256.32s)]
*  Hamas is using this as an opportunity to try and put psychological pressure on Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=262.36s)]
*  They are very delicate negotiations, but when they are released, the children will likely [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=268.24s)]
*  be flown here again to Schneider's Hospital outside of Tel Aviv. You mentioned nine-year-old [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Ohad. He celebrated his birthday, his ninth birthday, inside Gaza. But once he arrived [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  here, he was reunited with his father, and he just wanted to eat mashed potatoes and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=282.8s)]
*  chicken. We've heard that from a lot of the families. These are just kids. They're being [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=286.8s)]
*  kids. That grandmother that we spoke with, she said, my grandchildren wanted pizza, and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=290.64s)]
*  they wanted iPads so that they could play games. And I think that really cuts through [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=295.12s)]
*  this horrific, horrific story. These are kids that were held for more than 50 days by Hamas [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=298.88s)]
*  inside Gaza, and finally, some of them are coming home. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=303.48s)]
*  And the thing is, Trey, and some of them get home, but there is no home. The whole town's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=306.4s)]
*  been wiped out, and others, they have no parents, like Abigail. Both parents slaughtered in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=310.8s)]
*  front of her. So, man, it's great to be free, but life has changed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=316.76s)]
*  Absolutely. You think about four-year-old Abigail. Both of her parents were murdered [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  on October 7th. And even that grandmother that we spoke with, her son was killed, and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  one of her granddaughters was killed. And so, while she was reunited with her other [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=333.6s)]
*  grandchildren today, this is still an incredibly, incredibly painful experience. Anyone who's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  ever lost a loved one, you know that feeling, the emptiness in your heart. And so many people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  across Israel are experiencing that still today. And so it's a mixture of emotions [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=348.16s)]
*  here at the hospital, reunited with loved ones, but also remembering that not every [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=353.08s)]
*  family member can show up because some of them are no longer here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=356.76s)]
*  You know, Trey, I want to talk about the fairness of the deal. You know, the Qataris, the foreign [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=360.0s)]
*  minister said that Israel was solely responsible for the escalation. They're a safe haven for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=365.36s)]
*  religious terrorists as well in their country. So I wonder, is Israel getting a fair deal [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=374.36s)]
*  or has there been some criticism of that? I mean, they're like a sanctuary city for [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  terrorism. Two of the Hamas leaders lived there. They give them millions of dollars [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  a year. Do the people of Israel feel like they're getting a fair deal? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  They don't. And we should look at this deal and who's being released, right? It's a three [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=397.12s)]
*  to one ratio. So for every hostage that is released, the Palestinians will receive three [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  prisoners that are being held in Israeli prisons. And it's a mixture of people. Some of them [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  were in administrative detention that were going to be detained for around a year. Others [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=410.2s)]
*  were attempted car bombers, people who carried out stabbing and shooting attacks. And yesterday, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=414.88s)]
*  I think really highlighted the exchange. You had these children that are being held here [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=420.8s)]
*  looking to eat pizza. They were exchanged for a woman who tried to set off a car bomb [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=425.4s)]
*  in Israel years ago and was facing more years in her sentence. And that was the exchange [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=430.88s)]
*  for three Palestinian prisoners to one hostage. And so there is frustration among the Israeli [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=437.04s)]
*  people. Everyone that you talk to here, they say this is not a fair deal, but they're willing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=441.36s)]
*  to do it because they want to get as many of those hostages out as possible, understanding [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=445.48s)]
*  that this war is not over. This is a pause in the fighting. The conflict really is just [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=449.48s)]
*  beginning when you look at the timeline of what the Israelis have laid out. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=453.8s)]
*  All right, Trey, thank you very much. Live report from the Children's Hospital there [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  in Israel. We're learning more about the people on the big screen who have been released. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=460.8s)]
*  Also, we heard a story this morning about how somebody who's got dual Israeli-Russian [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=466.88s)]
*  citizenship fell by the name of Ron Crivio. He was kidnapped from that rave. He's not [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=473.88s)]
*  on this big screen. He's still being held. His aunt told Israeli Public Radio that he [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=479.88s)]
*  was in a building that was shelled and then collapsed, and he tried to escape, and he [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=487.76s)]
*  did escape. And he was on the loose for four days. And then he was recaptured and hauled [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=492.36s)]
*  back into his lair somewhere. That little girl, Abigail, that Brian was [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=499.6s)]
*  talking about, the four-year-old. She's on the bottom, right in the middle of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=505.52s)]
*  the screen. That's right. That's right. There she is. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=508.08s)]
*  Abigail Edon, she's four. She turned four when she was in captivity. She does have two [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=510.64s)]
*  siblings, a six-year-old and a ten-year-old. They locked themselves in the closet for 14 [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=515.4s)]
*  hours while their mom and dad were shot in front of little Abigail. Abigail's dad shielded [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=519.8s)]
*  her with his body. She crawled out from underneath him, went next door to another little girl's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=524.8s)]
*  house that she goes to preschool with. And that's when they were captured, and she was [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=529.68s)]
*  captured. Thankfully, she's back with her family. She's an American and Israeli citizen, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=535.0s)]
*  has both citizenships. She's going to live with her aunt and her uncle and her grandparents, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  who are her siblings, are now. Right. They think it's equal change. You took a four-year-old, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=544.68s)]
*  you took an 85-year-old, and you're getting back people who are convicted criminals. So [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=549.64s)]
*  does anyone think this is equal? Out there, those people shutting down Manhattan Bridge [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=554.68s)]
*  yesterday, do they think that was equal? The one chanting KKK in front of the Museum of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=559.0s)]
*  Natural History, do they think this is equal? You think that girl deserved to be captured [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=564.04s)]
*  as opposed to a 19-year-old who tried to kill Israelis? It's absolutely insane. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=568.52s)]
*  There is no comparison between the hostages and the people that committed terrorist acts. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=573.32s)]
*  And I'll say this, I know that we have a base in Qatar, but they've known not to be honest [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=580.12s)]
*  brokers. I mean, this is the same people that gave Khalid Sheikh Mohammed a tip that we were [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=585.64s)]
*  going after him, after 9-11, one of the guys that were the mastermind above it. So these [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=592.92s)]
*  aren't people that we can necessarily trust. Well, and they're the ones who are negotiating. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=597.4s)]
*  The Qataris and the Egyptians who are making this possible. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSlRun3Nd4&t=601.72s)]
