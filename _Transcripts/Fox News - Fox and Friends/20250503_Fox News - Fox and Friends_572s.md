# Kristi Noem: Dems hit ‘new low’ backing Abrego Garcia
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY)
*  Three Virginia correction officers are in the hospital after what officials say was a coordinated stabbing by inmates connected to MS-13. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes as Democrats try to distance themselves from deported MS-13 suspect Kilmar Abrego Garcia after new audio from his wife detailing domestic violence allegations surfaces. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=9.0s)]
*  We're not vouching for Kilmar Abrego Garcia. We are vouching for his constitutional rights. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=23.0s)]
*  I think our advocacy here has a little bit less to do with him individually and more the process. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=32.0s)]
*  The process and the fact the lack of due process that this administration continues to act with. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=41.0s)]
*  So let's bring in Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Mrs. Madam Secretary. So great to see you. Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=51.0s)]
*  It's really kind of amazing when you step back and you look at, you know, there was a time when this was like an actual controversial issue. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=59.0s)]
*  I think it's now turned into like an 80 20 issue. But the idea that Democrats are now going out of their way to die on a hill defending a guy like this Garcia character, it's kind of mind blowing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. The mainstream media, these congressmen, these senators, the Democrat Party wrapping their arms around a known human smuggler, a wife beater, a violent criminal that was finally held accountable for his actions. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=87.0s)]
*  The fact that they went to the mat for this guy just shows exactly who they are, that they are people who don't put America first. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=102.0s)]
*  They don't care about our citizens and protecting our communities. So I'm glad that the onions been peeled back and that their true motivations are have been revealed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=110.0s)]
*  And this is just one of the cases that we're getting off the streets. You know, since President Trump has been in office, we have removed thousands and thousands of violent criminals and people are safer today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=119.0s)]
*  So so obviously, Democrats have come a long way from the time when they lectured all of us about believing all women, they seem to not be so interested in his wife's testimony. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=129.0s)]
*  You know, her statements about what he did to her. Oh, yeah, absolutely. And repeatedly and over and over again. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=141.0s)]
*  And the other people who witnessed it to those other people who witnessed these beatings and these abuses, too. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=149.0s)]
*  And you listen to the emotion in her voice and the trauma. And then they backed up this guy and they fought for him and they flew to El Salvador to stand with him and say, this is the kind of guy I want to be friends with and advocate for and throw our federal laws and throw the United States of America under the bus for. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=154.0s)]
*  Boy, I tell you what, this is this is a new low for Senator Van Hollen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=169.0s)]
*  But for the Democratic Party and for the mainstream media that they perpetuated this, they started all of this and gave it a platform to gain momentum. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=174.0s)]
*  For those who haven't heard that, I think it's important for people to listen, because it's it's poignant. Listen. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=183.0s)]
*  He grabbed me from my hair and then he slapped me and then the neighbor like he didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to react. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=191.0s)]
*  I have pictures of the evidence, like all the bruises, because even on Wednesday, he hit me like around like three in the morning. He would just wake up and like hit me. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=196.0s)]
*  You know, Christian, my husband was a prosecutor at one time and he would have women who were beat up by their husbands, who would give statements like this and then go into court and and defend, you know, end up defending the person who beat them up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=207.0s)]
*  Feels like that's where the Democrats are at right now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And that's what I'm concerned about. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=225.0s)]
*  I think the thing today is, is she still scared? So many people and victims I've worked with over the years, you know, they say one thing in public because they have to to survive or to protect their children. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=228.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't say that, you know, what she's saying today is how she really feels. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=238.0s)]
*  I think she could be in fear as well. And and that's what happens. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=243.0s)]
*  That's why one of the reasons that we opened the Voices office again over here in Homeland Security, the Voices office was established under the first Trump administration to be an advocate and a resource for people who were victims of AIDS. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=246.0s)]
*  And it was a very, very important piece of information that was used to cover up the illegal alien crime, illegal aliens. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=258.0s)]
*  And you know what? Biden closed it down. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=265.0s)]
*  I think Elon talked last night on this network about coverups. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=267.0s)]
*  This was one of the biggest coverups of illegal immigrant crime because Biden shut down this office so that these victims had nowhere to go to get help. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=271.0s)]
*  It couldn't be documented. It couldn't be tracked. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=280.0s)]
*  And so we opened it again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=282.0s)]
*  We reopened it again so that people like the angel moms and other victims have a resource to track where these court hearings are, when these illegals are in the country, when they're going to be released and how they're held accountable. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=283.0s)]
*  So you talk about coverups that Joe Biden facilitated this one endangered Americans and we're so thankful President Trump is back and taking care of the victims of these terrible crimes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=295.0s)]
*  So we're going to cover up Secretary. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=305.0s)]
*  So we've been following very closely here on Fox and Fox. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=308.0s)]
*  But he says the 300000 children that went missing under under Joe Biden's watch. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=313.0s)]
*  You remember all the people crying about kids in cages who also voted against getting DNA tests for these children to find out who are the adults who claim to be their aunts or uncles or parents? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=319.0s)]
*  This past week in one of the cabinet meetings, our case said this and I thought it was one of the most remarkable moments of that cabinet meeting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=331.0s)]
*  Listen, we have ended HHS as the role as the factor, the principal vector in this country for child trafficking. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=338.0s)]
*  And during the Biden administration, HHS became a collaborator in child trafficking and for sex and for for slavery. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=349.0s)]
*  And we have ended that and we're very aggressively going out and trying to find these children, 300000 children that were lost by the Biden administration. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=361.0s)]
*  So our government was complicit in child labor, child sex trafficking. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=370.0s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. They knew what was happening here and they did it anyway. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=375.0s)]
*  The secretary of HHS now saying I've I've shut this down. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=380.0s)]
*  But what is Homeland Security or any other parts of the government doing to find these children who Donald Trump told me in bed minister last summer? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=385.0s)]
*  He promised to do everything he could to locate them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=392.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, Bobby's absolutely right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=397.0s)]
*  He's correct. They were facilitating putting children in unsafe homes and people who were trafficking them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=400.0s)]
*  The Biden administration went out there and didn't even vet these sponsors many times. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=405.0s)]
*  And many, many children would go through a sponsor's home and it could be someone who was using them to profit off of them, victimizing them over and over again. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=410.0s)]
*  So the fact that he stopped that is absolutely wonderful. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=418.0s)]
*  And we have in Homeland Security and with their partnership as well, reunited over 5000 children already with their appropriate family members [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=421.0s)]
*  and people who love them and will care for them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=429.0s)]
*  We're going to continue to work on that and continue to bring these children back home and then get them healing from what they've been through and the trauma that they've had. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=431.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party facilitated and funded separating children from their families and victimizing them and trafficking them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=439.0s)]
*  And that has stopped under President Trump. And we're so grateful for his leadership. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=448.0s)]
*  So incredible. Yes, indeed. Secretary Noem, real quick, I want to get your thoughts on real ID deadline approaching this week. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=451.0s)]
*  This week on the 7th. What's your information, your pitch to the viewers out there? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=458.0s)]
*  There are some who are concerned about this. What do you want them to know? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=463.0s)]
*  Well, I want them to know it's a law that was passed 20 years ago that the Biden administration never implemented. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=468.0s)]
*  And the May 7th is the date that was set by Congress. It has to be implemented by 81 percent of travelers are already compliant with real ID. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=475.0s)]
*  And what they need to do is look at their license and see if it has a little star in the right hand corner. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=483.0s)]
*  If it does, they have a real ID compliant passport or bring a passport if you don't have that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=488.0s)]
*  But if you don't have a real ID, then you may need to go through additional vetting or put in a different line, get a warning. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=495.0s)]
*  Just because we know that this is federal law and it allows us to know who's on our federally regulated aircrafts. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=504.0s)]
*  And it's a safety concern. And also for me, there's 19 states right now that issue drivers licenses to illegal aliens. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=511.0s)]
*  If we make sure that they're real ID compliant, it helps us get to election integrity as well. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=518.0s)]
*  If we know that citizens and people that are here with legal status are the ones getting drivers licenses and using those IDs, oftentimes those are the same IDs that they have to use when they show up to vote as well. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=524.0s)]
*  So it's a safety law that was put in place many years ago. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=536.0s)]
*  We want everybody to be aware that when they get to the airport to have that real ID ready to go. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=540.0s)]
*  But the good thing is, is 81 percent of Americans already have one. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=545.0s)]
*  So we don't expect there to be inconveniences or waits at all. We're prepared for May 7th to get here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=549.0s)]
*  Look for the stars. Secretary Noem, thank you so, so much for spending time with us here this morning. Have a great weekend. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=555.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-VFayvUcTY&t=566.0s)]
