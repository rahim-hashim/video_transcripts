# LIFE IS A HIGHWAY: 19-year-old skips college for truck driving
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY)
*  The cost of a four-year degree only continues to rise, with the average four-year college degree costing over $307,000. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=0.0s)]
*  Our next guest opted out of that pricey path, instead pursuing a career as a truck driver for New York's transportation department. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=10.5s)]
*  Bree Loomis joins us now. Bree, it's so great to have you on this morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=19.88s)]
*  So tell me why you made this decision to go to tech school and become a truck driver. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=25.18s)]
*  So yeah, I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do. I bounced back and forth between a lot of things. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  At one point I wanted to be a veterinarian and a school teacher and then a welder. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=36.62s)]
*  And I couldn't just commit to paying, you know, over $300,000 just to go to school and think, well, maybe this is what I want to do, but then decide I didn't. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=40.42s)]
*  So we had this awesome two-year program through my school and it was a conservation program. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=48.92s)]
*  We learned how to operate equipment, fish and wildlife, tree identification, you name it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=54.660000000000004s)]
*  Like we were outside and we learned it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=58.86s)]
*  And there were so many different career possibilities through that and just like career exposure. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=61.06s)]
*  So I figured if I went there, I could find something that I wanted to do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  And I wasn't paying so much money to just see what was out there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=69.62s)]
*  And then I fell in love with operating equipment and driving truck and I got my CDL and here I am. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=74.56s)]
*  So how much did it cost to go to tech school? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=79.92s)]
*  Can you give us a range so people listening might know? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=81.89999999999999s)]
*  So my school kind of sponsored it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  They paid, like the district paid for us to go. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  And then getting my CDL, the program was around $4,000. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Wow, that's amazing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  What did your parents think? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  Because I've talked to people in these industries and they said oftentimes the parents are the obstacle. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=98.4s)]
*  They're the ones with the college dreams. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=103.4s)]
*  Yeah, so my dad is super supportive. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=106.9s)]
*  My mom was a little hesitant at first just because she wanted to see me succeed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=110.14s)]
*  But after I convinced her that I could do it, she just gave right in and she's been there ever since. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=113.14s)]
*  I noticed in the research about you that your motto in life is if your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=119.14s)]
*  I actually have that up in my house. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=126.14000000000001s)]
*  I say it to my kids all the time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  Has anything scared you about making this decision? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  Was there any kind of fear? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, every step of the way I was kind of scared. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=136.88s)]
*  Getting my CDL was probably the scariest. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=139.88s)]
*  In my class there was one other girl. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=142.88s)]
*  So it was basically the two of us against the world and we conquered it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=144.88s)]
*  And then I work with primarily all men. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=148.88s)]
*  So you never know what they're going to think or what they're going to say. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=151.88s)]
*  But I end up working with some of the best guys and they're all super supportive. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=154.88s)]
*  Well, you sound like a girl with a great attitude. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=158.88s)]
*  And this choice is a choice a lot of people are making, especially in these tough times. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=162.62s)]
*  So thanks for sharing your story and shedding a little light on what that might look like for people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=166.62s)]
*  And hopefully those who are interested will look into it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=171.62s)]
*  Thanks for joining us, Rhee. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=174.62s)]
*  So interesting talking to you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=175.62s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=177.62s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OtlFohj1FY&t=179.62s)]
