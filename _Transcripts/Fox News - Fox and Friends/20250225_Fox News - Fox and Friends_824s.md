# Musk says fed workers will get another chance to report productivity or be terminated
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I)
*  great Elon Musk is giving some federal workers the boot and others a second chance to respond [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=0.0s)]
*  to his email. Yeah, I just had that as he continues asking for details of what they [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=8.24s)]
*  accomplished over the last week. Madeline Rivera joins us live from Washington with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  the latest. Good morning, Maddie. Hi guys. Good morning. Yeah, there's a lot of confusion [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=17.72s)]
*  regarding this directive. Elon Musk says while there is a second chance to respond, failure [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=22.64s)]
*  to answer again will result in termination this time, but the Office of Personnel Management [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=27.42s)]
*  says agencies will be the ones to review responses and evaluate non responses. They look into [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=32.620000000000005s)]
*  whether employees were on excused leave yesterday or whether they had access to their email [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=38.58s)]
*  over the weekend. The OPM also says agency heads can exclude some workers from this expectation [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=43.38s)]
*  at their discretion, given that they provide reasons for exclusions. And finally, the OPM [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=49.18000000000001s)]
*  says it is up to the agency's leadership to determine what actions are taken. Some agencies [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=54.58s)]
*  like the FBI and the Department of Defense, for instance, have told employees not to respond [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=59.86s)]
*  to the OPM email saying they'll be doing their own reviews. But others like the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=64.06s)]
*  Transportation Secretary saying that their department is going to be following this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=68.62s)]
*  directive from Musk. But President Trump says the different orders don't necessarily mean [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=73.62s)]
*  a division between the Trump administration and Musk, and he's defending Musk's order. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=82.1s)]
*  So what they're doing is they're trying to find out who's working for the government. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=82.52s)]
*  Are we paying other people that aren't working? And you know, where's all this? Where's the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=86.96s)]
*  money gone? There was a lot of genius in sending it. We're trying to find out if people are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  working. And so we're sending a letter to people, please tell us what you did last week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=96.28s)]
*  If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=101.24s)]
*  working. There appears to be no deadline set for a second response. We'll see if we get [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=105.84s)]
*  more clarity later today. Lawrence, Steve Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=111.84s)]
*  See, that last word, clarity. Yeah. There hasn't been a lot of that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=114.92s)]
*  Madeline, so for the federal employees who are watching right now, what are they supposed to do? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, we'll see. We'll see later on today if we get more answers from the White House, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=125.76s)]
*  from the president. Look, if you listen to the OPM email, what they'll say is that there is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=131.04s)]
*  not taking a one size fits all approach to this. The administration says they'll take into [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=137.88s)]
*  account the differences among the different agencies. They'll work with the different [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=142.6s)]
*  agencies. And they're taking into things like confidentiality reasons, for example, which [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=145.88s)]
*  President Trump says was the reason, for example, that the FBI and the DOD, why they might [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  not be responding to this email right now. So they'll take those factors into account. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=155.56s)]
*  The White House is downplaying the notion that there is a division between the OPM and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  they say at the end of the day, the administration is working together to create more efficiency [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  among federal workers. But again, like you said, Steve, there is no doubt that there are a lot of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=170.28s)]
*  federal workers who are confused by this and they are hoping to get more answers later on today. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  All right, Madeline. Thank you very much. Well, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=179.88s)]
*  Elon posted, he said the email request was utterly trivial as the standard for passing the test was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=181.64s)]
*  to type some words and press send. Yet so many failed, even that inane test urged on in some [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=187.16s)]
*  cases by their managers. Have you ever witnessed such incompetence and contempt for how your taxes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=192.92s)]
*  are being spent? Makes old Twitter look good? Didn't think that was possible. The problem is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=197.72s)]
*  the federal workers are getting these mixed messages and it seems to be a turf war by some [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  of the agency leaders, the new agency leaders and Elon Musk. Now, Donald Trump said yesterday, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=205.88s)]
*  look, all we're trying to do is make sure these people are actually working, that there are actual [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  people like the Social Security sending out checks to people that are 140 years old. Well, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=215.48s)]
*  that doesn't exist. So they're just making sure that these positions are filled by live bodies. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=220.12s)]
*  And so we're not sending money to people, paychecks to people who don't exist. But the problem is you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=225.72s)]
*  have Office of Personnel Management, they're saying it's voluntary. You won't be fired if you [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=231.0s)]
*  don't respond. You have Cash Patel with the FBI saying pause responses. We're in charge of employee [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=234.36s)]
*  reviews. And then you have Kristi Noem with Department of Homeland Security saying don't respond. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=238.76s)]
*  So what are you supposed to do? Right, exactly. So who's running the show? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=243.16s)]
*  Well, the president gave them some cover yesterday as well. Remember, a lot of these same agencies, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=247.08s)]
*  whether you're talking about the Defense Department as well as transportation as well, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  have invited Doge into their department. So they're not anti-Doge. What they're saying is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  the information that's going out, there's some security measures that need to put in place [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  for that. So they want to coordinate the response of this. So there's a lot of people who are going [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=265.88s)]
*  to be let go in a lot of different agencies. I know the transportation has let some people go [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=271.88s)]
*  now. The VA, Doug Collins, has dismissed more than 1,400 employees with non-mission critical [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=276.84s)]
*  positions. Others in transportation were let go, did not have safety implications day to day. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=283.64s)]
*  And that's what's happening too. Just about everywhere, if you're a probationary, they're [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=290.76s)]
*  looking to let you go. And I think the overarching headline is we have to cut the federal workload. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  It's 2.7 million. It's got to get less. The question is now, that was a speech the president [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=300.52s)]
*  gave at CPAC. The president, Elon Musk, saw it and said, I hear you, Mr. President. I put [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=306.52s)]
*  him with this email. And the president said, yesterday, I'd like the idea of an email. But [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=310.84s)]
*  I just think next time, very easy. A lot of these people are Elon Musk's personal friends. Hey, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to send out an email. And it's going to go to all the divisions. Are you okay with this? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=320.12s)]
*  Because Cash Patel was only on the job two days. He can't have FBI agents who may be miscommunicated [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=324.2s)]
*  being excess. Same with Tulsi Gavrich. He's like, I really can't do this. So I'm going to back out. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=330.28s)]
*  It doesn't mean they're fighting. It just means they can just make a little bit more of an effort [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=335.96s)]
*  to coordinate. And that's the key. I think a lot of it's the State Department and the FBI and the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  National Security Apparatus is they don't want their boss, they don't want somebody at a laptop [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=344.28s)]
*  somewhere putting out, okay, these are the five classified things I did last week. Because there [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  was an email that went out yesterday from HSS, Health and Human Services, an email to the staff [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=354.52s)]
*  and said, if you reply, assume that what you write will be read by maligned foreign actors, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=361.96s)]
*  so tailor your responses accordingly. What's curious, though, I don't know if you guys saw [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=368.12s)]
*  this or not, but there was a there was hearing yesterday regarding Doge access to Treasury [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=373.23999999999995s)]
*  records. And the government attorney representing the White House was asked by the judge, so who [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=380.2s)]
*  exactly is running Doge? Who is the administrator? And the attorney for the federal government said, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=386.6s)]
*  I don't exactly know. I don't have that answer. So it's kind of like, what is the flow chart for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  the person who's running Doge? Elon Musk has been described as an advisor to the president. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=399.16s)]
*  Well, I think it's a flat organization. This is not an organization. And I think Washington is so [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=405.32000000000005s)]
*  used to this org chart with this person. Essentially, you have all these people [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  that are across agencies reporting back to Elon Musk, who then goes back to the president, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=416.67999999999995s)]
*  and he makes the final decision on it. I just want them to be able to do their job. It looks [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=421.96s)]
*  like they're doing a great job. There's some bumps in a row. The last thing I would say this, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=426.52s)]
*  because I've been getting a lot of emails from federal employees. I understand why some of you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=429.64s)]
*  guys are feeling the heat and you've been lumped into the basket of all the other federal employees [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=434.67999999999995s)]
*  that Americans have distrust for. We're not talking about you. We understand that there are [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=440.44s)]
*  career people that just want to do their job, that love their country. But you have to understand, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=445.08s)]
*  it is a bipartisan thing. When you look at the latest polling, independents, Democrats, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=450.68s)]
*  as well as Republicans, all feel like there's some inefficiency in our government. And I apologize [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=455.08s)]
*  that you guys are being lumped in. You want to do your job. But something has to give here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=461.32s)]
*  Just like in the broadest. Argentina's doing it. And that's what they did. They had 110% inflation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=465.56s)]
*  It was a joke. So this guy came in. That's the leader who gave him the chainsaw. So he's trying [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=471.96s)]
*  to do the same thing. And I just think the more you realize, Musk's agency is the only way to do [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=477.0s)]
*  it. Because if you do it through normal committee meetings and oversight, it ends up being a report [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=482.92s)]
*  that nobody does. Remember the Erskine Bowles report? They looked at government's inefficiency [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=487.8s)]
*  for 18 months. The Simpson Bowles. And they looked at it. It was pretty comprehensive. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=496.68s)]
*  Barack Obama looked at it and goes, this will never pass. He put it in the back burner. These [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=502.2s)]
*  guys got paid for 18 months. So he's just saying, I need somebody on the outside, doesn't need to be [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=505.96000000000004s)]
*  elected to go in and make some tough decisions. I think all Elon wants to do is take Brian Kilmeade. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=510.76s)]
*  Brian would send an email that would say, I did Fox and Friends on Monday, and I did radio on [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=515.4s)]
*  Monday. On Tuesday, I did Fox and Friends. I did radio. Wednesday. Yeah, just one week of what you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  did just to make sure you're a live body and you're a real person. Yeah, I feel I understand what [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=525.4s)]
*  you're saying. You do feel for the federal workers that are getting lumped in and are worried about [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=531.16s)]
*  losing their jobs. But I think the purpose of this is not necessarily it's if you respond to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=534.84s)]
*  the email, it sounds like you have a good chance of surviving. That's right. Yeah, but then again, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=540.68s)]
*  if your advisor says don't do it, that's so complicated. Ultimately, this is going to be [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  tied up in courts for a while. And in fact, some of the people who've brought lawsuits have prevailed [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=552.52s)]
*  where I saw yesterday, a group of employees, probationary employees who were fired last week [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=558.3599999999999s)]
*  got a 45-day stay as they take a look at it. Ultimately, Democrats and others say that it's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=565.0s)]
*  unconstitutional. You need the power of Congress to get closed agencies and things like that. But [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=571.0s)]
*  I'll tell you, over the last five days, I've been down in Texas and I talked to a lot of people down [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=577.48s)]
*  there who are not part of the federal government. Right. But they've either got a family member [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=583.96s)]
*  or an in-law or a friend or they know a guy who got that letter. But y'all the majority of the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=590.5200000000001s)]
*  country supports the cuttings. No, no, I get that instantly. But if you got the letter, you were [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=595.96s)]
*  just very, very concerned and you're worried about the future. Who knows whether or not those people [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=602.6800000000001s)]
*  will be let go? Well, the Consumer Bureau, the Consumer Bureau, they was put out there by Elizabeth [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  Warren. Yeah. That the whole division was caught. Oh, that's been controversy when Trump was in the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=614.76s)]
*  first time. Yeah, from the very beginning. So Elizabeth Warren is not happy with that. And [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=620.36s)]
*  she's having all these meetings about all the vitriol is flying about how the must people don't [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=625.64s)]
*  know what they're doing. They're just cutting out. They're just trying to get tax cuts for billionaires. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=633.56s)]
*  Brett Cooper was on, I think with you. Yes, yesterday. So she has tons of more than a million [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=637.4s)]
*  followers, 1.2 million on Instagram, on YouTube, 1.4. When she had a show, her podcast, eight million, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=642.52s)]
*  nine million people would listen to it. So she was on with us. She's a Gen Z or she's young. She's in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=649.16s)]
*  her early 20s and she's become very successful. She was a COVID student in college when she [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=654.04s)]
*  graduated, didn't know what she was going to do. Started working for PragerU and then her career [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=658.84s)]
*  just built because so many people like what she's saying. She's a conservative. She said she [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=662.84s)]
*  voted for Trump and she said this is why young people, more young people voted for Trump than [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=667.4s)]
*  Kamala. I think we were just ready for something new, especially after Biden, because obviously [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=672.36s)]
*  the system wasn't working. And so when looking at my generation, I think that they realized like, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  let's burn it down. Basically, let's try something new. We're willing to walk away from what we've [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=683.48s)]
*  known and what we've been told is empathetic and inclusive and correct. And you know what young [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=687.88s)]
*  people should believe. And we were willing to try something new. MAGA is, you know, the raging [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=692.92s)]
*  against the machine and young people are rebellious and they're willing to try something new. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=698.28s)]
*  I can't blame her generation or my generation. You got folks that can't afford a house, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=702.28s)]
*  but we're sending money to foreign governments and all. I mean, it just doesn't feel well. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=706.76s)]
*  And I think that the Democrats, the argument that they make is process. They're not targeting the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  issue of waste, fraud and be. Jasmine Crockett, she went on the Charlemagne's The Breakfast Club [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=718.68s)]
*  and said, and he asked her, do you think that waste and fraud is a big issue? And she goes, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=723.2399999999999s)]
*  not at all. That is not a mainstream point of view, even for people in her party. So you can stand [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  with the workers that are for our federal government and say, look, I want a fair process for you. But [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=734.8399999999999s)]
*  you have to understand most Americans want cuts to happen. And if you keep being on the other side, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=739.88s)]
*  you're going to find yourself. We're almost to the midterms already. That started at the moment [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=745.56s)]
*  Donald Trump was elected. If you run on that, you're going to lose again. Yeah. So I think [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=749.7199999999999s)]
*  we're going to see a lot of it's splayed out for the public today with, you know, and Brian was [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=754.3599999999999s)]
*  mentioning how they're going to have a forum today, Senator Warren with the Consumer Financial [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=759.16s)]
*  Protection Board. Keep in mind, it was Elon Musk who said, what was it? Whatever that acronym, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  CFPB, RIP, that was a week or two ago. He obviously wants to get rid of it. Interestingly enough, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=771.0799999999999s)]
*  and this would be great to see, Elizabeth Warren has invited Elon Musk. Okay, we're going to have [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=778.5999999999999s)]
*  this forum. You come on here and explain how people are going to be protected from unscrupulous [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=783.16s)]
*  lenders if this goes away. So it would be great to see that happen. 71% of students ages 18 to 25 [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=790.28s)]
*  support Doge and 62% found a strong majority of all-American support Doge efforts to reduce [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=797.32s)]
*  waste fraud. Right. People like the idea of cutting waste to use something like when it gets to their [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=803.24s)]
*  backyard. That's right. They want to cut programs, social programs, so they don't want to cut their [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=806.44s)]
*  social programs. That's why an outsider is so necessary to come in. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HevV83thg0I&t=809.5600000000001s)]
