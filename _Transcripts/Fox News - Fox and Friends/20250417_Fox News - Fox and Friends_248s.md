# Clooney shares big regret from 2024, pegs Dems' next leader
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08)
*  So George Clooney, y'all remember back in the summer, it was June 10th, 2024. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=0.0s)]
*  He wrote that letter to the New York Times, basically saying, I love Joe Biden, but the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=5.92s)]
*  title was I love Joe Biden, but we need a new nominee. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=10.98s)]
*  And he wrote, he can't win this fight against time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=13.48s)]
*  None of us can. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=15.88s)]
*  It's devastating to say it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=16.88s)]
*  But that Joe Biden that I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe Biden [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=17.88s)]
*  in 2010 or even the one in 2020. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=21.76s)]
*  He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=24.72s)]
*  Well, that got the ball rolling for Biden to be pushed out and for Kamala Harris to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=27.8s)]
*  move in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=31.92s)]
*  Here's George Clooney. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=32.92s)]
*  I don't know if it was brave. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=33.92s)]
*  It was a civic duty because I found that people on my side of the street, you know, I'm a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=38.16s)]
*  Democrat, I was a Democrat in Kentucky, so I get it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=45.24s)]
*  When I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that was [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=51.8s)]
*  time to... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=55.0s)]
*  Are people still mad at you for that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=56.0s)]
*  Some people, sure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=58.0s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=59.0s)]
*  You know, listen, the idea of freedom of speech, you know, the specific idea of it is, you [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=60.0s)]
*  know, you can't demand freedom of speech and then say, but don't say bad things about me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=66.48s)]
*  Listen, he's on hit play right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=70.28s)]
*  That's why he died. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=74.24s)]
*  Broadway play, yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=75.24s)]
*  But so he went on to say that he had to do it, civic duty, got it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=76.6s)]
*  He says that Obama was not a part of it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=81.18s)]
*  He also said that Westmore would be his pick to lead the party now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  He's got it all together in Maryland. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  He's got the military background. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  He's got a great personal story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=91.28s)]
*  But he, like Obama, he said, I don't want Kamau Harris. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=94.2s)]
*  He said I wanted a mini primary leading up to the convention. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  So that's exactly what Obama wanted. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=102.56s)]
*  But Brian, he's also rewriting history. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=105.0s)]
*  First of all, he saw Joe Biden before the debate performance as he pins the letter and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=108.28s)]
*  talks about he didn't say anything then. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=115.24s)]
*  Obama didn't say anything then. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=117.72s)]
*  All these other aides didn't say anything then. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=119.56s)]
*  It was only after the debate performance when they said something. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=121.88s)]
*  So don't try to be self righteous. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Don't say that you're trying to do your patriotic duty, your civil duty for the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=127.56s)]
*  You don't care. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=132.28s)]
*  You obviously cared. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=133.28s)]
*  You obviously cared or you would have let us know way before that debate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=134.28s)]
*  He never would have written that letter to the New York Times, the one I'm holding right [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=137.92s)]
*  here, if we all had not watched and witnessed that debate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=140.76s)]
*  But I will say, George Clooney, yes, blame all the Democrats who knew it wasn't the same. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=144.92s)]
*  Joe Biden never said anything. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  But you can't blame him for losing the election because after that debate, Joe Biden was going [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=152.04s)]
*  to lose. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=157.56s)]
*  No one would have ever voted for him or very few would have. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=158.56s)]
*  Maybe some would have because they just don't like Trump. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=161.2s)]
*  They had no choice. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=164.56s)]
*  But they should have done a mini primary to pick another leader. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=166.52s)]
*  That was the right thing to do, to do the mini primary. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  But I don't think it would help. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=171.84s)]
*  All of them were going to lose. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=173.72s)]
*  They destroyed this country for four years. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=174.72s)]
*  Opened the border. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  They were going to lose because people loved Donald Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  They wanted a difference. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  People did not like what was happening with the country and they all lied about it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  Told people that, oh, the border is secure. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=185.08s)]
*  Joe is fit. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  You know, the economy, what did they say? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  Inflation is transitory. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=190.24s)]
*  I mean, all of the lies finally caught up to him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=191.24s)]
*  I would say this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=194.92s)]
*  The Kamala Harris did the worst of both worlds. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=196.64s)]
*  She ran as a different change candidate who said, I would have done nothing different [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=199.88s)]
*  than Joe Biden. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=203.68s)]
*  So if they had a jungle primary, they would have had to have said, yeah, I'm really unhappy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=204.68s)]
*  with the way Joe Biden ran the country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=208.6s)]
*  I could do it better as a Democrat. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=210.48s)]
*  And not one person was willing to do that that I could tell. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=212.4s)]
*  Certainly not his vice president. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=215.36s)]
*  And he did not let her off the hook. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=216.8s)]
*  He said, remember, no air between us, nothing between us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=218.84s)]
*  And she didn't push back because she had no ideology anyway. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=221.98s)]
*  So by the way, I just resented everyone, including Jake Tapper in that shot, who's going to make [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=225.34s)]
*  money off writing the story of the demise of cognitive disabilities of Joe Biden. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=229.22s)]
*  They said nothing for four years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gumkb-yc08&t=236.22s)]
