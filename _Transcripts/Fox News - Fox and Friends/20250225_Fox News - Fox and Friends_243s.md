# Anti-ICE activists post photos of LA agents: 'Targets on their backs'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I)
*  Okay, that translates, careful with these faces. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=0.0s)]
*  And we've blurred them out, but those are six people [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=3.0s)]
*  who were involved in ICE and the raids out in LA. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=6.24s)]
*  It gives their name, gives their address. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  I think it gives their phone numbers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=11.48s)]
*  They are being doxed. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=13.18s)]
*  Obviously, they are trying to intimidate the good guys [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=14.68s)]
*  into not going after the bad guys. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=19.06s)]
*  So the question is, are we gonna allow this [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=21.52s)]
*  to happen in our country? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=22.92s)]
*  We're gonna allow the cartel to win in our own country? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=24.22s)]
*  We're gonna let them put our faces of our cops [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=27.22s)]
*  that's trying to keep. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=29.44s)]
*  You got murderers, rapists that have flooded the country [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  because Biden wanted to open up the border [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=34.08s)]
*  and let 10 million people come in the country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=35.68s)]
*  And now finally, with the cops are able to do their job, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=37.92s)]
*  this is why we have 30 cops on one bus for one guy, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=40.28s)]
*  because it's not safe. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=44.72s)]
*  They're putting their pictures up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=46.08s)]
*  Their families are at risk as a result of this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  They're probably gonna have to pull these cops off duty [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=49.0s)]
*  because they can't do their job [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=51.28s)]
*  and be able to protect their family back home. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=53.32s)]
*  There has to be legal consequences. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=56.08s)]
*  So I'm just waiting for Pam Bondi [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=58.04s)]
*  to figure exactly who these activists are and prosecute them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=60.0s)]
*  They're aiding and abetting an entire criminal enterprise. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=63.28s)]
*  ICE is saying they're not really sure who these people are [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=66.68s)]
*  that are hanging up these posters, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=68.88s)]
*  but they are aware, they are investigating. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=69.96s)]
*  The LA FBI is warning those who interfere [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=71.92s)]
*  with law enforcement investigations [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=74.16s)]
*  could face prosecution. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=76.02s)]
*  And DHS says these pathetic activists are putting targets [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=77.6s)]
*  on the backs of our law enforcement [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=81.24s)]
*  as they shield MS-13, Trindaya Ragwa, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=83.4s)]
*  and other vicious gangs that traffic women and children, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=86.28s)]
*  kidnap for ransom, and poison Americans with lethal drugs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=89.6s)]
*  These individuals will be held accountable [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=93.0s)]
*  for obstructing the law and justice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=94.76s)]
*  This shouldn't be controversial. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=96.72s)]
*  Right, and also some other things [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=98.72s)]
*  that are important to point out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=101.04s)]
*  The mayor, Bass, arguably the worst mayor in the country, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=102.04s)]
*  was trying hard to be number one, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=106.0s)]
*  and she's halfway there, believe in yourself. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=107.84s)]
*  She also went out of her way to say this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=110.36s)]
*  No one should live in fear due to their immigration status. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=112.0s)]
*  Los Angeles is a city of immigrants. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=115.26s)]
*  We'll continue to stand together, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=117.06s)]
*  except of course with Bill Mollusian posted right after. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  And that's the amount of illegal aliens [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=121.34s)]
*  who are arrested for horrific crimes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=123.34s)]
*  At a Guatemalan 18th Street gang member, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=125.98s)]
*  I would fear him convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=128.1s)]
*  a Chinese convicted child predator. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=130.86s)]
*  I believe that's a problem. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=132.58s)]
*  You should fear a Mexican drug trafficker, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=133.74s)]
*  a Guatemalan convicted manslaughter assailant, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=135.96s)]
*  Guatemalan convicted of rape with a gun. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=140.1s)]
*  That's Bass who say these are the people, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=142.06s)]
*  as Bill Wright says that we should have fear, I believe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=144.06s)]
*  So this is an idea of the difference between the two parties. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=149.46s)]
*  One sees illegal immigrants were a melting pot. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=153.58s)]
*  Other sees there's a difference between criminals [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=156.52s)]
*  and people who are here legally. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=159.7s)]
*  Well, it also goes to the point, okay, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  you see the rap sheet of all those people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=163.1s)]
*  You left these people back on the street? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=166.02s)]
*  Who does that? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  New York. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=170.1s)]
*  How is that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  New York and Chicago and Philadelphia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=171.76s)]
*  It's a type of common sense. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=172.6s)]
*  And I think, I just wish they would look at the polling data. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=174.16s)]
*  Still over 60% of the country is for mass deportations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=177.04s)]
*  You would think with all these rallies and all that, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=180.6s)]
*  that the tide would change. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  But the country is aware because these folks [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=184.92s)]
*  aren't staying in the rich neighborhoods, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=188.12s)]
*  as my last guest said, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=189.84s)]
*  that ran for city council in Boston. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=191.78s)]
*  They're staying in the poor neighborhoods. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=193.64s)]
*  So they have to experience those criminal aliens [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=195.16s)]
*  in their community. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=198.04s)]
*  Well, and ultimately these sanctuary cities [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=199.24s)]
*  are still sanctuary cities for a lot of these bad guys. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=201.72s)]
*  The president says if there's one thing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=205.08s)]
*  he wants to pick up the pace on in immigration, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=207.12s)]
*  it's the criminals. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=209.8s)]
*  Find a way to round up those criminals and the kids. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=211.0s)]
*  By the tens of thousands of kids we can't track. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=213.64s)]
*  It's the lowest single apprehension day [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=217.44s)]
*  in over 15 years this past Saturday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=219.28s)]
*  CBP encountered only 200 illegal aliens [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=221.4s)]
*  at our US southern border. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=224.4s)]
*  And Kristi Noem writes, thanks to President Trump [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=226.04s)]
*  and our brave men and women of CBP make America safe again. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=228.92s)]
*  It's working. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNg2nNOMy4I&t=232.56s)]
