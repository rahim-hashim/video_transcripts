# This could have proved the ‘catalyst’ to re-elect Trump: Turley
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8)
*  The Manhattan DA witch hunt against me has been postponed because everyone realizes that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=0.0s)]
*  there was no case because I did nothing wrong. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=11.08s)]
*  It's a witch hunt. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=14.08s)]
*  It's an attack by my political opponents in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=15.08s)]
*  Former President Trump lashing out at Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg and Washington Democrats after [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=20.92s)]
*  Judge Juan Roshan postponed his sentencing in the case until after the presidential election. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=26.0s)]
*  Here to react, George Washington University Law Professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=31.92s)]
*  Turley. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=36.08s)]
*  Professor, great to have you with us this morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=37.08s)]
*  Thank you, Will. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=38.92s)]
*  I think everyone has acknowledged most objective, rational people have acknowledged the weakness [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=39.92s)]
*  of the initial conviction of Donald Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=45.96s)]
*  And then that was confirmed somewhat with the Supreme Court saying he has presidential [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  immunity on so many aspects that would have ended up undermining the New York conviction. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=52.32s)]
*  But do you think Judge Roshan, professor, who I think has been fairly obstinate and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  not worrying about the law and pursuing what looks like a political case, do you think [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=64.24s)]
*  he was impacted by the political fallout should he have sentenced Donald Trump? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=69.2s)]
*  Well, I think so. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=74.56s)]
*  He might actually have been sort of subconsciously or consciously aware that if he hit Trump [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=76.92s)]
*  with a jail sentence, he very well could have reelected him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  Every time the public saw what was happening in Manhattan, Trump went up in the polls. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=88.64s)]
*  And I think Roshan knew that he could very well prove the catalyst to reelect the president. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  This president has been fairly hostile towards Trump in all of his rulings. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  I was in that courtroom and I was shocked by many of his rulings, which in my view [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=106.04s)]
*  were manifestly wrong. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  And also this sudden epiphany that we're in an election seems rather belated. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  This is the same judge who refused to curtail his, in my view, unconstitutional gag order, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  kept the president in that courtroom during the campaign and never indicated any concern [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=127.2s)]
*  over the fact that this was in the middle of a campaign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=132.44s)]
*  By process of elimination, Professor, that's why I keep coming back to this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=136.6s)]
*  He didn't care about true precedent or legal justification. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=139.6s)]
*  He didn't care about the impact on an election when he thought it might help to the point [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=144.04s)]
*  of the gag order. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  The only thing that's changed now is I think he cared that it might help Donald Trump actually [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  if he had sentenced him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Another political case, well, another case that touches on politics is Hunter Biden. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=157.72s)]
*  And so now Hunter Biden has pled guilty to filing false tax returns. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  Two counts, let me put up on the screen here, of felony tax evasion, one count of felony [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=167.76s)]
*  failure to pay, four counts of a misdemeanor failure to file, two counts of a misdemeanor. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=172.64s)]
*  Now Joe Biden, asked recently, by the way, Kareem Jean-Pierre doubled down, tripled down, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  that there will be no pardon for Hunter Biden. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=184.98s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, almost two years ago I wrote a column saying that I thought there was a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=189.84s)]
*  real chance that Joe Biden could withdraw from running for reelection and pardon his [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=194.88s)]
*  son on the way out and accept that this was the misuse of that pardon authority. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=200.28s)]
*  That is still a real chance. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=206.68s)]
*  By setting the calendar as it has been, this puts the decision right in the sweet spot [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=208.12s)]
*  for the Hunter Biden team, where they would want this decision to be made after the election [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=217.06s)]
*  with weeks before the inauguration. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=221.82s)]
*  That's when we've seen the greatest abuse of the pardon power occur. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  That's when Bill Clinton waited to the very last day to pardon his brother, which was [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=228.1s)]
*  just a manifestly improper act in the use of his authority. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=233.02s)]
*  But it was a legal act. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=237.74s)]
*  This is not, there's not a restriction on the pardon authority in this sense. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=239.62s)]
*  So I think that the Hunter Biden team is probably hoping that this is still a real possibility. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=244.44s)]
*  Also, if the judge hands down a particularly harsh sentence, it's going to increase the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=249.76s)]
*  pressure on Joe Biden to reverse his promise. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=254.62s)]
*  Remember, this is the one who said that the Lord Almighty would have to tell him to leave [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=258.8s)]
*  the race, and then he left the race. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=262.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=265.4s)]
*  So how much stocks we put in that he won't, him saying he won't pardon Hunter Biden. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=266.4s)]
*  By the way, on the sentencing, to your point, just as an interesting note, sentencing date [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=270.96s)]
*  is currently set at December 16th for Hunter Biden, leaving that one month window, three [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=274.76s)]
*  week window for a pardon right there from Joe Biden. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=279.68s)]
*  We'll wait and see. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhNQnpNAjh8&t=283.12s)]
