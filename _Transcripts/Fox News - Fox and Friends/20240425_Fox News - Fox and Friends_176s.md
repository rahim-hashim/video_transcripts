# 'The mob is ruling campus,' Columbia student warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE)
*  I want to bring in Elliot Sadoff right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a senior at Columbia University. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=2.2s)]
*  He's going to graduate hopefully in a couple of weeks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=4.0s)]
*  Elliot, great to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=6.04s)]
*  Great to see you. Thank you for having me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=7.24s)]
*  How difficult have these last weeks been? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=8.58s)]
*  It's been very difficult, not just for me, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=10.68s)]
*  but for every Jewish student on Columbia's campus [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=12.48s)]
*  and even non-Jewish students. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=14.88s)]
*  It's just complete atmosphere of chaos. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=16.38s)]
*  The mob is ruling campus, and it seems for now [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=19.12s)]
*  that no one's doing anything to stop it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=21.62s)]
*  And what is the encampments that are taking over your center square? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=23.12s)]
*  What makes up those? Who are those people? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=28.0s)]
*  So a large percentage, I would think, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=30.36s)]
*  are students from Columbia's campus [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=32.1s)]
*  who really want to make their message clear [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=33.64s)]
*  that Jewish and Israeli students aren't welcome on campus. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=36.84s)]
*  But we've seen these groups posting themselves online [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=39.04s)]
*  that there are non-students on campus, public anti-Semites, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=42.84s)]
*  coming in, giving speeches [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  and giving their support to these students. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=47.32s)]
*  But also New York City council members, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=49.22s)]
*  all these random people coming in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=51.82s)]
*  and really riling up these protesters. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=53.28s)]
*  You were there when the speaker came to your campus. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=55.06s)]
*  You were there when the speaker came to your campus yesterday. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=60.36s)]
*  It was very tense on campus. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=61.4s)]
*  I mean, if the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=63.0s)]
*  is coming to campus, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=65.2s)]
*  you should listen to what he has to say. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=66.4s)]
*  These protesters are really claiming [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=67.8s)]
*  that they want free speech, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=69.2s)]
*  so you should welcome in his perspective, let him speak. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=70.4s)]
*  It was nothing of the sort on campus like that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=73.1s)]
*  People were drowning him out, heckling him the entire time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=75.08s)]
*  I couldn't hear everything he was trying to say. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=78.04s)]
*  And for Jewish students who do not feel safe on campus, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=79.84s)]
*  who are being attacked, intimidated, harassed, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=82.88s)]
*  I think that's a very important element of unsafety. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=85.97999999999999s)]
*  And if the speaker of the House wants to change that, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=87.72s)]
*  I welcome him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=89.52s)]
*  You're going to class anyway. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=90.52s)]
*  I have to. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  I can't give in to the mob rule of students on campus [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  trying to intimidate me and my fellow Jewish classmates. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=96.02s)]
*  So it means something to you personally. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=98.3s)]
*  You have to make sure you're not intimidated. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=100.16s)]
*  I do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=101.86s)]
*  I'm paying the same money to be there as these other students. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=102.66s)]
*  I have just as much a right to be on campus [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=105.0s)]
*  as a Jewish student, and I can't give in to that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=106.8s)]
*  How would you describe your emotions? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=109.08s)]
*  Are you enraged, are you angered, are you sad? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=110.3s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=112.28s)]
*  I'm very angry. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=113.28s)]
*  I'm very sad. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=114.28s)]
*  I'm very sad that the Jewish schools administration, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=115.36s)]
*  that while I applauded their original action [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=116.64s)]
*  to remove student protesters from campus [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=118.44s)]
*  who were violating the laws, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=120.38s)]
*  now the school's been letting it go on. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=121.94s)]
*  It's the ninth day of this and nowhere to be seen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=123.8s)]
*  And have they asked for Jewish representatives [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  of the student body to sit with the president [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=129.68s)]
*  to find out your point of view? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=131.98s)]
*  A little bit, but recently, no. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=134.08s)]
*  It's been almost radio silence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  While the administration sends out some emails [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=137.12s)]
*  to students updating them on what's going on, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=139.06s)]
*  it's pretty much we're being left to fend for ourselves. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=141.12s)]
*  We have protesters, faculty, students cheering this on, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=143.72s)]
*  riling it up, and it's terrible. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=147.44s)]
*  It's terrible, but it shouldn't diminish. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=150.24s)]
*  You gotta get an Avie Lee degree, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=151.56s)]
*  let everyone know you're not part of this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  You've worked hard in high school, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=154.52s)]
*  and you're probably gonna go on to law school, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=156.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=158.06s)]
*  All right, Elliot, hang in there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=158.9s)]
*  I'm so glad you have the courage to go to campus anyway. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=159.74s)]
*  They should be providing security for all you guys. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=161.76s)]
*  They should. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5hyItrhzE&t=163.84s)]
