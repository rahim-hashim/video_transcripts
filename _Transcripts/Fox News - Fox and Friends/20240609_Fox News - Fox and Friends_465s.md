# IDF spokesperson reveals 4 hostages were held hostage by Palestinian civilians
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg)
*  This morning, four innocent Israelis safely back home with their families after being [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=0.0s)]
*  kidnapped by brutal Hamas terrorists and held hostage in Gaza for eight months. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=4.8s)]
*  The daring IDF rescue carried out in a densely populated refugee camp, where the hostages [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=11.22s)]
*  were held in the homes of civilians. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=16.64s)]
*  Joining us now, former IDF spokesperson Jonathan Konrikis, also a former lieutenant colonel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=20.22s)]
*  in the IDF. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=26.04s)]
*  Sir, thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=27.04s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=28.72s)]
*  For our audience, how did this go down? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=29.72s)]
*  Well, it went down after weeks of planning, collecting intelligence from various sources, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=31.88s)]
*  including doing preparations and operations in order to gather intelligence on the ground, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=37.44s)]
*  which then finally allowed Israeli commandos, the elite of the elite Israeli special forces, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=43.64s)]
*  to understand where they were being held and then to launch an operation that basically [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  hit two locations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=54.64s)]
*  And the key thing was to do it simultaneously. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=56.72s)]
*  The underlying assumption was that if Israel hits one place where Noah or the other place [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=59.14s)]
*  where the three men were being held, if we don't do it simultaneously, the risks for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=65.14s)]
*  the lives of the other location or the hostages being held in the other location were very [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=70.32s)]
*  high. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=74.88s)]
*  So it had to be simultaneously. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=75.88s)]
*  Israeli troops were able to infiltrate without being noticed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=77.88s)]
*  So this means they were wearing civilian clothes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  They were not—didn't come in in a military formation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=82.96s)]
*  No, they didn't advertise their advance ahead of time, and they surprised the Hamas [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  guards and the civilian sentries that Hamas has deployed along the area. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  They got to the locations, burst in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=98.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, in one of the locations, an Israeli special forces soldier was severely [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=100.64s)]
*  wounded. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=106.64s)]
*  He later died of his wounds, which is a terrible loss for Israel. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=107.64s)]
*  He is a real bona fide hero. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=111.4s)]
*  His name was Arnon, and the operation is now named after him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=114.6s)]
*  He was the leader of the counterterrorism unit. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=119.68s)]
*  And what the Israeli troops did was go in simultaneously, get the hostages out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=123.12s)]
*  And the more difficult part became actually the vehicle exfiltration. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=128.64s)]
*  And this is a very densely populated area, very small alleys, very—lots and lots of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=133.56s)]
*  people around it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=139.24s)]
*  And what basically happened was that one of the vehicles got stuck. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  And when they got stuck, they came under tremendous fire. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  I'm talking massive machine gun fire, RPG, rockets. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=148.0s)]
*  It was a really intense situation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  That is also where I think most of the Palestinian casualties that we see the Palestinians touting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  on international media, and it gets a lot of attention, the amount of Palestinian casualties. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Most of them were in that area, where Israeli troops came under a lot of fire, with the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=166.12s)]
*  hostages in the vehicle. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  And then finally, thanks to an envelope of fire and the Israeli soldiers fighting their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=172.56s)]
*  way out, made their way towards the coast, where two helicopters awaited. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  And the first helicopter took no auto safety, and then the second helicopter took the other [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=182.16s)]
*  force with the three Israeli hostages out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=187.12s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=190.0s)]
*  You mentioned weeks of planning. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=191.0s)]
*  I even read that they built a mock-up of a couple of these apartment rooms. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=192.2s)]
*  I mean, that's how sophisticated this was in their desire to get inside quickly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=196.12s)]
*  Yes, and that is the level of detail that they had to have in order to have any chance [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=199.04s)]
*  of success. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=203.64s)]
*  And that must be a reflection of serious real-time intelligence. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=204.64s)]
*  Does that mean the Israelis have somewhat of a sense where most of the hostages might [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=209.4s)]
*  be held? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=213.28s)]
*  Sadly, I don't think it does. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=214.28s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=216.36s)]
*  You know, this was made possible because Hamas decided to jail these hostages and to have [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=217.36s)]
*  them above ground in a civilian populated area. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  And we've seen this in the past. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=228.2s)]
*  This isn't the first time that Hamas jails Israeli civilians in a civilian Palestinian [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=229.32s)]
*  environment. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=234.44s)]
*  And where, by the way, the people who were guarding and forcing the Israeli civilians [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=235.44s)]
*  to stay there were Palestinian civilians. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=239.9s)]
*  It's all a civilian situation here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=241.84s)]
*  But many other Israeli hostages are presumed to be held underground in specially defended [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=244.28s)]
*  Hamas compounds, with instructions for the Hamas guards there that as soon as you hear [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  any kind of IDF activity, you execute the Israeli hostages. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=256.88s)]
*  And that is, of course, the main scenario that Israel wants to prevent. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=260.48s)]
*  There have been successful Israeli raids in the past. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  In Rafah, about three months ago, Israeli forces, again, were able to go in unnoticed [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=268.64s)]
*  and save two Israeli men, civilians, who were taken from the kibbutzim. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=274.24s)]
*  What does this tell you about the strength of Hamas at this? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=279.0s)]
*  This is an area that's been cleared, but it's not fully cleared, obviously. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=283.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=287.4s)]
*  You mentioned sentries. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=288.4s)]
*  Those are civilians that have walkie-talkies, and they're willing to give a heads-up to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=289.4s)]
*  Hamas if something looks suspicious. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=292.28s)]
*  Are they reconstituting in places where you can't have Israeli troops all the time? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=295.0s)]
*  So what we know that they're doing is that with hostages, they've been moving them around. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=299.36s)]
*  These hostages that were now saved, they were in different locations. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=304.92s)]
*  They tell Israeli soldiers and intel officers after they were saved that we were moved around. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=309.24s)]
*  And that is what Hamas has been doing with the other hostages as well, to make it as [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=314.96s)]
*  difficult as possible for Israel to actually get in. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=319.44s)]
*  They've been shifting them around. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=322.64s)]
*  Move around in civilian populations is the strategy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=324.28s)]
*  In civilian population, in civilian houses, sometimes underground, sometimes above ground, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=326.4s)]
*  with the full knowledge and complicity, and in many cases, active participation of Gaza [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=331.44s)]
*  and Palestinian civilians. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=337.96s)]
*  And that's a very important point, because what Hamas does by its strategy is constantly [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=340.0s)]
*  to muddle the line between what's military and what's civilian. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  And they always try to—all of their fighters, they're dressed in civilian clothes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=348.88s)]
*  And then they tout them as civilian casualties. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=353.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  They get reported as such in international and international media. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=355.79999999999995s)]
*  I want to get your comment as well, because there were some anti-Israel protesters surrounding [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=359.88s)]
*  the White House. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=363.28s)]
*  They defaced some monuments. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=364.28s)]
*  They're calling out, Genocide Joe, chanting, you know, you're a sellout. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=365.88s)]
*  Pack your bags and get the hell out. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=370.24s)]
*  Submitting red paint on Andrew Jackson. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=371.96s)]
*  I mean, these protesters are really angry at Joe Biden's approach to what's going [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=373.64s)]
*  on in Israel. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=380.08s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=381.08s)]
*  So, I've been at protests like these around the world, not only in the U.S. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=382.08s)]
*  I've seen them in Scandinavia. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=387.32s)]
*  I've seen them in other parts of Europe. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=389.12s)]
*  I've seen them in the U.K. and I've seen them here in the U.S. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=391.0s)]
*  The common denominator that I see is a lot of hatred towards the West, a lot of anti-American [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  sentiment. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=400.16s)]
*  Sure, the Jews in Israel are front and center of most of the vicious rhetoric here and most [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=401.16s)]
*  of the hatred. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  But what I see is a bunch of people who do not respect American values, who do not respect [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  Western values and are very bloodthirsty towards Israel. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=414.48s)]
*  What I'm concerned is that more and more of public domain is slowly but surely being [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=418.8s)]
*  conquered by this type of people, anarchists who have no respect for the past and who are [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=424.88000000000005s)]
*  – who stop at nothing in order to get their messages across. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  Real quick, just is Israel given the ability to actually take out Hamas? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=434.12s)]
*  Is America holding back Israel from finishing the fight? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  I think that Israel would likely want to fight harder and faster. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=442.92s)]
*  And I think that Israel should be doing that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=448.48s)]
*  And I think that it would be in the interest of Israelis and Palestinians to get the job [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=450.56s)]
*  done faster and quicker, to get the suffering done. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKORf4wHPYg&t=455.24s)]
