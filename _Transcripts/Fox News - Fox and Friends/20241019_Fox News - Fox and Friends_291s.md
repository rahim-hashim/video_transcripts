# Dems tout ties with Trump in campaign ads
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q)
*  One thing I am sure you guys are with me on this, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  like I've become increasingly skeptical of, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=2.56s)]
*  is our attempt to pull an election all the way through. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=4.32s)]
*  It's hard to know what to trust based on history. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=8.28s)]
*  By the way, betting markets, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=11.56s)]
*  we're learning more about betting markets as time goes by [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=12.84s)]
*  because it's a new way of measuring. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=14.84s)]
*  They've moved heavily in favor of Donald Trump recently. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=16.88s)]
*  But you probably have no better indicator [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=19.88s)]
*  of how this election is going than to look, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  as Charlie pointed out earlier, down ballot. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Axios is watching what's happening down ballot [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=26.26s)]
*  and here's their headline. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=29.36s)]
*  Endangered Democrats begin to brag about their ties [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  to Donald Trump in the final stretch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  From Pennsylvania to Wisconsin to Michigan, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=36.02s)]
*  Democrats not just putting an arm's length distance [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=39.64s)]
*  between them and Joe Biden, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=44.8s)]
*  but in some cases embracing Donald Trump. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=46.58s)]
*  Casey bucked Biden to protect fracking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=51.24s)]
*  and he sided with Trump to end NAFTA [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=54.0s)]
*  and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=56.16s)]
*  Tammy Baldwin got President Trump [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  to sign her Made in America bill. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=61.48s)]
*  And then she got President Biden to make it permanent. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=63.12s)]
*  That's why I wrote a law signed by President Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=65.92s)]
*  forcing drug companies to show their actual prices. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's stunning. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, in Wisconsin, Tammy Baldwin didn't want, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=74.6s)]
*  you know, she said she was busy, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=78.56s)]
*  couldn't meet with Kamala Harris when she was in the state. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=79.56s)]
*  But you have to think about these consultants that, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=82.88s)]
*  they do these internal polling. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=85.16s)]
*  So these candidates have spent, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=86.36s)]
*  especially Senate candidates. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=88.48s)]
*  They know way more than we know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=89.64s)]
*  They have internal polling [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=92.16s)]
*  that they're not gonna share with anybody [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  that's going to tell them what's going on [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=94.76s)]
*  on the ground with their voters. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=97.28s)]
*  And if they're cutting commercials that say, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=99.2s)]
*  I'm with Donald Trump and they're Democrats, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=101.48s)]
*  boy, that's as you said, a really clear indicator. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=103.72s)]
*  You just have to, I just love the visual [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=107.16s)]
*  and thinking about the consultants coming to the candidates [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=109.2s)]
*  and saying, listen, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=112.08s)]
*  this is what you have to do in the next commercial. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=113.64s)]
*  It's like putting a gun to their head, you know? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=115.32s)]
*  It's like, they're like, what? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  I hate this guy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  I've been saying how horrible he is that he's, you know, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=119.78s)]
*  Hitler and now I have to, you know, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=122.72s)]
*  do a commercial saying, I'm with him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=125.24s)]
*  Campaigns lie, candidates lie, polls lie. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=127.61999999999999s)]
*  What doesn't lie is the ad that the campaign puts on TV. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=130.68s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=133.84s)]
*  And Dave McCormick, who's running against Bob Casey [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=134.76s)]
*  in Pennsylvania was on with Jesse saying that, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=137.68s)]
*  you know, Democrats may actually wish [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  they still had Joe Biden on the ballot. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=144.64s)]
*  I think Democrats are recognizing that at least [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden would have been a better [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=149.96s)]
*  candidate than Kamala Harris. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=152.4s)]
*  You know, he was Scranton Joe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=154.4s)]
*  He had these relationships with the unions [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=155.64s)]
*  and key Democrats. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=157.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a San Francisco liberal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=159.44s)]
*  that is completely out of touch with Pennsylvania. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=161.54s)]
*  Ban fracking, defund the police, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=164.2s)]
*  mandatory buybacks of guns. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=166.44s)]
*  The list goes on and on in her own words. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=167.8s)]
*  And President Trump is gaining real momentum here [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=170.08s)]
*  in our polling. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=172.4s)]
*  He's in the lead and gaining. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  And in our polling, I'm tied and gaining. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=175.84s)]
*  And that's because people are recognizing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  that this is a race between strength and weakness [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=182.44s)]
*  and common sense policies in this radical liberal agenda [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=185.8s)]
*  that career politician, weak Bob Casey has supported [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  every step of the way. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  And that's why we're gonna win in Pennsylvania [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  because that choice is becoming more and more clear. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=196.68s)]
*  Pennsylvania is 25% Catholic [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  and the Catholic vote is really important as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  Again, that's another area where Joe Biden, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  even though I don't think he was a great Catholic, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=207.6s)]
*  he was, you know, his abortion policies were despicable, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  but he would run in his campaign ads, holding the rosary [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=211.94s)]
*  sort of, he's a cultural Catholic, if you will. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=216.04s)]
*  And he was able as an Irish Catholic to sort of put [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=218.16s)]
*  that out there and appeal to them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=220.83999999999997s)]
*  Kamala, and by the way, Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=222.76s)]
*  he's been doing a lot of interesting moves. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=225.72s)]
*  It wasn't just that rally that he appealed to Catholics [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=227.72s)]
*  where he said, you know, he had the Ave Maria [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=230.78s)]
*  and he, you know, that right before the rally, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=233.16s)]
*  he posted the prayer to St. Michael, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=235.32s)]
*  but he's been posting things about Polish saints. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=237.56s)]
*  There's a very big Polish Catholic population there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=240.36s)]
*  So he's making all kinds of moves. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=242.98s)]
*  And then of course you have the Al Smith dinner [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=244.62s)]
*  with, you know, Donald Trump showing up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=246.96s)]
*  So pay attention to the Catholic vote, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=249.02s)]
*  specifically in Pennsylvania, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=251.38s)]
*  wherever the Catholic swing vote goes, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=253.64s)]
*  usually that candidate wins. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=255.56s)]
*  I'm just thinking about how amped up you get [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  whenever the topic turns to Catholics. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=262.36s)]
*  Catholics, yes, here we go. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=264.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, we're powerful. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  That's how I feel when we talk about Texas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=270.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=271.32000000000005s)]
*  That's how I feel about God. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=272.16s)]
*  That's how you feel about football. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=272.98s)]
*  You know, I didn't say God. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=274.72s)]
*  I didn't say Protestants. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  I didn't say religion. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  I said Catholic. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=278.16s)]
*  Well, anyway, it's a very interesting, you know, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=280.04s)]
*  appeal that these candidates have to make. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=284.12s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump is leaving nothing on the table [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=286.68s)]
*  when it comes to that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsvSGCN0Q&t=289.68s)]
