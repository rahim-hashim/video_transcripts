# Trump drawing 'momentum and joy' as polls show dead heat
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY)
*  Now, with just six days until Election Day, America's largest newspaper chain, USA Today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=0.0s)]
*  and its 200-plus affiliates opting not to endorse a candidate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=4.84s)]
*  The following, the Washington Post deciding and the LA Times deciding not to endorse a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=9.56s)]
*  candidate. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=13.48s)]
*  In those cases, the owners of those newspapers decided to trump the editorial page and stay [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=14.48s)]
*  out of it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=19.44s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris not pleased and pointing fingers at former President Trump [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=20.44s)]
*  and his rich friends? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=25.16s)]
*  Disappointing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=27.16s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=28.16s)]
*  But the other piece of it is, it gets back to my point about who is Donald Trump because [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=29.56s)]
*  he is the one, right, who is up for election with me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=36.08s)]
*  And you know, he, I think that some of your listeners, they know and others may not, which [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=40.44s)]
*  is that, look, it's billionaires in Donald Trump's club. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  What is she even talking about? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=51.72s)]
*  Why is everything back to Donald Trump? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=55.64s)]
*  Fox News contributor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=57.28s)]
*  Wall Street Journal editorial board member Bill McGurn, former speechwriter for George [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=58.64s)]
*  W. Bush joins us now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  You really blame Trump for the lack of endorsements? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=64.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=66.6s)]
*  Good morning, Brian. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=67.6s)]
*  It's preposterous. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=70.04s)]
*  You know, obviously the owners decided that they need to take this step. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=72.56s)]
*  I have a lot of sympathy for the owners because the employees have just behaved preposterously. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=77.8s)]
*  The idea that they decide the editorial page. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=86.36s)]
*  But that said, Jeff Bezos talked about, you know, having credibility by not endorsing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  anyone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=97.24s)]
*  The real problem with like the Washington Post and other papers is not the editorial [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=98.24s)]
*  pages. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  It's that most of the news pages are also a continuous editorial for Kamala Harris. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  They're just perceived as biased. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=110.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  If you just look at the lead story, four of five are negative towards Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Media Research Group did a study. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=118.84s)]
*  Eighty plus percent of the stories on Trump are negative. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=120.76s)]
*  Seventy four percent of the stories are positive for Kamala Harris. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=123.6s)]
*  How could that possibly be a case where someone is wrong eight out of every ten times and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=127.32s)]
*  someone is right eight out of every ten times? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=132.48s)]
*  So your thoughts about where this race is right now, Bill? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=135.4s)]
*  Well, my thoughts are pretty conventional. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=140.4s)]
*  It's very tight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=142.52s)]
*  It does seem that Donald Trump has shifted in last month, maybe two or three points in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=143.96s)]
*  the national polls. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=149.16s)]
*  In the battleground states, I think he's ahead in most states. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=150.56s)]
*  All within a margin by one point. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=155.56s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, I think he's ahead by point six points. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=158.08s)]
*  So it's very tight there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=163.6s)]
*  And we'll have to see an election night. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=167.08s)]
*  But I think they're going to battle to the end. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=169.12s)]
*  But I would say the momentum and not just the momentum, the joy seems to be switching [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  There's not much joy coming from Kamala Harris. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  The Trump rallies and Trump meetings, they all seem pretty friendly. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=182.72s)]
*  People are having a good time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  And meanwhile, Democrats, we have Joe Biden, you know, stepping on Kamala Harris's speech, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=188.24s)]
*  calling half the country garbage and so forth. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=195.4s)]
*  We have all these things. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  People worried about Kamala Harris. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  So Bill, I'm looking at when the polls close in Michigan, eight o'clock, Nevada is ten [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  o'clock Eastern, North Carolina, seven thirty, Pennsylvania, eight. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=207.16s)]
*  Most of the battleground states seems to be in the East. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Does that mean we could get a verdict on election night? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=214.24s)]
*  Yeah, it should mean it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=216.88s)]
*  I mean, first we should say there's no excuse for not having the results within hours of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=219.12s)]
*  the polls closing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=225.84s)]
*  Florida, a very populous state, does it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=227.28s)]
*  They went from hanging Chad's, you know, in Florida to being a model in 2020. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  So they should have them in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, they have disputes now, mail in ballots heading to court. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  I think they're not allowed to start counting them until after the polls close. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=246.36s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  That guarantees a delay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  Thanks so much, Bill McCurn of the Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=256.12s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3GXKmAEWY&t=257.12s)]
