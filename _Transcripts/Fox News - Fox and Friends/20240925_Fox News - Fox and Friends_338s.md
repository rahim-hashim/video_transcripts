# Inexperienced USSS agent called toll-free number for help at Trump rally: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4)
*  The U.S. Senate has just released its interim report on the Secret Service's many failures [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=0.0s)]
*  leading up to that first assassination attempt against former President Trump in Butler, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=6.08s)]
*  Pennsylvania, right there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=10.68s)]
*  And it's such a damning report. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=11.68s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson has the details on that report. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=13.68s)]
*  Hey, Lucas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=16.04s)]
*  Good morning, Lawrence. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=17.04s)]
*  The new preliminary bipartisan Senate report is more than 100 pages long, and what stands [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=18.04s)]
*  out is some Secret Service agents telling the committee they had no knowledge of any [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=22.48s)]
*  threats to the former president. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=27.28s)]
*  Here are some of the other key findings to the report. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=29.04s)]
*  No clearly defined individual responsible for planning and security of the event. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=31.88s)]
*  The AGR building, including the roof, was not, quote, effectively covered. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=36.24s)]
*  Ineffective communication, coordination with state and local law enforcement. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=40.6s)]
*  Secret Service requests—Secret Service denied requests for additional assets ahead of time, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=44.8s)]
*  and failures to prevent Trump from taking the stage relay info on a, quote, suspicious [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  person. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=55.16s)]
*  Now, also in the report, the lead advance agent was told that credible intelligence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=56.16s)]
*  existed of a threat, but still wrote in a security planning document that there was, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=60.16s)]
*  quote, no adverse intelligence concerning the visit to Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  The report also says requests for counter drone equipment were denied. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  The Secret Service agent responsible for overseeing counter drone systems at the July 13 rally, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=73.36s)]
*  quote, lacked experience and knowledge about the equipment and called a toll-free tech [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=78.32s)]
*  support hotline for help. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=83.88s)]
*  According to testimony from agents from Trump's Detail and the Pittsburgh Field Office, neither [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=86.68s)]
*  of them were aware at the time when 27 minutes before the shooting, the Secret Service's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=90.92s)]
*  security room and counter sniper team was informed that a suspicious person had been [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  spotted near that AGR building near where Trump was speaking with a range finder. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=101.2s)]
*  And the shooter eventually took position on that roof, of course, and fired those shots [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=106.56s)]
*  and nearly killed the former president, guys. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=110.2s)]
*  So Lucas, I've got just a question, and I don't know if you can clarify or if you know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=113.36s)]
*  the answer. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  So we had heard that the Trump campaign was denied aerial assets. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  They were denied a drone going into that event. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=123.44s)]
*  But then you just told us about the inexperienced drone operator or this agent who was given [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=126.4s)]
*  one hour of informal training, apparently couldn't figure out how to get it in the sky, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=132.0s)]
*  called the 1-800 number. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=137.28s)]
*  So did they decide at the last minute, okay, we denied it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=139.36s)]
*  Maybe we need to put something up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=142.56s)]
*  This was a counter drone system. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=144.4s)]
*  So while we now know that the shooter, Thomas Crooks, was using a drone, the Secret Service [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=146.62s)]
*  agent assigned counter drone equipment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=151.44s)]
*  He didn't know how to use it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's why he called that toll-free number to try to figure out how to down drones, apparently. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much for clarifying that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  To put in— [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=162.8s)]
*  Thank you, Lucas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=163.8s)]
*  Thanks, Lucas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=164.8s)]
*  To put it in perspective, you know, at Fox News, we have a drone team, our flight team. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=165.8s)]
*  They have way more training than one hour. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=169.86s)]
*  Okay, so why does someone— [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=172.04s)]
*  They need a license. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=173.04s)]
*  They need a license. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=174.04s)]
*  They go through weeks of training for it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=175.04s)]
*  Why are the people that are just capturing news for our viewers have more training than [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=177.12s)]
*  someone that's supposed to be an asset? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=181.68s)]
*  Also the thing that I just found stunning when it comes to the threat to Iran, the Secret [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=183.6s)]
*  Service agent that's in charge of the detail and events found out about the Iranian threat [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=188.4s)]
*  from news reports. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=194.32s)]
*  So you mean to tell me that the director of national intelligence is not communicating [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=196.12s)]
*  with the Secret Service director who's not communicating with the person that's over [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=201.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's advance? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=205.96s)]
*  They weren't given the information. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=208.44s)]
*  Requests were denied. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=211.4s)]
*  The site agent didn't even know about the threats as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=212.4s)]
*  So I mean, we're just talking about egregiousness all around. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=215.32s)]
*  You know, Melania's been posting these video clips ahead of her book coming out, and we're [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=218.88s)]
*  interviewing her that the interview will be tomorrow. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  And we're going to ask her about this because imagine if that's your husband. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=227.68s)]
*  He's running for president and you find out that the team that is protecting him, someone [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  who was hired to protect him, has no idea how to use the equipment that is used to protect [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=242.56s)]
*  And I'm not blaming that Secret Service agent because they tried to figure out how to use [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=243.56s)]
*  it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Whoever that person's boss is doesn't need to put that person on the ground protecting [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  a potential president of the United States. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=252.72s)]
*  They never even watched the perimeter of the whole event even though they knew the threat [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=254.2s)]
*  was high. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=257.24s)]
*  If you knew the threat was high enough to put snipers in place, why wasn't that relayed [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=258.44s)]
*  to others, including the local police? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=262.68s)]
*  So the snipers knew why they were there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  Are they at every single event? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=266.76s)]
*  And why, you know, they knew exactly how to take this guy out the minute the shot came [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=268.36s)]
*  out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=271.92s)]
*  We don't know that level of detail. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=272.92s)]
*  And we know almost nothing about this 20-year-old. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=274.08s)]
*  We saw a few shots of his parents shopping. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=277.68s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=280.72s)]
*  And they quickly had to cremate the body. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=281.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=283.52s)]
*  And to your point about that counter-assault team, only a portion of the team was there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=284.52s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, right down the street, and this is no offense to the First Lady, Jill [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=290.32s)]
*  Biden, she had the entire team that was there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=294.84s)]
*  Also, I understand they should be communicating more. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=298.52s)]
*  But why do I, I'm not assigned to protect the president. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=302.2s)]
*  I knew about the threat to Iran. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  We knew that all the former ambassadors have protection now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know, Brian, maybe you can speak to it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=311.28s)]
*  They took it from Robert O'Brien. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=313.0s)]
*  Are they giving it back to him, by the way? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=314.48s)]
*  So we knew about Pompeo needing extra security. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=316.28s)]
*  Why do agents assigned to protecting the president say they don't know about the threat when [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=319.08s)]
*  it's been public information? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=324.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=325.48s)]
*  We're going to be talking about this throughout the day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70ZZws4hU4&t=326.48s)]
