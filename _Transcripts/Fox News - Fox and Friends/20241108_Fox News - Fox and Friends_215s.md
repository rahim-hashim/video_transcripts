# California’s shocking 2024 electoral map flip a ‘wakeup call for Democrats’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc)
*  So California Governor Gavin Newsom McQuarrie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=0.0s)]
*  and quote, the freedoms we hold dear in California [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=2.44s)]
*  are under attack and we won't sit idle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=5.32s)]
*  He's calling for a special legislative session [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=8.52s)]
*  to safeguard liberal California policies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=10.72s)]
*  The state's attorney general also warned [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  of a second Trump term. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=15.32s)]
*  You can be sure that as California attorney general, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=18.12s)]
*  if Trump attacks your rights, I'll be there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=23.46s)]
*  If Trump comes after your freedoms, I'll be there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=29.0s)]
*  If Trump jeopardizes your safety and your wellbeing, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=34.88s)]
*  I'll be there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Fox News contributor and civil rights attorney, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=42.0s)]
*  Leo Terrell joins us now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=44.18s)]
*  So Leo, you got violent criminals all over the state, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=45.44s)]
*  attacking people, stealing people's personal property, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  because they passed a law that said you can steal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  under a thousand dollars without the police showing up [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  to the scene. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  I never remembered the attorney general banging [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=59.12s)]
*  on the table saying he's gonna be there for them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  You know Lawrence, did you hear what he said? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=66.2s)]
*  He said nothing, just word salad. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=67.56s)]
*  And what you have is you have Governor Newsom, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=69.84s)]
*  who is a lame duck governor trying to become relevant. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=71.88s)]
*  It's a lame duck idea. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=76.6s)]
*  They're gonna have a legislative session in December [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=77.7s)]
*  to stop President Trump. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=81.72s)]
*  Trump doesn't take office until January. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=83.28s)]
*  And here's the point that's amazing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=85.8s)]
*  They can't stop Trump from removing illegal immigrants [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=88.08s)]
*  out of California. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  They cannot stop ICE from arresting illegal immigrants [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=92.64s)]
*  who have committed crimes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  They can't do any of that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  They're just talking. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=99.8s)]
*  They're trying to remain relevant. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=101.0s)]
*  And one point, Prop 36, a bill to increase penalties [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=102.64s)]
*  for shoplifting passed by 70%. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  Gavin Newsom was opposed to that bill. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=111.08s)]
*  These Democrats are in denial, Lawrence, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  they don't listen to the average American voter. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=117.44s)]
*  Trump does, they don't. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=120.32s)]
*  Well, it's also a little delusion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=122.88s)]
*  I mean, let's just pop up this map of California. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=124.84s)]
*  I've never seen California with so much red. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=127.8s)]
*  I mean, if you just compare it to 2020, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=130.76s)]
*  you would think there would be some self-reflection [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=133.76s)]
*  and say, hey, maybe we need to change some things [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=136.16s)]
*  or we may flip it to being a Republican state. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=138.36s)]
*  I'll tell you what the problem is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=143.92s)]
*  The Democrats don't wanna tell the truth. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=144.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's message resonates with the average voter. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=147.64s)]
*  That graphic earlier today on the show proves it all. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=151.56s)]
*  Democrats is the party of the elite, the rich. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=154.56s)]
*  Most working class Americans support the Trump policies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=158.68s)]
*  And what you saw on that map, Lawrence, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=162.6s)]
*  was California, a deep, deep blue state [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  becoming a purple state because of one person, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=168.28s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=172.32s)]
*  That map is a wake-up call for Democrats. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  But the problem is they're asleep. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=176.44s)]
*  They're in denial. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=178.08s)]
*  Yeah, they're too busy calling everything racist [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=179.6s)]
*  and misogynist. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Every single group of people increase their turnout [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=184.96s)]
*  when it comes to Donald Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=188.52s)]
*  I think at some point you have to say, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=190.88s)]
*  look, our policies are failing people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=194.08s)]
*  And if you want them back, maybe respond to those issues. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  Leo, thanks so much for getting up this morning. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=199.4s)]
*  My pleasure. Any time for you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=203.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=204.6s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJhkvkiUcGc&t=205.52s)]
