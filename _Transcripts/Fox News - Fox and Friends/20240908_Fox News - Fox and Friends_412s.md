# 'FROM BAD TO WORSE': Biden-Harris admin called out for 'driving' people into 'poverty'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs)
*  Former President Trump rallying Wisconsin voters calling out Vice President Harris' [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=0.0s)]
*  record on the economy after a weaker than expected jobs report. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=4.36s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=8.8s)]
*  Harris cast the tie-breaking votes that caused the worst inflation in American history, costing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=9.8s)]
*  a typical family $28,000. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=15.76s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=18.52s)]
*  Yesterday, it was announced that we lost 438,000 full-time jobs in August. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=19.52s)]
*  We lost 400, almost half a million jobs in August. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=26.02s)]
*  We lost 24,000 manufacturing jobs, nearly 6,000 auto manufacturing jobs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=29.88s)]
*  Here to react is CEO of Goya, Bob Inaue. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=36.64s)]
*  Bob, it's so great to have you on this morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=39.16s)]
*  So you heard Donald Trump in Wisconsin talking about the economy, hammering away what he [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=41.76s)]
*  did versus what the Biden-Harris administration has done. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  How do you think that this is going to go in the debate? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  How will Kamala respond to these kinds of attacks and, frankly, stats, data? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=52.9s)]
*  Well, thanks, Rachel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=59.36s)]
*  So great to see you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=61.36s)]
*  You know, you have two records that are very clear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=63.0s)]
*  Donald Trump had prosperity, and the Harris-Biden administration gave us inflation and basically [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=66.88s)]
*  poverty. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=74.44s)]
*  You know, they're driving us into poverty. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=75.44s)]
*  Poverty is slavery. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=77.56s)]
*  You know, their original — they started off by declaring war on fossil fuels, the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=78.56s)]
*  Green New Deal, a weakness around the planet which drove war in Ukraine, which was a very [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=85.08s)]
*  productive agricultural country, Russia and Ukraine with 50 percent of the world's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=92.0s)]
*  fertilizer, which tripled the cost of fertilizer. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=99.28s)]
*  You know, we've just gone from bad to worse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=102.48s)]
*  The record is very clear. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=105.48s)]
*  I just — I don't know how they can spin it that we're better off than we were before. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=106.92s)]
*  You know, I've worked 50 years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=113.64s)]
*  I'm 70 years old. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=115.32s)]
*  The average Social Security check — the other inflation is taxes and Social Security. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=118.6s)]
*  The average Social Security check is $1,200. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=124.16s)]
*  Illegals coming into this country receive nearly $4,000 in benefits. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=127.6s)]
*  You know, we need to get up every day with purpose, God, family, work, and work is very important. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=132.72s)]
*  You know, why educate ourselves to produce, to make a difference when the government says, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=138.44s)]
*  hey, just stay in your bunker, don't get up, we're going to take care of you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=145.48s)]
*  There's no reason to, you know, get — use this beautiful mind and body that the Lord has given us to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=150.4s)]
*  produce and to work. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=158.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think she's going to have a hard time defending this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=160.76s)]
*  It's going to be a very, very interesting debate, no doubt about that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=163.64s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about what else you do on the side, because you're the CEO of Goya. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=168.4s)]
*  You're clearly providing a great service to our country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=172.56s)]
*  You do a lot in Latino groceries, especially, and products. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  But you also give a lot. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  So this Thursday, Bob, you're going to receive the 2024 HOPE Award from an organization that I am part of. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=182.44s)]
*  I'm on the board. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=188.68s)]
*  Jesse Waters' wife Emma is also — it's called HOPE through Education for Doing Your Part and Educating and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Protecting God's Children. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=196.36s)]
*  This organization, Bob, as you know, provides scholarships for kids who are trying to escape public [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  schools that aren't working for them, for economically disadvantaged kids. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=203.0s)]
*  And it gives them scholarships to go to classical schools, Catholic schools, private schools. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  Tell us why you wanted to be part of this and unite with Goya Cares, your organization, and HOPE through Education. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=213.52s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you know, what you do is so incredible and so many other people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=221.4s)]
*  And, you know, it's your heart that makes an incredible difference. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=225.12s)]
*  But, you know, the children are under attack today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=231.36s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=234.68s)]
*  You know, HOPE in education. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=236.16s)]
*  There's HOPE in educating ourselves. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=237.72s)]
*  Like I said, why educate yourselves if you're not going to use the gifts that God has given you? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=239.72s)]
*  You know, Jesus said, let the children come to me for the kingdom of God is for such as these. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=246.88s)]
*  And, you know, there's an amazing industry that the Harris Biden administration has created, has expanded and exploded. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=254.4s)]
*  There's two industries, the biggest industries in the world, child trafficking and drugs, trafficking in drugs. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=266.96s)]
*  Seventy five percent of the victims are women. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=273.64s)]
*  Twenty five percent are children. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=276.76s)]
*  We're allowing ourselves, we're selling our souls. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=278.76s)]
*  And we're this administration is working on power, control and greed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=282.20000000000005s)]
*  The hundreds of billions of dollars in this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, we need to educate our children. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=290.92s)]
*  We need to lift ourselves out of poverty. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  And this HOPE in education is the way to do it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=295.72s)]
*  And, you know, it's just horrific what's been happening to our children. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  The U.S. is the biggest consumer. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=305.92s)]
*  And, you know, this was under the watchful eye of the border czar, Kamala Harris, who has allowed our children to be exploited. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=308.32s)]
*  You know, and as long as we we sell our soul, we're giving out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=318.32s)]
*  You look at the big cities, all the handouts. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=322.32s)]
*  You know, I've worked my whole life to get a small Social Security check if I if I take it, if I ever decide to retire. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  But people are coming into this country that have never worked and they're not only that committing crimes and we have to work all day to, you know, to get a measly Social Security check. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=334.36s)]
*  You know, we have to have purpose in our lives. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  God, family work. We need a reason to get up every day. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=351.0s)]
*  Well, you're, of course, referring to our open border and what has happened. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=354.16s)]
*  Three hundred thousand children have been lost by the Biden administration. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=358.04s)]
*  Many of them have fallen into sex, slavery and trafficking, and no one on the left is talking about it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  Nobody cares. And but you do. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Goya cares. That's your organization. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=370.76s)]
*  You're raising awareness about child sex trafficking. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  And you're also going to schools, along with Hope Through Education, to educate children so they don't fall into this as well. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  Bob, you are an amazing businessman. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  But more importantly, you're a man of God and a philanthropist. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=384.64s)]
*  And we thank you for your work through Goya Cares and through Hope Through Education. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  And I look forward to being at that event where you'll very rightfully receive that award. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=391.12s)]
*  Bob, we love you. Thanks for joining us today. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  Love you, too. God bless. Look forward to seeing you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYtMDZT_Qs&t=398.35999999999996s)]
