# Kamala Harris has a long track record of defying the law: Emily Compagno
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs)
*  Despite liberal arguments that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=0.0s)]
*  a new Wall Street Journal op-ed points out Kamala Harris's own past [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=4.0s)]
*  of defying the Constitution. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=8.0s)]
*  As California's attorney general, she refused to enforce a ballot measure [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=10.0s)]
*  on same-sex marriage, unilaterally deeming it unconstitutional. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=14.0s)]
*  Then, under her current administration, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=19.0s)]
*  Biden and Harris have continued to cancel billions in student loan debt [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=21.0s)]
*  despite the Supreme Court finding one of their plans unconstitutional. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=25.0s)]
*  Her administration is also facing a lawsuit for allowing millions of migrants [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=28.0s)]
*  to maneuver around federal law and apply for permanent residency. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=32.0s)]
*  And a House Judiciary Committee found that the Biden-Harris White House [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=37.0s)]
*  worked with big tech to censor opposing narratives. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=40.0s)]
*  Here to react is outnumbered co-host Emily Campagna. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=44.0s)]
*  We always hear them say, when Trump was going through all the court cases, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=47.0s)]
*  that nobody is above the law, yet they're defying the law. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=50.0s)]
*  That's right. And the whole point here is that Kamala Harris [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=54.0s)]
*  has a long track record of doing that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=57.0s)]
*  Defying, for example, Proposition 8, which 52 to 48 percent passed in California, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=59.0s)]
*  that's the will of the voters. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=65.0s)]
*  She stood in her attorney general platform and said, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=66.0s)]
*  it's unconstitutional, I refuse to defend it as attorney general. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=68.0s)]
*  But the reality was that was her job. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=72.0s)]
*  You're supposed to, regardless of how you feel about something, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=74.0s)]
*  represent and fulfill the duties of your role. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=77.0s)]
*  If she started doing it back then, if she's done it through the student loans [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=80.0s)]
*  and the migrant and everything and the voting, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=82.0s)]
*  how can we trust her to fulfill the duties of the commander in chief [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=84.0s)]
*  lawfully without just imposing her will over the will of the American people? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah, California voted and same-sex marriage did become legal, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=91.0s)]
*  even though she said it was unconstitutional. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=94.0s)]
*  All right, you have a new book coming out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=96.0s)]
*  It's right here. It's called Under His Wings, and we can preorder it today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=98.0s)]
*  Incredible stories, Emily. Tell us more about it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=101.0s)]
*  It is an extraordinary book, Ainsley, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=104.0s)]
*  because of the stories inside that I am honored to serve as a messenger for. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=106.0s)]
*  It's all about faith on the front lines, incredible stories of service men [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=111.0s)]
*  and women that had intimate, deep experiences with God on the battlefield [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=115.0s)]
*  in combat from the thick of a firefight in Iraq to the jungles of Vietnam [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=120.0s)]
*  where an infantryman heard God's voice telling him where to go to survive, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=125.0s)]
*  POWs surviving torture sessions, even World War II veterans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=129.0s)]
*  I have members of my family in the book, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=134.0s)]
*  and we also talk about how the war doesn't end in the physical battlefield. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=136.0s)]
*  The war remains on the front lines. We have incredible stories of faith [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=140.0s)]
*  and, again, these intimate experiences with God and Jesus here on the home front [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=144.0s)]
*  with PTS, with Gold Star mothers, with those that are dealing with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=148.0s)]
*  and managing spouses that are catastrophically wounded. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=152.0s)]
*  These stories are incredible. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=155.0s)]
*  They will change your life as they change the service men and women who experience them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=157.0s)]
*  And, again, it's my honor and privilege to serve as a messenger [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=161.0s)]
*  for those who proclaim their faith in Jesus Christ [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=164.0s)]
*  and for those who come out with these deeply personal stories. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=166.0s)]
*  Beautiful, beautiful. There was one soldier who said he had a vision. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=169.0s)]
*  He didn't know whether or not to go left or to go right. Tell us his story. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=172.0s)]
*  That's right. He was a Vietnam veteran and, at the time, an infantryman in Vietnam. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=175.0s)]
*  And the ambushes that he suffered were so severe, so intense. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=180.0s)]
*  And in the thick of one, he heard God's voice directing him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=184.0s)]
*  To the left was heaven, to the right was hell. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=187.0s)]
*  And he says, look, I can't tell you anything more than what I experienced, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=190.0s)]
*  and I know that I survived by going left. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=193.0s)]
*  And now, every time he goes to the Vietnam Memorial Wall, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=196.0s)]
*  he has a cup of coffee with the 58,000 men that didn't make it home, toasts them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=199.0s)]
*  Emily, it's a beautiful book. Under His Wings is the name of it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=204.0s)]
*  So you can begin pre-ordering Emily's new book, Under His Wings, today on FoxNewsBooks.com. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=208.0s)]

*  Great job, Emily. I'm proud of you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=219.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ainsley. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=221.0s)]
*  Thank you for writing this in the name of the Lord. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=222.0s)]
*  The title of the book, Under His Wings, comes from Psalms. It's beautiful. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=224.0s)]
*  That's right. So I bless you. Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvPUaGlSrCs&t=228.0s)]
