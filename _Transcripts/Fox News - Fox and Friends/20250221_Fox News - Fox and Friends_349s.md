# BREAKING: Israel makes shocking announcement after Hamas returns hostage remains
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc)
*  The Israeli military says Hamas has violated the ceasefire agreement after failing to return [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=0.0s)]
*  the body of Sheree Bebas, a young mom who was taken hostage by the terror group. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=7.88s)]
*  And the Trump administration has a new warning for the terror group. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=18.92s)]
*  It's a clear violation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=20.22s)]
*  And if I have one piece of advice for Hamas now, it's not only do you need to release [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=22.48s)]
*  her body immediately. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=28.3s)]
*  If I were them, I'd release everybody or they're going to face total annihilation right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=30.26s)]
*  Here to discuss this is anchor and executive editor of Special Report Brett Baer. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=35.14s)]
*  Good morning, Brett. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=39.42s)]
*  Morning, Aisley. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=40.42s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=41.42s)]
*  Terrible story. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=42.42s)]
*  We, they were the faces of October 7th in many ways because they were, there were babies [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=43.42s)]
*  involved. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  But now the body is back and it turns out it's not even hers. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=49.540000000000006s)]
*  Whose body is it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=53.7s)]
*  What happens because they violated the ceasefire? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we don't know whose body it is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=58.54s)]
*  They just confirmed it was not hers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  Obviously we saw and they confirmed the other three, including, it's hard to believe, but [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=62.78s)]
*  a nine month old and a four year old who were not killed in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=68.14s)]
*  They were murdered according to authorities in Israel and the U.S. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=72.7s)]
*  And now you have the Israeli prime minister saying that Hamas will pay the price for what [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=77.06s)]
*  he called brutal and malicious acts in violation of the ceasefire. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=83.3s)]
*  I heard General Keene earlier on your show with Brian saying his bet is that the IDF [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=87.42s)]
*  is going to go back in if they don't see some real action. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=93.9s)]
*  Now remember this comes after President Trump said all hell was going to break loose if [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=98.22s)]
*  the hostages were not all released last Saturday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=103.06s)]
*  We saw some released which kind of moved things forward but they weren't all released. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  And then they had the spectacle of the small coffins which even Arab leaders Ainsley had [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=112.7s)]
*  to weigh in on because it was so heinous in the world's eyes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=118.5s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=123.78s)]
*  First of all, who could kill a baby when you look at those pictures? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=124.78s)]
*  Who, so evil, heartless to be able to do that and see those coffins leaving from the Red [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  Cross and they're all cheering and some of the kids were cheering on the other side in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  Gaza and we exchanged terrorists or Israel exchanged terrorists for the bodies of babies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=138.22s)]
*  And then you're right, Donald Trump did say all hell will break loose. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=143.82s)]
*  What does this look like from the world stage, Brett? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=147.54s)]
*  Well I think first of all the depravity and brutal nature of Hamas is up and open and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=151.82s)]
*  anybody who's defending Hamas has a really hard time in the wake of those babies' coffins. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=160.94s)]
*  And I think that Israel is emboldened to try to go back in if they have to. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=168.1s)]
*  Obviously they want to get all the hostages who are alive back and all the bodies back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=175.38s)]
*  But we may be at a point where this is going to tip the other way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=180.66s)]
*  Yeah, we're in the final stages of the ceasefire and the final six hostages are supposed to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=183.86s)]
*  be released tomorrow. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about something else and switch gears. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  James Carville was on Weshon last night and he argues the Trump collapse is underway and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=191.78s)]
*  he's telling Democrats just to basically sit back, play possum and watch. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=197.7s)]
*  Listen to this and we'll get your reaction. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=201.26s)]
*  Democrats, just sit there, play possum, let them go, let them go, let them go. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=203.26s)]
*  Poll numbers are declining. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=210.14s)]
*  The collapse is already underway. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=212.42s)]
*  Let's see when they put the Medicaid budget, when they put the tax, the $4.5 billion, $3 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  million of tax cuts to wealthy people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  Just let the ball come to you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=224.42s)]
*  We don't need to be aggressive now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=226.06s)]
*  I mean, Brett, it's not even factual. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=228.1s)]
*  The poll numbers are not declining. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=230.42s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=232.61999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, listen, a lot of what has happened so far and the speed at which it's happened has [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=233.61999999999998s)]
*  been well received. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, after four years of waiting for things to transpire, this president has signed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=241.1s)]
*  73 executive orders in the first four weeks. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=246.1s)]
*  That's more than 300 actions, executive actions, and a lot of it is considered very positive. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=250.94s)]
*  Now, what James Carville is talking about there are things that are in the ether here [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  about what it means for Medicaid, Medicare. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=261.66s)]
*  What about these federal workers? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=264.74s)]
*  You know, he points to Virginia specifically because yes, there are a lot of federal workers [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  in Northern Virginia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  But remember, this past election, Virginia almost went Republican despite it was considered [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=272.1s)]
*  a purplish blue. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=277.62s)]
*  So, you know, it's interesting to see the prognostication because Democrats are just [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  trying to hold on to something that they can say, this is it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=284.66s)]
*  This is the moment. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=288.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=289.94s)]
*  What do you think will happen in the midterms? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=290.94s)]
*  He's saying that the Democrats will take Virginia and Winsome Sears, who's the current lieutenant [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=291.94s)]
*  governor, she's running for governor. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  She says, be my guest. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=298.86s)]
*  She said, I'll invite him to my inauguration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=300.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=302.54s)]
*  Oh, she's an impressive candidate and obviously has the blessing of a very popular governor [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=303.54s)]
*  and Glenn Youngkin. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=309.1s)]
*  Listen, we're a long way away from the midterms, but it really does depend on what Congress [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=311.1s)]
*  can do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=316.18s)]
*  You know, all these executive orders are significant and they make big transformational changes, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=317.18s)]
*  but they're only good until the next president. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=321.18s)]
*  What really the big changes that stick around forever, as if some of this stuff is codified [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=323.38s)]
*  into law by Congress and what that budget looks like that they've been fighting about. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=328.86s)]
*  I don't have any salt like Chad or any props, ping ponging, but he's got us covered up there [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  and it's going to be something to watch. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=340.94s)]
*  I have some salt. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  I'll give it to you the next time I see it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  Do I see you? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=346.17999999999995s)]
*  Thank you so much, Brett. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEXQWt_nlYc&t=347.94s)]
