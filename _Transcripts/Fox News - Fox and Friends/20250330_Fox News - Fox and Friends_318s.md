# 'REMARKABLE': WH Chief of Staff praised for 'pivotal' role #trump #foxnews #politics
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g)
*  New York Post columnist Miranda Devine joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=0.0s)]
*  Miranda, good morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=4.4s)]
*  Good morning, everyone. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=7.46s)]
*  What a fantastic interview that was. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=8.8s)]
*  Absolutely, she's a fascinating figure. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=10.88s)]
*  First of all, let's just note Miranda [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=13.08s)]
*  that the two women who've ever led presidential campaigns [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=14.6s)]
*  have come from Donald Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=19.2s)]
*  And then Donald Trump made Susie Wiles, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=20.5s)]
*  his second campaign manager in his second term here, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=22.6s)]
*  his chief of staff as well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=27.96s)]
*  She is a quiet, interesting figure. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=29.7s)]
*  What did you gleam from this interview? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=31.86s)]
*  It's so rare. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=35.06s)]
*  It really is, and hats off to Lara Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=37.36s)]
*  for a terrific interview [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=39.98s)]
*  and for actually securing an interview [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=41.42s)]
*  because I don't think America really knows Susie Wiles. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=43.26s)]
*  She's a very quiet and private figure. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=46.7s)]
*  Donald Trump, in fact, called her the ice maiden. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=51.22s)]
*  But what a warm, really, person she came across [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  in that interview. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  She's warm, capable, and really humble. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=60.46s)]
*  I mean, that's a very rare virtue, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=63.9s)]
*  but she is somebody who, despite all her accomplishments, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=65.74s)]
*  says that she still has things to learn. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=69.82s)]
*  And she said her relationship with Donald Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=72.58s)]
*  is very easy, which you can see. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=75.5s)]
*  But she still wakes up every morning [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=78.66s)]
*  with a bit of a knot in her stomach [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=80.7s)]
*  because there are things she wants to make sure she does right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=82.42s)]
*  She works 14 hours a day, seven days a week. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=87.02s)]
*  But she says she doesn't feel like she needs a day off [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=90.58s)]
*  because what they're doing is so important. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=93.22s)]
*  She's obviously a great patriot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=96.26s)]
*  And she also has this sort of motherly atmosphere. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=99.94s)]
*  And when there are so many young people on the staff, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=106.02s)]
*  and many who, as she said, have young families, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=108.98s)]
*  she says she's quite happy to work before, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=111.86s)]
*  at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  and let them have a little bit of time [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=116.18s)]
*  to go home to their families. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  Just a fantastic boss. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=120.78s)]
*  And the White House Chief of Staff is one of the most powerful, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  pivotal roles in the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  She calls it keeping the trains running on time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=130.66s)]
*  She really manages the president's schedule, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=134.10000000000002s)]
*  who gets to see him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=137.18s)]
*  She's the gatekeeper. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  She makes sure that everything that he wants done, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  she says he came in knowing exactly what he wants done. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=142.06s)]
*  She makes sure that gets executed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=145.06s)]
*  And you can tell her relationship with the president [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=147.7s)]
*  is easy and warm. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=150.7s)]
*  And I guess he doesn't have to worry that the office is, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=152.82s)]
*  you know, about how it's being run. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=157.9s)]
*  Because unlike in his first administration, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=159.34s)]
*  where he had no end of problems with people undermining him [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=161.86s)]
*  and undercutting him and not being competent, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  Suzy Wiles is just the opposite. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=168.9s)]
*  Yeah, Miranda, you mentioned that she said [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  she hasn't taken a day off yet. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=173.3s)]
*  There's a whole lot to get done. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  So here is more from her on that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=176.58s)]
*  I see my job as just sort of keeping the trains [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=180.94s)]
*  on the tracks and running on time here [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=184.02s)]
*  so that the subject matter experts, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  and particularly the president and the vice president, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=188.66000000000003s)]
*  can do what they need to do to fix the country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm at a stage in life where I can do that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  My children are grown, I can do it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=197.34s)]
*  But we start here about 7.30, 7.45. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=200.26s)]
*  And I got home last night at 9.30 or 10. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=203.5s)]
*  That's pretty much Monday through Friday. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=207.62s)]
*  We've been traveling a lot on the weekends. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=210.34s)]
*  So it's a little bit more relaxed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=212.46s)]
*  But I can't say I've really had a day off yet. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=214.02s)]
*  And I don't expect it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=217.78s)]
*  And I don't want it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=219.02s)]
*  There's too much to do to say, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=219.9s)]
*  well, I need to lay by the pool. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=222.3s)]
*  And Miranda, another thing that she talks about is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=224.5s)]
*  after you win a presidential election, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  you think you have four years, but you do not. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=227.98s)]
*  The midterm elections are next year. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=230.54s)]
*  So really you have this 18 month timeframe. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  So with that in mind, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=236.38s)]
*  do you think that the Trump administration [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  can get everything they want to get done [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  within that short window of time? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=241.78s)]
*  I'm sure it's something that the president [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=243.82s)]
*  asks himself every single day. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  Look, that's a very good point, Carly. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=248.98s)]
*  And she did emphasize that, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=250.62s)]
*  that they really feel they only have 18 months ahead [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=252.14s)]
*  to get everything done before, of course, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  they get bogged down with midterm campaigning. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=257.42s)]
*  And gosh, who knows if the Democrats take over [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=259.98s)]
*  and decide they're going to impeach Donald Trump [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=262.66s)]
*  or somehow sabotage him again. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=264.86s)]
*  So look, that's why they're all working so fast. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=267.58000000000004s)]
*  It really is Trump time, it's warp speed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=271.82s)]
*  No one's getting time off, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  but he has an incredible team around him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=276.42s)]
*  And they're run by this remarkable woman. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=278.3s)]
*  I think we're all very lucky that she's there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=280.98s)]
*  And it probably helps that they're all working [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=283.54s)]
*  on very consequential, serious issues, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=286.5s)]
*  which is a pretty significant change [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=289.3s)]
*  for Washington these days. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=291.1s)]
*  Sure is, yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=293.42s)]
*  And look, they've had so many achievements already. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=294.62s)]
*  Look at the border for starters. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=297.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=299.82s)]
*  Great to see you, Miranda. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=300.66s)]
*  The great Miranda Divine. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=302.14s)]
*  We love having you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=304.14s)]
*  Thanks for coming back to us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=305.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=306.7s)]
*  Analysis. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxJvcLZgx5g&t=316.5s)]
