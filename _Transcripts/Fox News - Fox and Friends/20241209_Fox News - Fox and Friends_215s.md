# Trump shuts down NBC hostâ€™s question on 'going after' Biden
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs)
*  Meanwhile, 12 minutes after the hour, Donald Trump sat down and chose Meet the Press for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=0.0s)]
*  his first interview. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=4.76s)]
*  And one of the questions was about retribution. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=6.12s)]
*  Everyone's so concerned about retribution, but by asking that question, do you realize [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=7.92s)]
*  you're saying that he was attacked for no reason? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=12.68s)]
*  You don't want to punch back, do you? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=15.84s)]
*  So he said, listen, success will be my best retribution, but watch. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=17.32s)]
*  I'm really looking to make our country successful. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=23.54s)]
*  I'm not looking to go back into the past. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm looking to make our country successful. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=28.2s)]
*  Retribution will be through success. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=32.16s)]
*  If we can make our success, this country successful, that would be my greatest. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=34.44s)]
*  That would be such a great achievement. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=39.24s)]
*  You wrote on Truth Social in 2023 that you're going to appoint a real special prosecutor [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=40.96s)]
*  to go after Joe Biden. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=45.64s)]
*  Now you're saying you're not going to do that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=46.6s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=49.96s)]
*  No, I'm not doing that unless I find something that I think is reasonable. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=51.08s)]
*  But that's not going to be my decision. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  That's going to be Pam Bondi's decision and, to a different extent, Cash Patel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=58.28s)]
*  Assuming they're both there, I think they're both going to get approved. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=63.72s)]
*  So he's saying, look, I'm not going for it, but if there's something there that's just [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=67.72s)]
*  egregious and they want to go for it, they can go ahead and do it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=70.56s)]
*  But that's not going to be his focus. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=73.44s)]
*  He's got too much to do, especially because just two years, got two votes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=74.44s)]
*  I have the advantage of two votes right now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=79.12s)]
*  Should go up to five in the House. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=81.52s)]
*  So I can't be sitting there focusing on all these investigations. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=83.8s)]
*  It's not going to be his focus. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=87.56s)]
*  But don't you like Cash Patel? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=88.88s)]
*  The more you read about him, he's just so perfect in there to unearth a lot of things [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=90.64s)]
*  that have been buried. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=96.2s)]
*  Well, I think that also Trey Gowdy, when he highlighted the reason, everybody keeps saying, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=97.2s)]
*  for someone that was a staffer, why do people hate Cash Patel so much on the other side? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=102.64s)]
*  Well, Trey Gowdy puts it out there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=107.72s)]
*  He exposed their entire Russian illusion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=109.28s)]
*  That's why they don't want him in there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=112.48s)]
*  He forgave the memo to Devin Nunes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=113.68s)]
*  They don't want him to go in there and cover all the rest of the corruption there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=115.36s)]
*  So I like that Donald Trump said in that interview, OK, look, I'm not trying to go for vengeance [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  or anything like this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  But if Pam Bondi and Cash Patel find some corruption within the department, they're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=123.84s)]
*  going to get it out. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=127.0s)]
*  So he also said he will not fire the Fed chief, Jerome Powell, and he thinks that Pete Hegseth [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  can get confirmed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=133.68s)]
*  There was a real tight change when it comes to getting it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=134.68s)]
*  There was an entire grassroots campaign of people that have known him for years, that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=138.48s)]
*  have been in the movement and said, look, call in their senators. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think the president really put a red line. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=147.16s)]
*  He's telling senators, listen, I want my nominee. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  This is not going to be a Matt Gaetz situation, much different. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=152.88s)]
*  We can't have allegations by unnamed sources win the day. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=156.16s)]
*  Yeah, I thought having his mom on was smart, too. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=160.32s)]
*  That was a big move. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=162.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=163.72s)]
*  I also think he's a fighter for the fighters. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=164.72s)]
*  He's talking about getting families five days of health care on a military basis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  He's talking about getting them the pay increases that they deserve, combat pay in a timely [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=171.28s)]
*  matter. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=175.68s)]
*  Fixing the VA has always been a passion of his. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=176.68s)]
*  So I never thought about that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=178.76s)]
*  So he's going to let the CEO, this very qualified CEO, do a lot of the management stuff, which [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  is just like Mattis did. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=185.48s)]
*  And he's going to focus on the fighters and rules of engagement. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=186.84s)]
*  And that's a lot for the privates and the corporals and the lieutenants who fight these [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=189.92s)]
*  wars and are asked to be deployed for months at a time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  So that's what I think. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=197.2s)]
*  And you've seen a lot of the ads for P2. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=198.2s)]
*  It's looking really, really promising. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=201.04s)]
*  I think that's great. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR4C-h5s_Rs&t=203.11999999999998s)]
