# ‘We will press charges’: Noem responds to ICE protest clashes in LA
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw)
*  The president of the United States was awake last night, concerned about our law enforcement officers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=0.0s)]
*  Pete Hegseth was involved. Everybody was there. What can we do to bring peace? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=4.54s)]
*  What can we do to bring stability? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=8.88s)]
*  What do we do when we have guys like Hakeem Jeffries standing up in front of the world [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  and saying, it's okay to write, kill ICE. It's okay to throw things at law enforcement officers. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=15.74s)]
*  It's okay to do that. That's not okay. Not in America. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=20.38s)]
*  We have rules. We have laws. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=22.98s)]
*  When people are murderers and rapists, they have consequences, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=24.78s)]
*  and we are going to make sure that they face consequences. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=27.86s)]
*  But those statements put out by Newsom and Karen Bass is absolutely ridiculous [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=30.66s)]
*  because what we need is action right now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=35.96s)]
*  I mean, be people that are leaders for once. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=38.2s)]
*  And let's not go back to 2020 when they were burning down the city of Minneapolis [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=40.5s)]
*  and you had people like Tim Walz encouraging it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=45.1s)]
*  I mean, this has been going on now by Democrat politicians for years, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  and that's why Donald Trump is in the White House. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=51.08s)]
*  He's the only guy, the only guy who fights for every single American. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=53.559999999999995s)]
*  And I'm so proud to work for him. I can't believe it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=58.04s)]
*  I can't believe that these dummies in the Democrat Party are still around to get elected. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=60.44s)]
*  Secretary Noem, you talk about consequences. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=65.42s)]
*  One of the folks involved here was Labor Union leader David Huerta. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=67.92s)]
*  Is he going to go to jail? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=74.46s)]
*  And what kind of penalties could we expect to see for him? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=75.72s)]
*  And is this the opportunity to send a statement to so-called leaders [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  about what they do with respect to the actual rule of law? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't know what the prosecution will be like [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=89.26s)]
*  because obviously we've got judges out there [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  that are weaponizing the judicial system as well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=94.14s)]
*  But yes, I believe that we will press charges against everybody [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  that has broken a law last night, and we should do that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=100.48s)]
*  And we'll continue to do our ICE operations. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  We'll continue to make sure everybody in this country [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=105.54s)]
*  has a law equally applied to them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=108.38s)]
*  And these leaders, I don't think we need to make examples out of them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  I think we need to make examples out of criminals. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=114.14s)]
*  And if the leaders are criminals, then they need to face the consequences too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=116.14s)]
*  That's just the way this country works, and that's how freedom works. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=119.8s)]
*  Freedom works when everybody has justice applied equally to them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  So speaking of enforcing the law, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=127.72s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been returned to the United States [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  to face criminal charges for trafficking illegal immigrants into the U.S. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  after Democrats hailed him as a hero. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=136.46s)]
*  You know, it really is kind of amazing when you look at those images [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=139.02s)]
*  that we're watching from L.A., and then you think about this guy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=141.78s)]
*  who has now been charged with human trafficking, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=146.02s)]
*  involving including children. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=148.66s)]
*  You know, I can't help but look at all of it through the lens of politics. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=153.3s)]
*  It's so bad for, I don't know how Democrats, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=157.82s)]
*  how they get out of this situation [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=162.22s)]
*  where they're defending this lawlessness, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=164.42s)]
*  and in particular, defending a guy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=166.66s)]
*  who has been charged with human trafficking of children. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=169.33999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't that he just did it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=174.22s)]
*  It's that a grand jury said it was his full-time job. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=176.38s)]
*  The guy spent his life trafficking people and children [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=180.42s)]
*  and selling them into slavery. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=183.94s)]
*  So he's back. He's getting prosecuted. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=186.1s)]
*  Then he'll be returning back to El Salvador. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=189.17999999999998s)]
*  But the fact that we had Democrat politicians [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  and Van Hollen down there defending him and standing beside him, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=194.61999999999998s)]
*  buying him margaritas when this guy trafficked children for a living [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  and did it as his full-time job is just, it shouldn't be shocking. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=201.82s)]
*  It still is shocking to me that we have people like this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  that go so far out on a limb just to be a big frickin' deal [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=209.94s)]
*  in a political arena where they think that that actually works. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=213.38s)]
*  It doesn't work. It's not going to work anymore. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=216.06s)]
*  The American people are sick of it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=217.78s)]
*  But, you know, Secretary, now you look at the defence of this guy, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  even going to El Salvador, a couple of politicians, why? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=222.82s)]
*  Why are they doubling down on protecting this illegal immigrant [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=225.78s)]
*  involved with so many horrific things? Why? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=229.26s)]
*  Yeah, I had this conversation with Van Hollen and committee [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=232.33999999999997s)]
*  and he couldn't defend himself. He couldn't defend himself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  He kept saying, oh, you didn't give him judicial process. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  You didn't give him the right to have due process. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=240.06s)]
*  Absolutely we did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=242.77999999999997s)]
*  And you went down there anyways and went down there [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=244.38s)]
*  and stood beside someone who's a wife-beater, a human trafficker, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  and said that you support that guy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  I said, when's the last time you did that for one of your constituents, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  one of the people who live in your state and actually need your help? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=255.22s)]
*  When's the last time you fought that hard for those individuals? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=259.02s)]
*  Instead, because you thought it was political and it would work for you, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=262.02s)]
*  you went and stood by a criminal, a guy who has abused children [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=265.82s)]
*  his entire life. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=268.98s)]
*  So I just, the more we educate the American public [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=269.98s)]
*  on what these Democrats are doing, the more they realize [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=273.09999999999997s)]
*  they've just abandoned this country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=275.98s)]
*  Last night they were burning American flags in the streets in L.A. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=277.38s)]
*  And the leaders in L.A. let that happen. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=280.9s)]
*  They were taking American flags and lighting them on fire. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=282.7s)]
*  Those are not people who love America and people who want justice for everybody. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=285.14s)]
*  Those are people who are trying to perpetuate violence to promote an agenda. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=289.74s)]
*  And I saw this in 2020 all across this country [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=293.14s)]
*  where they used fear to control people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=296.38s)]
*  And that's what Democrats are doing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=298.7s)]
*  They're trying to use fear to control people. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=300.74s)]
*  And our law enforcement officers, every day when they go to work, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  they're concerned about losing their lives. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=306.06s)]
*  And their moms and children and wives are worried about losing their family members. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=308.06s)]
*  And it's not right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=312.62s)]
*  So with fact, we have a president that's in the White House [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=314.1s)]
*  that's going to make sure that this isn't going to go on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=316.5s)]
*  Every single person that throws a rock or a bottle where we have jurisdiction, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=319.74s)]
*  they're going to get arrested. They just are. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=323.1s)]
*  Every single weapon assault, anytime you write something like, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=325.42s)]
*  kill ICE, you are going to be prosecuted to the fullest extent [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=328.18s)]
*  that we have the ability to do that and bring consequences down. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  And they're obviously also trying to slow down, halt deportations. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=335.06s)]
*  Now, Brego Garcia, if he's convicted, he'll serve his time [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=341.5s)]
*  and then he'll be deported. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=344.98s)]
*  Is there any world in which what's happening now on the streets of places [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=346.62s)]
*  like L.A. slows down in any way the deportations [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=350.62s)]
*  that the Trump administration is pursuing? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=354.94s)]
*  What's it they're trying to do? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=358.1s)]
*  They're trying to slow us down and scare people and officers [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=359.1s)]
*  from doing their jobs. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=362.18s)]
*  And they're trying to use the judicial courts, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=363.14s)]
*  ones that they think are more friendly or activists, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=365.82s)]
*  to slow us down from being able to do the job [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=368.06s)]
*  that the American people want us to do. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=370.26s)]
*  We're going to do things right. We're going to run our cases, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=372.26s)]
*  make sure that everybody is afforded the ability [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzeGufsl-zw&t=375.22s)]
