# Elon Musk reveals why he had to support Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw)
*  Well, you're getting a new city in the great state of Texas. We love new cities in Texas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=0.0s)]
*  So space SpaceX could have been California if he didn't pick up [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=4.88s)]
*  Taxing him out of the state space X. You're exactly right. They were [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=9.4s)]
*  Initially in California, but they moved into the state of Texas [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=14.92s)]
*  Elon must move to the state of Texas because of the taxes and all that they got a big tax break with the governor of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=17.48s)]
*  Texas Greg Abbott, so they decided to bring SpaceX to the state of Texas [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=24.72s)]
*  Well now they have lost it as a city in the state of Texas. Yeah, the city's called starbase Brian [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=28.64s)]
*  Yeah, so this is they want to keep everybody tight. They said, you know, we're basically in this area [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=34.44s)]
*  Anyway, we want to lure the best of the best [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=40.0s)]
*  So why don't we tell people we have a city around where you work? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=41.92s)]
*  It almost reminds me of what we want when I'm watching Oppenheimer when you're trying to get into intensity [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=44.72s)]
*  And what bring them to bring the family atmosphere to something that's going to get us to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=51.56s)]
*  To to break ice on inventions and imagination you bring everyone together so to me it's a win-win [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, because most of the people who live there they work for the company. They work for Elon [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  They're developing a rocket to land on Mars [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=68.16s)]
*  And so they decided on Saturday at 8 p.m [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=70.68s)]
*  To vote on whether or not to incorporate the town and call it starbase [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=74.08s)]
*  And so they they passed a 97% said they didn't want it to become a town [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=77.6s)]
*  For those that think this is just like a special favor to Elon, this is not the case every place in Texas likes their independence [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=83.0s)]
*  So you have a lot of towns and a lot of cities. They'll break off. They don't want to be a part of the county [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=90.92s)]
*  They don't want to be a part. They want their own independence [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=96.16s)]
*  and so if you have the amount of votes if you have the amount of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Population that supports you you can become your own city [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  You see it happen all the time first time I've seen that building that big black building with the X on it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=105.6s)]
*  It's massive thousands of people are employed by Elon in this town. Yep [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=109.92s)]
*  Laura Trump had a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=114.52s)]
*  Exclusive interview with Elon Musk as well as some of the people from the SpaceX team. Here's a little bit of it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=115.92s)]
*  Do you regret doing what you've been doing? Do you regret coming out and supporting president? Yeah snow? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=121.6s)]
*  No, I I think was essential for president Trump to win to ensure that America [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=131.92s)]
*  remained [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=139.68s)]
*  Great that and that we reached greater heights [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=141.44s)]
*  Really some very basic things need to happen. We need to have obviously a secure border [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=144.56s)]
*  We'd have safe cities. We'd have sensible spending. I think [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=150.88s)]
*  if [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  President Trump had not won I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=157.36s)]
*  think the Democrat campaign to import a vast numbers of illegal voters would have succeeded and it would have naturalized a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=160.16s)]
*  vast numbers of illegals during the sort of communist regime and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=167.96s)]
*  They would have turned America into a one-party state from which we could never escape [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=174.2s)]
*  So as he went on to say that you one of the reasons like why did you come to the Trump camp? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=178.68s)]
*  And it really goes back to when he realized there were so many people on the right who were being [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=183.0s)]
*  Deep platforms including president Trump. He bought X and we know the back-and-forth with that was it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=188.32s)]
*  It's all in a Walter Isis in his book [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=193.28s)]
*  But when he gets it and he's revealed who was going on behind the scenes when he brings in Matt Taibbi and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=195.42s)]
*  and the others [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=203.2s)]
*  Michael Schellenberger and they start revealing all the biases and all the refreshing and all the shadow banning that was taking place it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  Reinforced to him and by the way how he was simply [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=213.04s)]
*  X'd out of the so-called [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=217.48s)]
*  The the left-wing community because he started exposing some of the bias that was taking place [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=220.16s)]
*  Then he realized how bad this could be if Joe Biden or the Democratic Party won again [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=225.76s)]
*  Because not only would they come after him. They're gonna go start locking down the media and the press again. I [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=230.88s)]
*  Think it goes back to what you talk about Ainsley a lot common sense [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people were his story is really not that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=240.16s)]
*  Unique in the sense of of course, he's a famous guy. He's the world's most wealthy person [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=245.32s)]
*  but a lot of people who were Democrats just said it went too far and they weren't focused on the things that matter to the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=251.52s)]
*  American people and now there's been a realignment right now and it just doesn't seem like the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=258.12s)]
*  Democrats are changing the message [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=263.44s)]
*  Well, the jobs report came out at the end of the week on Friday and we have added a hundred and seventy seven thousand jobs [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=265.4s)]
*  That was unexpected. That's exactly what Doge was trying to do that was for the month of April [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=271.52s)]
*  It was a very strong report and the federal jobs fell nine thousand [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=277.17999999999995s)]
*  So what happens according to this editorial board? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  Article in the New York Post it says in other words is exactly what should be happening [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  They wrote US employers added 177 thousand jobs in April in a surprisingly strong report labor force [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  Participation rose even as federal jobs plummeted by nine thousand that fed jobs figure is down [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=296.32s)]
*  26,000 in total since January in other words, this is exactly what should be happening [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=303.32s)]
*  For example US job gains should be fueled by private sector growth [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  Not by adding ever more padding to Uncle Sam's payroll, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  So if it was these guys are cut they lost their jobs. Look how bad the job numbers are gonna be [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=317.68s)]
*  Why are they getting better because these people are leaving their jobs maybe with payouts and they're getting private sector positions [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. We're up to 2.7 million [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  Federal workers they've cut in two hundred and fifty thousand I think so far and they in April alone [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=331.16s)]
*  They have said that number at nine thousand. So they're finding other jobs with the width with that in their resume [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Also, I understand states are recruiting the federal workers because they need them because a lot of the states need to hire people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  And we got to take this in into context we're only a little over a hundred days [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=348.36s)]
*  So just imagine when we get a first year of this administration and the realignment of our federal government [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  Some of these jobs are redundant some of these jobs [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=360.36s)]
*  We don't even need some of them are a part of waste fraud and abuse. So there's gonna be an entire [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=362.96s)]
*  They haven't even made it through every single department every single cabinet. Sure. They've assigned some people but you get there [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=369.28s)]
*  They're fighting the federal government [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=375.78s)]
*  I'm sorry the federal courts right now when it comes to some of these employment some of these people they have to rehire back [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=377.18s)]
*  When they finally do get all the waste and and fraud and abuse out of our government [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=382.42s)]
*  I think the numbers are gonna be higher in the private sector plus and with the tariffs you have more Americans that are getting loans [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=387.5s)]
*  They're they're passing legislation so that you can get more capital to build your company then that's also gonna encourage [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=393.14s)]
*  More hiring because these new American companies will need workers, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=399.86s)]
*  He did say I thought we'd be able to save a little bit more money [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=403.66s)]
*  Then the hundred I think what he said 250 billion or 150 billion dollars 60 [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=406.82000000000005s)]
*  Which I think is good [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  But I think what's underappreciated even by him is the systems and accountability and the modernization that's taking place [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=413.22s)]
*  Which he's so he left his team behind [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=419.54s)]
*  That's gonna be taking place whether it's human resources whether it's record-keeping whether it's stopping future fraud down the line [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I don't know if that's quantifiable where you can actually use the numbers that he gave you in order to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=429.14s)]
*  hand it over to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=435.78s)]
*  The office and management of budget to say okay. This is my budget. This is a big beautiful bill [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=437.94s)]
*  This is the money we saved and now figured into the money. We got to spend on places like defense. This is exactly right [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPAUpWfVrw&t=442.82s)]
