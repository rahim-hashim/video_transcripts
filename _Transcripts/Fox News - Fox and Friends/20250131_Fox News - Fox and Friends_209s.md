# Ainsley Earhardt: This is unacceptable
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs)
*  We have a Fox News alert. Two black boxes containing crucial recordings have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=0.0s)]
*  recovered from the American Airlines flight that crashed in DC. And new imaging shows their close [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  altitudes right before their collision near the Reagan National Airport. As new reports say, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=10.64s)]
*  one air traffic controller was working two positions at the time of the crash. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Troy Nels just talked with the National Transportation Safety Board [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  about their investigation and joins us now. Good morning to you, Congressman. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=24.64s)]
*  Good morning. Good morning. What did the NTSB say? Why was there one person handling two jobs [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=28.24s)]
*  and risking all of these lives? Well, that's a very good question. Reports are out there that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  the DCA, which is the Reagan Airport where this took place, their air traffic control staffing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=41.28s)]
*  shows that they need 30 personnel to operate that air traffic control tower. It's a very busy airport. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=47.28s)]
*  They say there are about 19 currently on staff. So we have a staffing issue at the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=54.64s)]
*  Reagan Airport, DCA, and it must be addressed. And I don't like the reports that are saying that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=59.84s)]
*  this air traffic controller was not only monitoring the helicopters, they were also [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=67.6s)]
*  monitoring the aircraft coming in. And those duties should have been shared. It should have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=74.08s)]
*  been a shared responsibility, but maybe because of the staffing issue, they weren't able to do so. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=78.64s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we get on a plane and we just trust that whoever's in that tower [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=83.52s)]
*  knows how to do their job and that they're arrested. But the New York Times says [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=88.16s)]
*  it's employee turnover, it's tight budgets. Some of them are working up to six days per week, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=91.92s)]
*  10-hour days. This is unacceptable. We don't know, we don't see inside the towers. We just trust [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=97.84s)]
*  the NTSB or the federal government to make sure their staff are the best of the best. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=103.52s)]
*  What can we do to change this? Well, I think there needs to be some oversight from Congress. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=107.36s)]
*  We need to make sure that if these airports are struggling with air traffic controllers, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=112.48s)]
*  they bring it to our attention and we can try to encourage more younger people to get into that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=118.08s)]
*  field. As you stated, it is a very stressful job. But I have to say, when you look at our [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  aviation record, our safety record over the past 15 years, I mean, in 2009, obviously, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=128.56s)]
*  we had the Colgan Air crash and killed 47 people, but we haven't had a major incident in the United [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=134.88s)]
*  States in the past 15 years. Your viewers have to understand 45,000 flights each and every day out [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=140.4s)]
*  of the United States. And we haven't had a major incident in 15 years. DCA, very busy airport. We [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=146.24s)]
*  have 800 flights inbound and outbound each and every day at Reagan Airport. And overall, I believe [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=152.72s)]
*  our record, our safety record is the gold standard. But when we have an issue like this, it needs to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=159.52s)]
*  be addressed. And I believe the NTSB will conduct a very thorough investigation and they'll come up [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=165.04s)]
*  with some recommendations to make sure that we can mitigate risk and something like this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=171.68s)]
*  never takes place again. And maybe Donald Trump getting rid of DEI in these agencies will also [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=176.16s)]
*  help because there's a lawsuit from last year where a thousand people were turned away because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=181.92s)]
*  of race who were applying for those positions as control tower agents and they were turned away [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  because of race. So hopefully we'll clean up the system and the government. Thank you so much, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=192.0s)]
*  Congressman. Thanks for working hard and hopefully we can fix this ace out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZpzieBZkKs&t=196.0s)]
