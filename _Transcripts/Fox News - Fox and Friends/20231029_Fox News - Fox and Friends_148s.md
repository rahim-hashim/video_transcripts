# Shalva Center helps evacuated people in need
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE)
*  The Shalva Center in Jerusalem offers around-the-clock care to over a thousand disabled children, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=0.0s)]
*  and both patients and staff have lost loved ones in the war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=6.9s)]
*  Now the IDF has designated it a National Emergency Response Center. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=10.82s)]
*  Joining us now is the Chief Development Officer, Gabi Hirsch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=15.56s)]
*  Gabi, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=18.5s)]
*  This is really a renowned, world-renowned center for children with disabilities. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=20.26s)]
*  Tell us what you do and how that mission has changed in light of what's happened in Israel [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=29.7s)]
*  So on a typical day here at Shalva, we would have anywhere between, really typically up to about a thousand children, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  babies, children and adults all coming to our center from across Israel's demographic, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=39.1s)]
*  coming from programs that see all the way through birth, adulthood, including employment and independent living. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=45.2s)]
*  As soon as we had the outbreak of war, Shalva opened its doors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=50.4s)]
*  As you mentioned, we're a designated National Crisis Response Center, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=54.3s)]
*  and immediately started to bring in people who had been evacuated from the southern border. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=58.3s)]
*  So already the day after the outbreak of war, we had hundreds of families who had come to stay in a neighboring hotel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=62.8s)]
*  We opened our doors to the center and they've been using our center all day every day for the entire families coming. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=70.5s)]
*  We've set up a temporary school here for them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=77.0s)]
*  In addition to that, we have a group of teenage youth at risk girls who again, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=79.6s)]
*  their center was in one of those neighboring villages. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=84.6s)]
*  Their center is now actually within a military zone and they're not able to go back there for the foreseeable future. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=88.69999999999999s)]
*  So a hundred teenage youth at risk girls are here at Shalva. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  This is now effectively their home. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=97.5s)]
*  What you're seeing on screen now are therapy sessions. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=100.6s)]
*  We've opened both for the children and of course for their parents of those who've been evacuated. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=103.5s)]
*  Alongside that, as the evacuation process continues and more and more people are evacuated, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=109.6s)]
*  potentially now also from the northern borders of the country, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=114.4s)]
*  we are now getting ready to take up to a thousand additional evacuees here at Shalva. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=118.0s)]
*  Well, Gabby, it is an amazing center. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=123.7s)]
*  I just saw the images. It's beautiful. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  We know that disruption of services is especially hard for children with disabilities. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=127.7s)]
*  We thank you for all that you're doing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=133.0s)]
*  We thank you very much. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=134.8s)]
*  Got it. Thank you, Gabby. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=136.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=137.6s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9lASNlOHBE&t=138.5s)]
