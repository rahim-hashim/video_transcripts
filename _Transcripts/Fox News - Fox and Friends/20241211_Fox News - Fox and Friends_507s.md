# Daniel Penny: I couldn't 'live with myself' if Jordan Neely had hurt someone
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c)
*  The guilt I would have felt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=0.0s)]
*  If someone did get hurt if if he did do what he was threatening [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=2.44s)]
*  to do would never be able to live with myself. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  And I'll I'll take a million. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=11.58s)]
*  Court appearances and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=15.34s)]
*  people calling me names and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=18.28s)]
*  people hating me just to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=20.88s)]
*  keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=25.02s)]
*  Daniel Penney speaking exclusively to Fox for the first time since being cleared of all charges. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=27.3s)]
*  This as his defense team tells us they're considering filing their own lawsuit for malicious persecution. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=34.64s)]
*  Good for them. Yeah. No kidding. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=41.18s)]
*  Let's talk to Daniel Penny's attorney Stephen Raser joins us right now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=42.92s)]
*  Stephen congratulations. Good morning to you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. Good morning to you as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=49.88s)]
*  So we saw you yesterday. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=52.02s)]
*  We were running the video of you and Danny and another attorney at the Stone Street Tavern after his acquittal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  I know you've got the attorney client privilege but what. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Tell us what you guys were talking about. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=64.9s)]
*  I mean is there one thing that he said to you that you thought wow that's cool. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=66.84s)]
*  Well the relief he felt and that other attorney by the way is Thomas Kniff [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=75.18s)]
*  partner Raser Kniff and you know Danny for us became more than just a case. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=80.89999999999999s)]
*  So we're trying to take care of Danny and make sure that he's treated fairly in a system that was geared to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=87.14s)]
*  prosecute him maliciously in a manner which was not supported by the evidence. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=94.08s)]
*  And there was other motivations at play here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=100.12s)]
*  So Danny saying that he's relieved. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=102.82s)]
*  That was the best thing that I could ever hear because the amount of stress that he's been under for the past year and a half has been tremendous. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  You know Stephen you're correct. It was a malicious prosecution. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=111.72s)]
*  But I got to ask you about this lawsuit that you all may go against him with because at one point when they tried to get some consolation [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=115.66s)]
*  charge against Daniel the jury struck it down. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=124.85999999999999s)]
*  But the judge agreed with you that it wasn't really the right process to go by but still allowed it to happen. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=127.94s)]
*  Yeah well he did. I mean he actually made sure it happened. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=136.32s)]
*  So for whatever reason you know so I can't get into the mind of the judge right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=141.32s)]
*  But what I do know is that it was based on the application of the district attorney's office. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=145.32s)]
*  And just like Danny said in his interview it was like they wanted to try and get him on something. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=150.32s)]
*  They knew they weren't going to be able to get him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=155.32s)]
*  So they had to get rid of that top count in order to get to that second count just in the hopes that maybe they could pull out a win here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=157.32s)]
*  And they were unsuccessful. Thank God. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=164.32s)]
*  You know I think the difficult thing for me I look at that I think about his family. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=167.32s)]
*  I'm a mom. I think about his mom his sisters. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=171.32s)]
*  So this happens. He's acquitted. He's he's free. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=175.32s)]
*  But now there's other lawsuits the one from Jordan Neely's father who suddenly appeared out of the woodwork. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=179.32s)]
*  But you're now considering contemplate or you're contemplating this malicious prosecution. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=186.32s)]
*  How does this work. Who who exactly are you going. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=192.32s)]
*  Is this against Alvin Bragg. Who does this actually go against. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=194.32s)]
*  Well it goes against Alvin Bragg for the way in which he handled this case and the anyone else ethical lines that were blurred. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=200.32s)]
*  Yeah I mean the medical examiner's office. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=208.32s)]
*  So you Graham for his involvement in this case I mean the record was made fairly clear as to the extent of his involvement in what occurred here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=210.32s)]
*  You know he was appointed by Mayor Adams same political party as as Alvin Bragg. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=220.32s)]
*  There was collusion there. And I mean the collusion began from the very beginning of this case and all the way through the district attorney needed the medical examiner and needed the medical examiner to act quickly. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=226.32s)]
*  And he did just that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=238.32s)]
*  So first off how concerned were you after Donald Trump got convicted by this New York jury in a case that no one thought had validity to including a lot of Democrats. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=240.32s)]
*  What were you thinking knowing that you had a case coming up right right after that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=254.32s)]
*  Yeah so that's a you know it's a great point because to be honest with you it was scary. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=260.32s)]
*  And for us from a defense perspective we honed in on the most important part of the case was going to be jury selection because that was going to be the biggest challenge is to get a fair jury. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=265.32s)]
*  And you know from all everything that we did and all the steps we took and the advisors that we put in place it worked out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=276.32s)]
*  It really did. But it was close and it was difficult. So that was where the key battle was was was waged. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=284.32s)]
*  But counselor you know people look at you as a criminal defense attorney but you were in the prosecutor's office before this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=292.32s)]
*  How do you feel about the system being the way it is. I mean when you are a prosecutor this is not what this is not the type of stuff y'all went after. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=299.32s)]
*  They are allowing the criminals to roam the streets and the civilians that protect the citizens are now the criminals. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=308.32s)]
*  How do you feel about this system. Well that's just it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=315.32s)]
*  I mean and there was some highlights that were put out there quite extensively in regards to this office's practice and not prosecuting crime and some very serious cases to talking about restorative justice and such. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=320.32s)]
*  Which by the way in some circumstances that's that's a great thing and it can be but some brutal cases of of an individual who attacked an 80 year old man mugging him and punching him and ultimately killing him. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=334.32s)]
*  And yet you're going to go after full throated against my client who you admit it did a laudable thing and is a fine young man despicable. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=346.32s)]
*  Sure. Steven you in talking about how a couple of moments ago in talking about how you may file these lawsuits against Alvin Bragg medical examiner you had said there were motivations involved. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=355.32s)]
*  What were the motivations that those offices did that would in your estimation break the law. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=370.32s)]
*  Well listen it's not necessarily even about breaking the law it's blurring ethical boundaries and failing to to act in the manner in which you are expected because of your office. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=379.32s)]
*  But the bottom line is a lot of this came out at trial too and it was clear that there was a fear that if an arrest wasn't made and made very quickly that there might be rioting in the streets and that that may ultimately look very bad for district attorney Alvin Bragg. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=391.32s)]
*  And if that in fact happened that could affect his reelection. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=408.32s)]
*  Now let's keep in mind we know this is a Democrat stronghold right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=412.32s)]
*  But don't forget Alvin Bragg has the consideration of the primary. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=415.32s)]
*  So if he doesn't keep his base happy he could get primaried and that's where he's wrong. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=419.32s)]
*  He should be real quick. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=423.32s)]
*  Danny Penny the person that you started to represent a year and a half ago and the Danny Penny now who's been screamed at because the murderer. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=425.32s)]
*  You could hear the chants in the courtroom every day. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=431.32s)]
*  How has he changed. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=435.32s)]
*  Well look he's scarred from this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=439.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=441.32s)]
*  I mean it's great. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=442.32s)]
*  We had a great resolution. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=443.32s)]
*  But as you know there's already a lawsuit filed against him and you know the timing of it is somewhat suspect as far as the coordination between the district attorney's office and the family attorneys. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=444.32s)]
*  So Danny will be forever changed. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=453.32s)]
*  He will always have that fear because they wanted to instill fear right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=456.32s)]
*  So I'll heighten the alertness let's say right. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=460.32s)]
*  So Danny's a strong guy and he's going to continue with his life. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=463.32s)]
*  He's going to pursue his degree and he's going to have a great great career. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=465.32s)]
*  But he'll be forever changed. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=469.32s)]
*  And unfortunately there's nothing you can do about that other than to pursue these causes of action defend them against any slanderous attempts to yes to hurt him in the future. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=471.32s)]
*  Well you won for him and he worked so hard it was extremely personal for you and your partner to get him in this victory and defend him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=482.32s)]
*  So great job. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=489.32s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=490.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLOA3VRue6c&t=491.32s)]
