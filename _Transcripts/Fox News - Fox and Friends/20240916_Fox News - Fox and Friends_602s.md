# Speaker Johnson meets with Trump after 2nd assassination attempt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk)
*  Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson posting this photo from Mar-a-Lago yesterday where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=0.0s)]
*  he visited with Donald Trump right after the second assassination attempt at his golf course [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  nearby. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=9.56s)]
*  Speaker Johnson joins us now to react. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=10.56s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, did you think maybe your meeting was going to be canceled when you heard about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=12.4s)]
*  the shooting? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=15.8s)]
*  And what demeanor would you, how would you describe the president when he got to him? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=16.8s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Brian. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=20.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=22.56s)]
*  My wife Kelly and I were on the way to Mar-a-Lago when the shooting occurred, and so we were [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=23.56s)]
*  delayed a little bit because they shut down all the traffic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=28.4s)]
*  But then we arrived there about the time that President Trump did. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=31.4s)]
*  We spent about three hours with him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=35.0s)]
*  He was in very good spirits, as you might expect. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=37.24s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=39.92s)]
*  He's so resilient, and we were really grateful to see him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=40.92s)]
*  You know, I said this, and we'll all be talking about this for quite some time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=43.28s)]
*  There's no leader in the history of America that has been so attacked and has remained [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  so strong and so resilient. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  He's one of a kind. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=53.04s)]
*  He is not going to stop fighting for the American people, and it was really encouraging for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=54.04s)]
*  us to sit and visit with him right after that happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=57.6s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I know your faith is very important to you, and after the first assassination [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  attempt, what was it, 65 days ago? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=63.92s)]
*  Donald Trump said it was providential, that he happened to turn his head at the right [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=66.0s)]
*  moment and look at that board, which normally he plays at the end of his rallies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=69.2s)]
*  But he said he felt like God was with him during that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=74.72s)]
*  Was he mentioning anything like that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=77.64s)]
*  I mean, this is the second time someone has tried to take his life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=79.0s)]
*  That has to be pretty jarring. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=82.28s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  It's a remarkable thing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  I spoke with him at great length about that because it is something that no one can deny. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=87.92s)]
*  God has spared his life twice now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  I told him that it reminded me of the bulletproof George Washington, our first president, who [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  evaded being shot when he was an Army colonel, the famous incident in the French-Indian War, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=99.52s)]
*  where they all took shots at him and bullet holes went through his jacket and it didn't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=106.24s)]
*  take him down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  That event took place, ironically, less than 50 miles from where President Trump was shot [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  on the stage at Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=114.64s)]
*  These things aren't accidents. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  It's not luck. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  I believe it's providence and we talked about that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  It's a remarkable thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  It would move any man's heart. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  I think it's moved the president's and it's just something he's processing right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=127.96s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting, you know, because he is not just the nominee for the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  Republican Party, but also a former president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=134.68s)]
*  The reality is former presidents don't have the same kind of security bubble that current [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=137.84s)]
*  presidents do. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, Jimmy Carter, you've got to figure he does not have as big a bubble as the current [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  president nor does Barack Obama. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  They've got protection. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  But nonetheless, he is the nominee. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  He is a former president. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  He is in need of more security. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  He is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=161.18s)]
*  That's very well said. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=162.18s)]
*  And, you know, you saw him compliment online yesterday the Secret Service that are protecting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=163.18s)]
*  him now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=168.02s)]
*  I got a briefing from the acting director of the Secret Service, Ron Rowe, within 90 [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=169.22s)]
*  minutes of the event. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=174.06s)]
*  I was actually sitting with President Trump when he called. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=175.18s)]
*  We listened to that in detail. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=178.66s)]
*  And what I understand happened is that those agents that were with him yesterday saw that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=180.94s)]
*  barrel of that gun between the bushes on a golf course. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=187.78s)]
*  I mean, you know, that's a difficult thing to spot. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=190.86s)]
*  Thankfully, they did. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=192.98s)]
*  But unlike in Butler, they did not pause. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=194.34s)]
*  They immediately pulled their weapons and fired. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=196.98s)]
*  I think that's why this guy, the suspect, the shooter, threw the gun in the bushes and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  ran. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=206.42s)]
*  Had they not been there, had they not acted so quickly and so decisively, we might be [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  having a different conversation today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  President Trump needs the most coverage of anyone. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  He's the most attacked. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  He's the most threatened, even probably more than when he was in the Oval Office. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  in the House that he have every asset available and we will make more available if necessary. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=223.22s)]
*  I don't think it's a funding issue. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=228.46s)]
*  I think it's a manpower allocation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=230.06s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=231.98s)]
*  Number one, Lindsey Graham brought up yesterday, it's time to spin off the Secret Service where [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=232.98s)]
*  it was. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=237.38s)]
*  Back to Treasury, got more attention, was able to focus. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=238.38s)]
*  It's swallowed up by home and security. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=241.3s)]
*  Number two, to get to the higher levels of Secret Service into college education. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=243.7s)]
*  We got Navy SEALs coming back at 31 years old who are ready to go and they're out of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=247.86s)]
*  the military and yet if they don't have that college degree, they're not able to guard [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=252.86s)]
*  the present. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=256.98s)]
*  Can we make some adjustments into the people that can get into those ranks? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=257.98s)]
*  Brian, desperate times call for desperate measures. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  We will look at all those things. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=264.74s)]
*  As you know, I put together a task force in the immediate wake of the Butler, Pennsylvania, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=266.54s)]
*  the shocking failures, lapses in security there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=270.86s)]
*  coming up this month for that task force and of course the Senate has its own Homeland [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=275.62s)]
*  Security Committee looking into it as well. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  There's going to be reports and recommendations coming forward and Congress will act swiftly. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=284.06s)]
*  We need accountability. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=288.02s)]
*  We must demand that this job is being done. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=289.4s)]
*  I think there are some really patriotic, great people working in the Secret Service, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=291.54s)]
*  it's the leadership. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=297.26s)]
*  We have no faith, I have no faith in Secretary Mayorkas, Department of Homeland Security. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=298.26s)]
*  We impeached him in the House, as you know, but Chuck Schumer made it die in the Senate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=303.38s)]
*  So we've got to get accountability. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=307.78s)]
*  We're working on it every day and President Trump deserves every measure of that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=309.58s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, what's the latest for Pennsylvania State Police? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=313.14s)]
*  I know that today's the deadline for them to produce these records and updates about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  that assassination attempt 65 days ago in Butler. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=320.3s)]
*  What's the latest? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=324.54s)]
*  Are they working with you? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=325.54s)]
*  Are they cooperating? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=326.54s)]
*  What do you expect? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=327.54s)]
*  They are. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  We expect them to turn over the evidence. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  I'll be shocked if they don't and we'll take appropriate action. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=331.22s)]
*  But it takes some time to do a deliberate investigation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=333.94s)]
*  There will be hearings, I think, not this week but next in our task force and a report [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=338.54s)]
*  due by the end of that same week. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=343.74s)]
*  And so more and more of these answers will be coming out. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=346.1s)]
*  The final report due shortly thereafter. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=348.18s)]
*  So good work is being done. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=350.3s)]
*  There's some extraordinary members of Congress working on it around the clock and we have [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=352.1s)]
*  to do that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=355.5s)]
*  It's the top priority, a top priority for the American people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=356.5s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=359.1s)]
*  We were just speaking to one of the task force members. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  They're going to ask for a briefing on what happened yesterday in West Palm Beach as soon [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  as 9 o'clock when they can do that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=367.26000000000005s)]
*  One of the things, Mr. Speaker, going forward though is that as this investigation has been [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=370.62s)]
*  handed over to the FBI, it sounds like the locals are going to press charges just to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=377.42s)]
*  hold the guy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  But Ron DeSantis, the governor of the great state of Florida, came out yesterday and he [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=383.1s)]
*  said, people need to know the truth. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=386.86s)]
*  So we're going to do our own investigation because he wants to know how did this guy [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=389.3s)]
*  get within 500 yards of the former president and the current nominee? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=394.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you think that's a good idea? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=399.1s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  We all need to investigate it, local, state, feds, you know, whatever's necessary. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  Look, I think what happened is on a golf course, it's a lot of area to cover. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  From what I understand and what President Trump understands, they were ahead of him [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=411.86s)]
*  two holes. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  There were drones being used over the course. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=416.46000000000004s)]
*  That was not the case in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=419.12s)]
*  I mean, obviously some improvements are being made. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=420.72s)]
*  And thankfully they were at least two holes ahead and they spotted that barrel through [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=424.24s)]
*  the bushes, which is a remarkable thing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=427.56s)]
*  Again, I think it's providential. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  But that's what happened. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=431.2s)]
*  We'll be looking into all the details of it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=432.76s)]
*  Look, we got the Secret Service's attention. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=435.16s)]
*  I think they're devoting every asset, but we're going to make absolutely sure that's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=438.56s)]
*  true. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=442.04s)]
*  Lastly, separate note. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=443.04s)]
*  We know the Democrats have outraged you, especially since Vice President Harris got [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=445.04s)]
*  the nomination. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=449.20000000000005s)]
*  And they say, well, you know, Trump could overcome that, but down-ballot's going to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  pay the price. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=453.72s)]
*  You've got 30 seats up for contention. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=454.72s)]
*  We watched Congressman Gonzalez over the weekend, or last weekend, come out and say, I think [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  we're going to lose the House. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=460.68s)]
*  Where is the race? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  Don't buy it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=464.36s)]
*  We're doing very well. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=465.36s)]
*  I'm very bullish about November. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  I've been traveling the country nonstop so far. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=468.04s)]
*  I've done campaign events in over 204 cities and 40 states now. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=470.16s)]
*  I can hardly keep track. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  But everywhere we go, there's an energy on the ground. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=475.64s)]
*  We are going to win the House and the Senate, and Donald Trump is going back to the White [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=478.0s)]
*  House. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  But we need everybody to stay involved. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  We got to make it too big to rig, as President Trump says. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=484.2s)]
*  He and I talked about that at length yesterday as well. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=486.72s)]
*  We're very bullish. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=489.6s)]
*  I'm convinced we're going to grow the House majority, the Senate. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=490.6s)]
*  It will come back to our control. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=492.64s)]
*  And President Trump's getting another term. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=495.12s)]
*  And we'll fix this country. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=496.64s)]
*  Is that the point of the Wednesday rally, perhaps, to help some of those contentious [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  seats in New York? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=502.0s)]
*  The president's going to be on Long Island in Uniondale. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  Look, our majority runs through California and New York and a few other key swing districts [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=507.71999999999997s)]
*  around the country. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=512.64s)]
*  So I've spent a lot of time in those states. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=513.64s)]
*  But look, I'm telling you, we're doing very well there. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=515.52s)]
*  We're going to defy expectations. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=518.0s)]
*  This is going to be a good November for us. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=520.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=521.76s)]
*  What about right now? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=522.76s)]
*  Because you guys have got a problem with a budget. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=523.76s)]
*  And a lot of members on your own caucus don't like your idea. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=526.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=531.92s)]
*  Look, we have two primary responsibilities, immediate responsibilities, upon us. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=533.0s)]
*  September 30th is the end of the fiscal year. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=537.5999999999999s)]
*  We have a responsibility to fund the government. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=540.12s)]
*  And we have a responsibility to ensure that the upcoming election is safe, fair, and secure. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=542.26s)]
*  And so I attached the SAVE Act to the CR. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=547.0s)]
*  And we're working through having family conversations about the best route to get all that done. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=550.0s)]
*  I'm optimistic we can do both things. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=554.16s)]
*  We have a duty to do it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=556.36s)]
*  When you say family conversations, what does that mean? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=557.36s)]
*  A bunch of Republicans are in a room yelling at each other. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=560.0s)]
*  Oh no, no, no, no. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=563.2s)]
*  I call it intense fellowship sometimes. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=564.52s)]
*  But it's great. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  Listen, I have the smallest majority in U.S. history for five months. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  I had a one-vote margin. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  We have a four-vote margin now. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=571.84s)]
*  It's an embarrassment of riches. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=573.12s)]
*  We're going to grow that in November. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  But between now and then, you have to build consensus. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  It takes patience. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=580.24s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=581.24s)]
*  But we're up for it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=582.24s)]
*  Yeah, we haven't seen that in a while, consensus. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=583.24s)]
*  We know everyone's very comfortable speaking out against each other in your party. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=585.38s)]
*  Speaker Johnson keeps his cool always. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=589.12s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=590.76s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULIgLMDickk&t=591.76s)]
