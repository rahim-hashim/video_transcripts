# Peter Doocy: Angry Democrats pointing fingers for Harris' loss
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo)
*  And we start here. President Biden is going to address the nation this morning after speaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=0.0s)]
*  with President-elect Donald Trump yesterday on the phone. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=6.0s)]
*  Biden offering Trump a meeting at the White House to ensure a smooth transition as Vice [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=10.0s)]
*  President Harris concedes the election, but not the fight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=14.72s)]
*  Peter Doocy is live at the White House. Hey, Peter, what is the president saying? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=18.88s)]
*  Good morning. Some Democrats are sad about Harris losing. Some Democrats are mad about [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=23.2s)]
*  Harris losing, and they're blaming Joe Biden. So even though he got himself out of the way [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=29.2s)]
*  months before anybody ever voted, a Harris campaign aide is quoted in Politico as saying, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=33.68s)]
*  we ran the best campaign we could considering Joe Biden was president. Grumbled one Harris [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=39.04s)]
*  aide granted anonymity to speak freely. Joe Biden is the singular reason Kamala Harris [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=44.32s)]
*  and Democrats lost. Biden was told privately this summer that he had a 0% chance of beating Trump, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=50.0s)]
*  but after that, Harris got a huge bounce when she joined the ticket, picked Tim Walz and had a glitzy [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=56.16s)]
*  convention. And now campaign staff are getting an email from their boss, General Malley-Dillon, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=63.12s)]
*  that says, I know the vice president isn't finished in this fight. And I know the very [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=67.52s)]
*  people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission. View this as the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=72.24s)]
*  beginning, not the end. That was the gist of the VP's remarks at Howard University yesterday. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  It seemed somewhat hastily organized. An invite was texted to supporters just hours ahead of time, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=82.96s)]
*  and NBC News is reporting the Harris team did not spend much time writing a concession. They thought [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=88.72s)]
*  her initial remarks were just going to be about keeping the faith during a day's long vote count. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=94.32s)]
*  While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign, the fight [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=102.08s)]
*  for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. That is a fight I will [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=110.72s)]
*  never give up. And we don't know how exactly the vice president plans to keep up that fight as a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=120.08s)]
*  private citizen come January. Back to you. Hey, Peter, you mentioned that Donald Trump was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=126.16s)]
*  invited by Joe Biden to go to the White House before the inauguration just to work things out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=132.64s)]
*  Did you see the lead of drudge right now is the conservative publication National Review said [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=138.24s)]
*  they gave some advice to Joe Biden. Joe Biden should pardon Donald Trump of all the pending [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=144.4s)]
*  charges, relieves the special counsel Jack Smith of his duties, and then ask the New York governor [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=150.24s)]
*  to pardon Trump from crimes he was convicted in in New York state. Is there any chance Joe [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Biden could actually pardon Donald Trump? Well, if you listen, if you believe what the president [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=162.48s)]
*  has told us over the last few months, that would introduce the possibility that he could pardon [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump and then not pardon his son and let Hunter go off and rot in jail. And so it's possible, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  but we have no indication that that's going to happen. I asked Biden about that a couple months [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  ago, and he just kind of laughed about it and said, that's a good question. But you know, Peter, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=187.28s)]
*  he could he could pardon Donald Trump and then Donald Trump could pardon his son in January. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=191.76s)]
*  Yeah, or yeah, yes, it is possible. It would be a pardoned Palooza, Peter. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=198.88s)]
*  Yes. Hey, Peter, I have a prediction. You're going to get a sit down with President Biden [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=205.12s)]
*  before he leaves. Oh, that would be great. In the White House. That's my prediction. Would you accept [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=210.56s)]
*  his invitation? Yes, I would accept an invitation to have a one on one interview with the president. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=214.72s)]
*  I'm going to call him right after the show. And it sounds like I could just get like a preemptive [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=220.56s)]
*  pardon because everybody else seems to need one. Just in case. Well, pardon me. From Jay Walking or [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=225.04s)]
*  whatever. But Steve, I don't think he's going to need it. He's never done anything wrong in his life, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=234.24s)]
*  right? No, Peter. Oh, I've got information. I think it's totally unfair, though, of the Democrats [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=238.56s)]
*  to blame Joe Biden for all of this. First of all, you all used him. And then when you all didn't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=245.04s)]
*  need to use him anymore, you all got rid of him. Also, the whole plan of Joe Biden was for him to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=249.12s)]
*  only serve one term. That's what he said during the. But Kamala was so bad. She was so bad. So he [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=255.04s)]
*  could not pass the torch. And as we've seen since this election, why it was so bad. Plus, there was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=260.72s)]
*  pressure on him because they said he's the only one that was able to beat Donald Trump before. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=266.0s)]
*  But I will say this. I think there's that school of thought. Yes. But I also think that he was drunk [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=270.32s)]
*  with success and the midterms. And he thought the heck with this. They could be that we kept the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=276.56s)]
*  Senate and it took him three extra weeks to flip the house, which was supposed to be around. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=282.0s)]
*  So there's no red wave. They like me. They really like me. I'm staying. Just like Leo DiCaprio. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=286.64s)]
*  And other Democrats supported him, too, and to the debate performance. Yeah. But ultimately, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=292.08s)]
*  I think that's true, Brian. I think he probably thought what movie? You remember that movie? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=296.88s)]
*  I remember Titanic with him. Who's the movie? Wolf of Wall Street? Oh, yeah. When he's supposed [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=301.2s)]
*  to resign. And he stood on the. When he's supposed to resign, he said. I'm staying. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=304.96s)]
*  Wave saying, can we roll that clip? Yeah. We'll let him grab it. What did y'all think of the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=307.84s)]
*  concession speech yesterday? Well, it wasn't a concession speech. Essentially, she said, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=313.52s)]
*  I'm not done fighting. But America took a vote on her fight and said, nope, no, thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  What's interesting about as we talk a little bit about the playing game, there are a number of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=324.64s)]
*  stories this morning that the people in Biden world, the people who told Joe Biden that he [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=329.12s)]
*  should stay in it and encouraged him to run a second term, even though he had not achieved the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=335.12s)]
*  stratospheric legacy of FDR, which they told him he would do, is the people around Joe Biden are [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=340.56s)]
*  blaming Nancy Pelosi. And they say he could have won the white working class voters, Harris ceded [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=346.32s)]
*  to Donald Trump and to Joe Biden having essentially Nancy squeeze him out was like when [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  Barack Obama in 2016 said, Joe, sit down. I'm picking what's her name? They should have. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=359.52s)]
*  They should have Clinton instead to run as my successor. They should have looked back and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=365.68s)]
*  remembered that she was the first one that had to drop out of the race when she ran before. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=370.16s)]
*  America did not want her. But it's still not getting her attention. Essentially, the concession [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=374.32s)]
*  speech was the start of the resistance movement. I mean, before he's even been sworn in, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=379.44s)]
*  she's made it very clear, even though the country rejected whatever agenda that the staff wrote, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=386.24s)]
*  because we never heard from her about policy. There was not an economic policy. There was not [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=391.6s)]
*  a border policy. There was all these flip flops that the staff communicated, not her. She still [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=395.92s)]
*  says that we're going to things when you watch the concession speech. First of all, she waited until [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=401.92s)]
*  four o'clock in the afternoon to do it, which I understand if she wants to wait till the next [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=405.52s)]
*  morning, fine. But to wait until the later the next day in the afternoon, I just didn't think [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=408.96s)]
*  that was the right move. And then when you do hear it, she talks about I'm not giving up the fight, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  A. And B, she said, this time it will be an easy transition of power or something like that, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=419.84s)]
*  like throwing it in Trump's face from before. I expected it. I did expect that. But what I thought [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  was I had a great conversation with the former president. I wish him all the best. That would be [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=432.4s)]
*  classic. Do you think there might be a cease and desist, at least for in the short term from all [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=437.28s)]
*  of them? Like you would not be surprised if Donald Trump does an interview tomorrow, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=441.84s)]
*  if he doesn't go out and say she's terrible vice president, he doesn't say, you know, Joe Biden's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=446.64s)]
*  mind is melting down. I think that there might be a cease and desist. And I know so many times [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=451.52s)]
*  President Trump, when when Megan McCain and he was sparring, he would not go back to Megan McCain. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=455.84s)]
*  He said I didn't touch Michelle Obama on purpose. He does hold back from certain people. Well, after [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  the fight is over, he doesn't really bring it back. And he won. And he won. And that's the deal. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=466.0s)]
*  You know how he says it's like a UFC fight. You beat the hell out of each other. Right. There's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=470.72s)]
*  blood everywhere. I know it's more than television. But then after that, you hug it out and you move [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=475.12s)]
*  forward. And I think even when you had Eric Trump that was on last night, when he was asked about [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=480.08s)]
*  the concessions, he wanted to move on. He did not want to talk about Kamala. I think that is the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=485.04s)]
*  viewpoint of the former president. And what you said a moment ago talking about this is the beginning [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=489.28s)]
*  of the resistance against Donald Trump. I think you're right. And that goes back a full circle to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=493.84s)]
*  what I had quoted from the conservative National Review. What they say is, you know, after Joe [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=498.64s)]
*  Biden pardons Donald Trump, Donald Trump deserves to enter the term in January of 2025 with a slight [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=504.23999999999995s)]
*  wipe clean of the controversies of the progressive, the previous era. And it would ultimately be good [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  for Joe Biden's legacy, because then it will make him appear like he is a uniter. Let's go forward. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=516.64s)]
*  It's never going to happen, but it would be classy. Jack Smith's already going, he's getting [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=522.32s)]
*  rid of all the cases. The only thing left is the New York sentencing. And what I can't see that, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if the president of the United States can touch a New York story. If you saw Latisha [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  James with her bizarre press conference yesterday, he would have to go to the governor. Right. All [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=536.4000000000001s)]
*  right. We'll hear more. We're going to talk more about that in a little bit. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EbNSAwGTo&t=541.5200000000001s)]
