# Speaker Johnson predicts ‘historic’ Election Day: ‘Going to outperform the polls’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY)
*  I do well with Hispanics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=0.0s)]
*  I just got a poll just came out. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=3.04s)]
*  I'm at 56% with Hispanics compared to this woman [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=5.5s)]
*  who is at 36%. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=11.28s)]
*  With your vote, we're going to win Pennsylvania, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=13.24s)]
*  and we're going to defeat Kamala and those radical left. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=15.8s)]
*  We are not going back because America [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=20.52s)]
*  is ready for a fresh start. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=23.96s)]
*  We need everyone to vote Pennsylvania. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=26.6s)]
*  You will make the difference in this election. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=29.28s)]
*  Former President Trump and VP Harris back in Pennsylvania, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=33.84s)]
*  hours before the polls opened, looking [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=37.2s)]
*  to win over key voters, including [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=39.0s)]
*  the over half million Latinos in the Commonwealth who could [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=41.32s)]
*  help decide this election. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=44.56s)]
*  Well, Fox and Friends co-host on the weekend, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=46.24s)]
*  Rachel Campas-Duffy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=49.44s)]
*  Two applause right there is with the Speaker of the House, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Mike Johnson, live from the swing state right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=53.52s)]
*  Rachel, take it away. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=56.44s)]
*  Hey, guys. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=60.24s)]
*  It's so great to be here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=60.76s)]
*  We're at the Superior Restaurant here in Pennsylvania, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=61.84s)]
*  and I'm here with Speaker Johnson. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=64.64s)]
*  Before we get into my first question, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=66.24s)]
*  you and I were flipping pancakes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=68.04s)]
*  By the way, he didn't know he had to wait for the bubbles [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=69.36s)]
*  before he flipped. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=71.6s)]
*  But I taught him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  I do nice rounds. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=73.16s)]
*  I don't know pancakes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=73.76s)]
*  All right, so we did the pancake thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=75.84s)]
*  You've been with the president. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=77.68s)]
*  You told me he said to you that he was going [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=78.68s)]
*  to leave nothing on the table. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=80.48s)]
*  Yeah, about seven weeks ago, we were backstage [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=81.84s)]
*  at the Washington Hilton, and he had done, I think, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=83.72s)]
*  five events in three states that day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=85.6s)]
*  We were touching gloves before we went out to separate [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=87.48s)]
*  and do the swing states again. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=89.72s)]
*  And he got up, buttoned his code. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=90.92s)]
*  His staff said, sir, we got to go. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  The pilots are going to time out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=93.6s)]
*  And I just told him, I said, Mr. President, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=94.84s)]
*  your stamina inspires all of us. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=96.92s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=98.72s)]
*  You don't have to do this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=99.4s)]
*  You had a great life. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=100.32s)]
*  You're taking literal bullets for the team, for the country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=101.72s)]
*  And you know what he told me? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=104.8s)]
*  He said, Mike, we have to leave it all on the field. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  He said, what if we lost? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=107.64s)]
*  We'd never be able to live with ourselves. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  What if we could have done one more event, one more town, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  one more venue, shaken one more hand? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=112.56s)]
*  I said, sir, that is so inspiring. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=114.44s)]
*  So the next morning, we had all the House Republicans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=115.92s)]
*  together for breakfast. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=117.44s)]
*  And I told him that story. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=118.24s)]
*  And I said, if our nominee for president [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=119.08s)]
*  will leave it all on the field like that, work every day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=121.52s)]
*  He told his staff to book every hour of every day [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  until the election. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=126.0s)]
*  You've seen he's done it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=126.92s)]
*  If he can do that, we have to do the same. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=128.12s)]
*  All of us have to do the same for the country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=129.96s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=131.32s)]
*  I want to talk to you about the Hispanic vote. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=132.4s)]
*  Because as you know, there was that unfortunate joke [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=134.4s)]
*  at Madison Square Garden. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=136.84s)]
*  The Democrats definitely tried to capitalize that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  On that, the Hispanic vote, very important in this state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=142.0s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=144.44s)]
*  You've been here on the ground. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=145.12s)]
*  I have been everywhere. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=146.16s)]
*  We've been in Pennsylvania, of course. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=147.08s)]
*  But I've done campaign events in over 260 cities [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=148.24s)]
*  across 40 states. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=150.88s)]
*  We did two in Virginia yesterday. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=152.04s)]
*  We've been all over the place. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=153.76s)]
*  So there are people coming to the events, Rachel, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=154.72s)]
*  that have never been there before. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=157.04s)]
*  And I think the Hispanic and Latino vote [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=158.04s)]
*  is going to be historic this time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=159.8s)]
*  I think there's going to be a demographic shift. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=161.16s)]
*  I think they're coming our way because they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=163.16s)]
*  see the Democratic Party has abandoned [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  the values of the community. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=166.68s)]
*  And they've opened the border wide. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=168.84s)]
*  And that frustrates that community as much as anybody. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=170.4s)]
*  I think this is going to be a big one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to make history here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=174.4s)]
*  I was just going to ask you, what do you think's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=175.36s)]
*  going to happen in this state of Pennsylvania? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=177.04s)]
*  I think we can win Pennsylvania. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=179.36s)]
*  Is Trump going to win Pennsylvania? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=180.56s)]
*  We're going to win Pennsylvania. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=181.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=182.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=183.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=183.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=184.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=184.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=185.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=185.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=186.28s)]
*  What's the Trump shot at a clean sweep of all the swing states? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=186.78s)]
*  And just be honest with us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  We're here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  Listen, my gut tells me that we are [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=194.12s)]
*  going to outperform the polls, OK? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=195.6s)]
*  The polls have them about even. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=197.44s)]
*  Everybody says it's a coin toss. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=198.72s)]
*  If that's true, Trump always outperforms the polls. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=200.12s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=202.76s)]
*  But I want to say every single vote counts, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=203.44s)]
*  especially in the swing states. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=206.2s)]
*  Take nothing for granted. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=207.56s)]
*  We need every single vote today. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=208.8s)]
*  All right, well, there's some folks that have some questions [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  for you, Speaker. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=212.32s)]
*  So we're going to start with you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=213.0s)]
*  Bob? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=214.24s)]
*  Yes, hi. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=214.8s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Speaker. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=215.44s)]
*  Welcome to Allentown. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=216.24s)]
*  With the energy policies as they are now, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=218.44s)]
*  if President Trump gets in, do you [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=223.0s)]
*  feel that we have a great opportunity to not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=224.8s)]
*  have become energy independent but energy dominant? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=227.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=230.04s)]
*  We do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=230.88s)]
*  I'm from an energy state in Louisiana. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=231.4s)]
*  I live on top of the Haynesville Shale, one of the biggest [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=233.24s)]
*  natural gas place. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  We need to frack, frack, frack. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=236.4s)]
*  Don't we? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=238.0s)]
*  Do you all agree with that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=238.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=239.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=240.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=240.52s)]
*  President Trump does as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  And he knows that that's the key not only to our economy, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  energy policy, but also energy policy is national security [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  policy because it's tied directly to our ability [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  to compete on the world stage and to trade with our partners. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=252.24s)]
*  Our European allies need LNG exports desperately. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=254.72s)]
*  President Trump will turn the spigots back on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=258.04s)]
*  All right, this is April. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=259.92s)]
*  April, what's your question for the speaker? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=261.76s)]
*  How do you feel about prices now going up, down, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=263.76s)]
*  with Trump being, hopefully Trump, getting elected? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah, no matter where I am around the country, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=271.76s)]
*  the number one concern is the cost of living [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=273.64s)]
*  in the border, those two things. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  But usually cost of living. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=276.68s)]
*  Moms and dads having to get second and third jobs just [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=277.84s)]
*  to put groceries on the table. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=280.36s)]
*  It's not sustainable. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=281.56s)]
*  So what President Trump will do in a Republican-led Congress, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=282.48s)]
*  because we've got to win the Senate and the House as well, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  I think we will, is that we'll turn the economy back on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=287.32s)]
*  We'll unleash the free market again. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=290.0s)]
*  How? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=291.64s)]
*  We extend the Trump-era tax cuts, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=292.32s)]
*  and then we take a blowtorch to the regulatory state. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=294.44s)]
*  OK, we're going to get the government off [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=296.64s)]
*  the backs of job creators and entrepreneurs and risk takers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=298.44s)]
*  And that is what will unleash the economy, again, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=301.52s)]
*  like we did in the first Trump administration. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=303.76s)]
*  You know, it's been interesting. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=305.8s)]
*  The economy and inflation, definitely the number one issue. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=306.76s)]
*  But I was fascinated when I was right here in this restaurant. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=309.16s)]
*  So many people said the border was their top issue. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=311.88s)]
*  And it was crime, and it was illegality. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=315.12s)]
*  I also got the sense that it's the sense of fairness, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=318.44s)]
*  especially when I talk to some of the Latino voters in here [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=321.32s)]
*  who went through the process legally. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=324.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=325.76s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=326.24s)]
*  I mean, people are so concerned about the open border, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=326.8s)]
*  it's been a catastrophe to the country in so many ways. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=329.0s)]
*  Fentanyl is the leading cause of death now [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=331.76s)]
*  for Americans aged 18 to 49 flowing over the border. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=333.56s)]
*  All these problems. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  We have one more question from this guy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=336.56s)]
*  Come on over here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=337.92s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=338.88s)]
*  Caleb. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=340.0s)]
*  Caleb, what's your question for the speaker? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssEvtuOwnnY&t=341.04s)]
