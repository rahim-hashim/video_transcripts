# Trump considers major pivot on China tariffs: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4)
*  So the White House is expected to hold more high-profile talks with South Korea today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=0.0s)]
*  As the president signals, he may de-escalate tariffs on China to ease tensions, maybe take [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=6.46s)]
*  them down a little bit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=11.72s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson is live in Washington with the details for you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=12.72s)]
*  Hey, Lucas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=15.44s)]
*  Well, good morning, Steve Ainsley and Brian. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=16.44s)]
*  Brian, I hope you got some sleep last night at the late-night China signaling. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=18.04s)]
*  It's open to talks, correct, but warned it will not negotiate under continued pressure [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=21.68s)]
*  from the White House. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=25.82s)]
*  And President Trump threatened to move forward with levying some tariffs on countries in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=26.96s)]
*  the coming weeks absent new trade agreements. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=30.84s)]
*  In the end, I think what's going to happen is we're going to have great deals. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, if we don't have a deal with a company or a country, we're going to set [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=37.88s)]
*  the tariff over the next two, three weeks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=42.28s)]
*  We'll be setting the number and we're going to pick, could be for China too, could be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=44.96s)]
*  for China. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  As you mentioned off the top, The Wall Street Journal reports the Trump administration is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  considering slashing its steep tariffs on China by as much as in half in an effort to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=55.08s)]
*  deescalate tensions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=59.56s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, however, says Trump has not offered to take down tariffs [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=61.04s)]
*  on China on a unilateral basis. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=65.64s)]
*  China's current economic model is built on exporting its way out of its economic troubles. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=69.08s)]
*  It's an unsustainable model that is not only harming China, but the entire world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=74.84s)]
*  China needs to change. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=80.8s)]
*  And here's White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt at the White House yesterday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  The marriage actually worked because China hasn't made any concessions at all. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  Have some patience and you will see. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=92.2s)]
*  A new Fox News poll shows only 33 percent of voters approve of Trump's tariff plan, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  more than a majority, 58 percent disapprove. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=100.2s)]
*  And a dozen Democrat-led states have sued the Trump administration over the tariffs, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  arguing the president does not have the power to impose them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=108.2s)]
*  They say only Congress has the power to legislate tariffs. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=111.28s)]
*  In Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, it does say that Congress shall have power [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=114.28s)]
*  to lay and collect duties, taxes, impose and excises, guys. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=118.52s)]
*  That's right, Lucas, but the Republican-led leadership would have to bring about that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  kind of stuff and they're not really likely to do that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=126.88s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=130.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=131.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=132.84s)]
*  Good job, Lucas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=133.84s)]
*  So a lot of tension in London because I think things are coming to a head. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=134.84s)]
*  the U.K., obviously, then you have the U.S. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=138.6s)]
*  France. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=144.6s)]
*  France, yeah, and the Secretary of State says, I'm not going to go. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=145.6s)]
*  And Woodcoff says, I'm not going to go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=147.84s)]
*  He's upset that Zelensky's making a hard stance saying, I'm not going to give up Crimea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=149.64s)]
*  And I don't blame him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=154.12s)]
*  If things like that happen and it's hard to imagine Russia backing off the territory that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=155.24s)]
*  they have, although they've agreed to back out of some areas of the carcieve, they're [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=160.24s)]
*  never going to acknowledge. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  It's very typical at the end of the conflicts. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=165.52s)]
*  Acknowledge that stolen land, which was literally stolen in 2014, and they expanded it again [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  with an invasion a couple of years later. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=173.88s)]
*  So you could still have Russia in Crimea and have a deal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=176.12s)]
*  But for Zelensky to come out and go, yeah, we're giving up on that, that's never going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  to happen, even though it could be the end result, because in the back of their minds, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=184.28s)]
*  down the line, there might be something where Ukraine gains power or Russia gets a sane [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=189.12s)]
*  leader and they realize they should not have stolen to begin with. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=194.72s)]
*  Well, we're going to be talking about that throughout the morning. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=198.08s)]
*  But going back to what Lucas was talking about internationally once again, you know, it is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=201.08s)]
*  good that the president is softening his stance on China. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=206.32s)]
*  And it makes it sound like something is going to be happening. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=209.56s)]
*  And that's really good. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=212.8s)]
*  But you've got to wonder why exactly he's doing that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=213.8s)]
*  Keep in mind what he's doing is really hard trying to realign global trade balances. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=217.56s)]
*  And Peter Navarro promised 90 deals in 90 days. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=222.44s)]
*  And that's really hard to do. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  That only leaves 11 weeks to get a lot of stuff done. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=228.46s)]
*  You've got to think that the president probably is looking at the numbers. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=231.44s)]
*  And Lucas just talked a little bit about a brand new Fox News poll that shows that tariffs [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=234.72s)]
*  are unpopular with the American public. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=240.2s)]
*  72 percent of Americans say that the tariffs are making things more expensive. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=243.0s)]
*  Fifty five percent say they are hurting the economy and 44 percent say they are hurting jobs. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=248.48s)]
*  And when it comes to one other number, when you look at the S&P 500, it has gotten off [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=254.88s)]
*  to the worst start of any presidency going back to 1928, which is when they started keeping [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  records. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=268.12s)]
*  You've got to figure that you get somebody like Peter Navarro pushing for the tariffs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=269.12s)]
*  And then you've got Scott Besson and Howard Ludnick who are saying, OK, we've got to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=274.76s)]
*  keep in mind the markets and people are getting hurt. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=279.2s)]
*  Well, the administration is saying that these discussions are fluid, that there are several [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=281.88s)]
*  options on the table. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=285.76s)]
*  The president yesterday, he was out on the White House lawn. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=286.92s)]
*  He was out there to find a good location to erect this new huge American flag. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=290.28s)]
*  He's going to put one on both sides, the north side and the south side of the White House. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=297.4s)]
*  And then he was talking to the press and just saying that this is all fluid. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=301.12s)]
*  There are options on the table. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=304.92s)]
*  These tariffs for China are very high. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=306.32s)]
*  They're going to come down. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=308.08s)]
*  But then Beijing is warning that it's not going to negotiate under the continued threats [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=309.32s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=313.96s)]
*  So Trump is softening his stance. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=315.08s)]
*  Maybe Beijing will come to the table because they're not being as threatened as they were [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=317.36s)]
*  before and maybe it will come to an agreement. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=321.0s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=323.16s)]
*  Scott Besson is all in on the tariffs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=324.52s)]
*  He was on the tariffs when he was just a nominee and a thought about becoming treasurer [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=326.6s)]
*  secretary. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  And what he's trying to say is along the way, don't light up J-PAL because it hurts the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  market. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=337.48s)]
*  Don't say things that are going to hurt the market temporarily because you could affect [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=343.16s)]
*  The main goal is happening. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=344.16s)]
*  He's restructuring trade relationships for the future. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  And it was always a way to approach this was hit them hard with tariffs, reorganize, especially [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=349.24s)]
*  As Kevin Hassett said last night, he said, no one gives keep your eye on what's happening [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=356.12s)]
*  with India. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=359.8s)]
*  We were getting it was such an imbalance with India. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=360.8s)]
*  And it's already we already have a framework to fix it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=363.28s)]
*  An imbalance with South Korea framework to fix it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=366.8s)]
*  Japan, they're working out the details now. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=369.44s)]
*  There's always been an imbalance. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  So along the way, that's why the 100 day poll should not even matter. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  Not only is he not running for reelection. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=377.2s)]
*  When you try to do major things, when you disrupt things, obviously people are going [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=379.0s)]
*  to be upset. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=383.4s)]
*  But in the big picture, if things come together and we reorganize these relationships with [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=384.6s)]
*  friends and foes, especially with China, the whole country benefits. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  You know what? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=393.16s)]
*  Trump's net the next four years, I mean, it's going to be even better and more more even [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ce4r39Zu4&t=394.28000000000003s)]
