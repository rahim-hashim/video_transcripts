# ‘HOW DID WE GET HERE?’ America may already have Kamala’s economic record
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY)
*  Trump is taking aim at the state of the economy under the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=0.0s)]
*  People are voting with their stomachs, meaning they're going to the grocery store. They're [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=5.92s)]
*  paying 50, 60, 70 percent more for food than they did just a couple of years ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  It's true. So let's take a look back at what Harris has said about the economy while she's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=15.84s)]
*  been in office. The cost of groceries has gone up. The cost of gas has gone up. It's one of the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=20.16s)]
*  highest priorities actually for the president and for me. Fighting inflation is one of our [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=25.12s)]
*  administration's top economic priorities. For many Americans, prices are still too high, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=29.92s)]
*  and we still have work to do to address that. It's a term we're very proud of, I must tell you, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=36.4s)]
*  because Bidenomics is working. It's working. Prices for everyday things like groceries are [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=41.92s)]
*  still too high. When I am president, it will be my day one priority to fight to bring down [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=48.08s)]
*  prices. Bidenomics is working. Here to help us break down her record, that's Kamala, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=54.64s)]
*  is co-host of the big money show on Fox Business. Taylor Briggs. Hey Taylor. Great to be here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=60.4s)]
*  Absolutely. So she at least acknowledges that inflation is a real thing, which is something [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=65.68s)]
*  you can't avoid because as this first wall is going to show you, it's hit everybody so far, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=70.4s)]
*  over 20 percent since 2021. So here's my thing. Wages, as we've talked about on this program, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=75.04s)]
*  in that period of time, are only up about 15 percent relative to what I call the common man [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=80.72s)]
*  inflation, what every one of us is feeling. Gas, groceries, insurance, taxes, things like that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=85.28s)]
*  And so that's why when we talk about inflation being up 21 percent, it's that our wages aren't [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=90.96s)]
*  keeping up with that, and so we feel poor. My frustration with all of this is she has had [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=95.12s)]
*  365 times three and a half years of day ones to show us economic policy. So it can't be a priority [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  on day one when it should be a priority right now. It should have been a priority the last three and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=109.12s)]
*  a half years. So I would argue frankly we do have our economic record. We've had three and a half [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=113.04s)]
*  years of this economic record and really it's been inflation. People have felt the same thing. So [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  you've got grocery tracks with what we saw in inflation. And then here's a big one Taylor, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=121.36s)]
*  as we move along, credit cards. So if you don't, if your income is not keeping up with the cost of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=125.12s)]
*  living, you got to find it somewhere else. And Americans, this is the highest balance we've ever [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  had. And what really worries me about this is when people are spending some of the necessities [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=135.6s)]
*  on credit cards, that they can't afford to pay it on cash. And that's when you get into that loop. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course right now we've all talked about how high interest rates are. The fact that now [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=144.24s)]
*  your credit card payment interest rate is what maybe 22 percent on sort of an annualized basis. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  So you get into the situation when most people are just trying to pay off the interest. They're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=153.92s)]
*  not even now able to dip into the principle to pay off of that. I recently made the mistake of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=158.24s)]
*  looking at the interest rate on a couple of my credit cards. It's obscene. Yeah. It's obscene. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=162.32s)]
*  And everyone is feeling that. Everyone is. So how do we get here? Let's go to the things that are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=166.88s)]
*  a part of the policies the Biden administration pursued. You've got the American Rescue Plan, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=171.44s)]
*  two trillion dollars in money printing and spending money. They call it the Bipartisan [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=175.44s)]
*  Infrastructure Act. You got a couple of Republicans, ultimately a Green New Deal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=181.44s)]
*  And then an Inflation Reduction Act, which wasn't about inflation at all. It was more spending. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  So how do you defend this record of spending? I don't think you do. Maybe you could argue that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=189.52s)]
*  one. Maybe the 1.9 trillion. Maybe, maybe, maybe coming out of COVID. We were still feeling the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=193.52s)]
*  effects of it. But remember we're over a year now past COVID. And these two I can't definitely [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  justify any of this. I think the irony of all this is not inflation reduction. It was inflation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=203.52s)]
*  increasing because we just talked about debt. Talk about our country's debt. 35 trillion dollars. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=208.72s)]
*  These are tees. This is not billion or million. Trillion dollars of debt. All of this fueling that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  I need to hear from candidates, definitely the left too, how they plan on slowing down some of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=220.0s)]
*  the spending. Well I remember when the debate was going on about the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=224.96s)]
*  Yeah. And they acknowledged it really has nothing to do with inflation. It's just inflation was the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  cause du jour of the moment. And they realized we've got to have something out there to talk [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=233.36s)]
*  about inflation. So they did a big spending bill, threw all the gunk in there and called it about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=236.96s)]
*  reducing inflation when as you point out, it actually had the opposite impact. We're all in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=241.36s)]
*  debt. We're running massive wartime deficits when we're not in war. Someone, I mean eventually the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  buck has to stop. We just don't know when. Well thanks for being here. You can watch more of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  Taylor on The Big Money Show weekdays on Fox Business at 1 p.m. Thanks for being here. Thanks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9L8ImNdHY&t=258.72s)]
