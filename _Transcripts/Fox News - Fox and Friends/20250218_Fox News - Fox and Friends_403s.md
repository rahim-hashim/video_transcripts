# 'SERIOUS STEP': Gov. Hochul weighs removal of NYC Mayor Adams
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE)
*  As we're talking about the cover of the New York Post today, fall from Gracie. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=0.0s)]
*  So you have Mayor Adams, who's losing four deputy mayors today, who are resigning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=4.14s)]
*  They say it was hard enough working for an indicted mayor, but now they believe he's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=9.9s)]
*  compromised because he's allowing Tom Holman to have at it to a degree when it comes to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  legal immigrants. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And they believe that he's not going to be indicted now and he's going to get away from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=21.32s)]
*  it rather than looking at this case. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=24.1s)]
*  So he looks like, today, Kathy Hochul, one of the worst governors in the country, who [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=26.84s)]
*  never should have been a governor. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=32.04s)]
*  It's a total mistake. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=33.24s)]
*  She was brought in by Governor Cuomo to try to seal up Buffalo area, northern part of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=34.96s)]
*  New York State, and even though he didn't even need it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=40.28s)]
*  And now she's governor. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=42.8s)]
*  So now she's going to meet with, in Manhattan today, with some higher-ups to see about removing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=44.04s)]
*  a mayor, an elected mayor, for the first time in 235 years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=47.68s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=53.52s)]
*  I don't understand Democrats in New York City. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=54.52s)]
*  So this is the mayor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  This is the governor that allowed all these liberal DAs to have violent offenders on the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=58.24s)]
*  street that were murdering people, raping them, assaulting people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=63.2s)]
*  She didn't remove any of those DAs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=66.92s)]
*  But now she wants to remove the mayor for working with the president of the United States [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=69.44s)]
*  to keep the city safe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=73.08s)]
*  Talk about priorities here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=75.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  And we had the mayor on our show on Friday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  And you know, her side is talking about there was a quid pro quo going on because the charges [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=81.28s)]
*  of corruption were dropped against him because that way he could cooperate with this Republican [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=87.32s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=92.56s)]
*  And that's why everybody's hair is on fire here in New York City. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=93.8s)]
*  Well, he denies that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=97.0s)]
*  Well, of course he does because it's against the law. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=98.0s)]
*  And that's what he said here on the couch. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  What's interesting about this 10 o'clock meeting that she's having over on the East Side in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=102.08s)]
*  her office here in Manhattan is that one of the people invited is Al Sharpton. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=106.0s)]
*  And Al Sharpton is blaming the current situation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=111.6s)]
*  This is delicious. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=115.64s)]
*  On Donald Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=116.64s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=117.64s)]
*  Well, if he is removed, if she removes him and she has the power to do that, it's never [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=118.64s)]
*  been used before, but she could do it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=122.18s)]
*  She would be overturning the will of the voters. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=125.08s)]
*  And that's a serious. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=127.18s)]
*  The voters wanted him to be the mayor. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=128.4s)]
*  And if he does leave before his term ends, Jumaane Williams would temporarily become [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=131.2s)]
*  the mayor because the election is this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  Jumaane is this November. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  And you say he's extremely liberal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=139.64s)]
*  He's way to the left. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=141.28s)]
*  This guy is de Blasio way to the left of everybody. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=142.76s)]
*  Why would he take over? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  I guess the public advocate would take over. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=148.12s)]
*  I don't know what kind of system New York has. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=152.44s)]
*  But here's what Kathy Hoco said. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=155.0s)]
*  I recognize the immense responsibility. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  I hold this governor and the constitutional powers granted to this office in the 235 years [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=158.24s)]
*  of New York. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  Their powers have never been utilized to remove a duly elected mayor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  Overturning the will of voters is a serious step that should not be taken lightly. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  So right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=171.96s)]
*  So you're going to be taking it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=172.96s)]
*  By the way, if President Trump, you know, you want that congestion pricing, you want [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=174.08s)]
*  all this other crap that's going on in New York City. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=178.88s)]
*  He wants to get rid of bike lanes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  He wants to get rid of congestion pricing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  And he's saying don't do it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=185.56s)]
*  He said, at least the phonics going to be delayed till September. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=187.04s)]
*  She's beginning to pull that back. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=190.12s)]
*  That was King Jeffrey's idea. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=191.92s)]
*  So the president Trump could pick up the phone and say, you get rid of Eric Adams and the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=193.4s)]
*  whole hell is going to break loose in your city. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=197.68s)]
*  But Brian, at his core, I don't understand why the Democrats hate democracy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=199.52s)]
*  I mean, we heard it throughout the presidential race, democracy, democracy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=203.0s)]
*  There's an election coming up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=206.8s)]
*  If there's any type of corruption or let the voters decide. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=208.44s)]
*  And so that's why I think to that point, Lawrence, you know, it's just a couple of months until [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=212.92s)]
*  he'll probably lose his office anyway. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=218.32s)]
*  I think today she's going to come out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=220.96s)]
*  They're going to condemn him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=222.56s)]
*  She's not going to do anything. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=223.72s)]
*  But it's just his constant drumbeat, you know, for the primary voters. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=225.24s)]
*  And there aren't that many here in New York City when it rolls around every couple of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=228.68s)]
*  years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=232.92s)]
*  They're going to be reading all this stuff. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=233.92s)]
*  And it's like, oh, we can't really like that guy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's go back to Cuomo. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=237.96s)]
*  Look for Andrew Cuomo to be the next mayor of New York. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=239.24s)]
*  That's going to go so well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  So we we were interviewing the mayor and Tom Homan last Friday. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=243.76s)]
*  If you missed it, here's a clip. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=247.28s)]
*  She has her role. I have my role. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=249.76s)]
*  And throughout this entire ordeal, which I think no Americans should have to go through [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=251.6s)]
*  the torment of 15 months that my family and I had to endure for something I didn't do, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  I didn't do anything wrong throughout the entire ordeal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=261.12s)]
*  I said one thing, my attorney will handle the legal part. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=263.88s)]
*  I'm going to handle running the city. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  We return jobs to our city. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=269.24s)]
*  Our city is getting safer. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=270.92s)]
*  We're building housing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=272.0s)]
*  I think that this is a great American narrative. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=273.36s)]
*  I stood focus on what I was elected to do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=276.52s)]
*  You're going to run for election? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=278.56s)]
*  Yes. Are you considering running as a Republican? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=279.52s)]
*  I'm going to run on a Democratic line. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=281.96s)]
*  We petitioning to start it starting soon. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=283.88s)]
*  Running as a Democrat. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=287.36s)]
*  There's a many Democrats like you look at the 78 percent that believe what we do with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=289.16s)]
*  ICE is doing by getting dangerous people out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=293.04s)]
*  I think that we have to get people out to vote. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=295.28s)]
*  That is the problem. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=297.72s)]
*  Listen, so the mayor also has gotten, been very fair to the Trumps. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  As early as 2022 after de Blasio painted things in the street, took his, took woman [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=304.8s)]
*  rink away, made him sell the golf course. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  He came in and said, I have nothing against these people. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=312.68s)]
*  And I know Eric in particular, because he's running the organization, said, I appreciate [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=315.16s)]
*  it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=318.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't want any favors. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=319.44000000000005s)]
*  Just don't target me. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=320.44000000000005s)]
*  And I think that helped those two talk. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=321.44000000000005s)]
*  I think that Trump and Trump and the mayor talked just like have a civil relationship. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=324.2s)]
*  I just don't like, I'm sorry, I just don't like the appearance of targeting from the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=330.08s)]
*  Department of Justice. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=335.28s)]
*  I don't know all the facts of this case. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=336.64s)]
*  I think that could have been litigated. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=338.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmxx1wjQbdE&t=340.24s)]
