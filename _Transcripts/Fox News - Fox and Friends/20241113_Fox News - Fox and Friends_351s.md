# 'They've learned nothing': Left melts down over Trump announcement
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU)
*  As president-elect Trump's team begins to take shape and lefts the left's attack are well underway as you know [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats and the media attempting to smear newly selected borders are Tom Homan watch [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=7.12s)]
*  the appointment of Tom Homan today as [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Border SAR and he will be in charge of a mass deportation program what it means is grandmothers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=15.64s)]
*  What it means is brothers and aunts what it means is our well [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=21.92s)]
*  Tom Homan has been promising mass deportations and camps to hold millions of people in this country [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=26.98s)]
*  Bragging about how he's going to be the man who will mercilessly come after immigrants [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=33.86s)]
*  But critics fail to realize Homan's long career in Homeland Security that spans nearly 40 years [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=39.14s)]
*  over both Republican and Democrat administrations in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=45.94s)]
*  2015 he was awarded for his work under the Obama administration [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=49.26s)]
*  Before serving as acting ICE director under Donald Trump joining us now Fox News contributor Ben Dominich. Good morning to you Ben [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=52.66s)]
*  Good morning, good morning. Have they learned nothing? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=61.86s)]
*  I mean it sounds like what they were saying two weeks ago and America spoke they want a safer country [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=64.26s)]
*  What is what's your reaction? No [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=71.1s)]
*  They've absolutely learned nothing Ainsley and I think that one of the things that's important to know about Tom Homan [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad that you mentioned it is that he's served under both Republican and Democrat administrations [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=78.54s)]
*  He's been around this for a long time and one of the things that I think is so critical that he understands [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=83.02s)]
*  Is that we're not just going to revert to this the approach that was used under President Trump's first term a lot of people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=87.7s)]
*  You know point to the success of the remain in Mexico program and things like that that were put in place under that term [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=94.06s)]
*  And of course that for the time was something that could work, but we're beyond that point now [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  We've gone from AMLO the former leader in Mexico to his apprentice Claudia Scheinbaum [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=103.24s)]
*  Who's now in charge and we can no longer trust the Mexican government when it comes to any of these things [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=108.92s)]
*  We need to have a much more aggressive approach to the border a more aggressive approach that includes going after cartels [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=113.56s)]
*  Going after their money and when it comes to enforcing our laws not accepting [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=119.96s)]
*  Anything that they say from Mexico on face value. We simply have learned at this point that we cannot trust them [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=124.8s)]
*  Tom Homan knows that it's why it's so important that we have someone who understands that in this job [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=130.44s)]
*  Yeah, so here he is pushing back against the media critics watch this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=135.48s)]
*  President Trump has made it clear [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=140.76s)]
*  We will prioritize public safety threats and national security threats first you're in the country legally. You shouldn't feel comfortable. Absolutely not [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=142.52s)]
*  I won't feel comfortable if I'm in the country illegally [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=150.2s)]
*  You shouldn't be comfortable either because when you enter this country legally you have committed a crime [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=152.32s)]
*  You are a criminal and you're not off the table [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=157.24s)]
*  Yeah, so Ben, why are they so focused on? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=160.24s)]
*  Grandmothers and moms and dads. Why don't they focus on the criminals? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  He says this was his quote the the first will be the worst will be first [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=166.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's so important to understand about this and it's the thing that I think the left has been in such denial [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=173.04s)]
*  About it's one of the reasons that they just got hammered in this election [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=178.52s)]
*  It's because they refuse to believe that there is a criminal element that is clearly following [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  These migration trends that we've seen happen time and again [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=186.6s)]
*  We've seen a historic heights of sex trafficking and the like explode under the Biden Harris administration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=189.36s)]
*  Tom Homan is about bringing a stop to that and I think he's going to have the right priorities in mind when it comes to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=196.08s)]
*  criminals and security threats to the American people [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=201.0s)]
*  Your wife used to be on the view [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=203.0s)]
*  Do you really think they they just refuse to believe or do you think they just hate Donald Trump so much? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=204.48s)]
*  They're trying to to just fear monger [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Ainsley you're touching on the PTSD that I have from that period of life [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=212.78s)]
*  I think I think they're in total. They're in total denial [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=217.9s)]
*  They can't accept it and look the the simple takeaway that they have from this election is oh, it's the voters who are wrong [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=221.14s)]
*  They're the ones who are wrong about what's going on in our country. Well, guess what? They're right. They understand what's going on [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=227.3s)]
*  It's you who's out of touch [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=232.06s)]
*  It's you who can't acknowledge the fact that this is such a serious problem in communities [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Not just on the border but across America as we've seen over the past several years the Biden-Harris administration [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=237.72s)]
*  Looked away for far too long the American people bore the brunt of the ramifications of that and this new Trump administration [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=242.64s)]
*  I believe is going to have this as priority number one when they get back to the White House [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=249.32s)]
*  All right, so Ben for it for the people who don't know much about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=252.94s)]
*  Tom Homan, let's just go over his resume New York police officer. He was a border patrol agent [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=257.28s)]
*  He led ICE's enforcement and removal under President Obama [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=263.72s)]
*  Then he was the I the acting ICE director under Donald Trump. He worked then we can't harp on this enough [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=268.2s)]
*  He worked for two administrations a Republican and a Democrat. He just loves this country. It's common sense [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  He wants to do the right thing and make sure people are not coming across our border, especially criminals [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=281.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that one of the things that you see there too is how much the left has shifted over the years [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=287.12s)]
*  You know people talked about Obama, you know [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=291.88s)]
*  and in his time in office as being the deporter-in-chief that he was someone who understood that he actually in order to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=293.96s)]
*  You know hold together his coalition [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=299.2s)]
*  He needed to be a little tougher on the border than some of the other Democrats there [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=301.24s)]
*  But the progressive left has taken over the coalition so much that you're not allowed to say that anymore this Obama this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=304.32s)]
*  The Obama administration versus the Biden administration, you know [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  It was night and day and I think that one of the things that we saw under [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=313.82s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas and the way that he approached this whole thing was he just didn't do his job for three and a half years [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=316.2s)]
*  He looked the other way on purpose. He cared more about you know allegations of people whipping [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=321.6s)]
*  migrants and the like than he did about securing our border that's going to change when Donald Trump gets back into the White House and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  A big it's a big part of the reason why he's headed back there. All right, then. Thank you so much [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfW_kmLIBU&t=331.64000000000004s)]
