Video Description: Boston Mayor Michelle Wu raised eyebrows over the weekend after she expressed condolences to the family of a knife-wielding suspect who was shot and killed by an off-duty officer after he allegedly tried to stab two people on Saturday night.

# Liberal mayor under fire after shocking condolences to attacker's family
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg)
*  The mayor in Boston, Michelle Wu, she was criticized last year because she suggested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=0.0s)]
*  giving illegals, even as young as 11 years old, voting rights. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=5.48s)]
*  Then in December of 2023, she hosted a secret elected of color holiday party and white officials [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=9.92s)]
*  were not allowed to attend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=17.14s)]
*  And she said her city will not cooperate with Donald Trump's mass deportation effort, despite [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=19.22s)]
*  ICE rounding up four alleged child rapists and also a suspected member of the MS-13 gang. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=23.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, there was this guy that was in a Chick-fil-A, because this could add to her [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  resume, was in a Chick-fil-A and he was in an act, he was caught trying to stab two people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=32.88s)]
*  Mayor Wu, then he ended up getting killed by an off-duty cop. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=39.04s)]
*  Mayor Wu expressed condolences to the attacker. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Listen to her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=47.08s)]
*  My condolences and all of our thoughts are with the family of the individual whose life [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=49.16s)]
*  has been lost. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=57.42s)]
*  And I'm also thinking of all the people who were impacted here today in one of the busier [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=59.34s)]
*  parts of the city with this tragedy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=67.9s)]
*  I dare her. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=71.66s)]
*  She's flanked behind her. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  You see all these cops. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=75.0s)]
*  And this person tried to take on cops. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=77.26s)]
*  And she offers condolences to the person that was trying to- I don't care about the person [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=79.22s)]
*  that tried to stab the cop. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=83.86s)]
*  If he died as a result of it, offer him Christ and he's going to have his judgment day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  But I mean, it's just not common sense to do that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=90.86s)]
*  Well, here's what makes no sense. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=93.62s)]
*  So you're looking at Back Bay, the really nice neighborhood in downtown Boston, and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=96.18s)]
*  this couple was being chased down the street by a man with a knife, threatening to kill [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=106.66s)]
*  They ran into the Chick-fil-A to seek shelter and there was an off-duty cop in there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=107.66s)]
*  And the off-duty cop pulls out a gun and tells the guy to put the knife down and he [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=112.26s)]
*  didn't do it and he shot the person who was trying to kill the people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=115.98s)]
*  And so that is the family that they are- that the mayor is apologizing to and sending condolences [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=120.68s)]
*  to. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=127.26s)]
*  The family of the guy with the knife who tried to kill, it sounds like at least two people, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=128.26s)]
*  maybe three, maybe ten. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=132.74s)]
*  Just so liberal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  It's upside down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=135.54000000000002s)]
*  Suffolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Kevin Hayden, his office is leading the post-shooting [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=136.54000000000002s)]
*  investigation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=141.86s)]
*  He offered thoughts and prayers to the unidentified assailants' family and friends, too. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=142.86s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  And finally, before we leave- [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  It's why they lose. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  When those mayors go in front of the panel, Steve, those Ivy League presidents got consulted [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  by attorneys. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  And they were scripted by their attorneys. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  So these mayors should watch it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=159.38000000000002s)]
*  Can't help you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=161.38000000000002s)]
*  They look like they're trying to avoid a lawsuit, like these were, or arrogantly say, this is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=162.38000000000002s)]
*  what the people want. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=168.9s)]
*  People outside your little bubble, I'm pretty sure have moved past them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=169.94s)]
*  Well, Brian, I think what they're going to do is they're going to say, our city charter [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=173.82s)]
*  says we have to do this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  And so the lawyers tell me that's all I can do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  Eric Adams, you know, he's going to sit down and he's going to say, look, he's going to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=180.86s)]
*  be able to say, hey, I'm cooperating with the Trump administration because I signed [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=185.06s)]
*  that executive order that allowed ICE to return to Rikers Island. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=189.34s)]
*  But the others, they're going to be right down to the letter of the law as their protection. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  So the follow up question is then if they say the city charter, are you going to change [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=199.38s)]
*  it? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=203.18s)]
*  Like, you can't just say. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=204.18s)]
*  And then they're going to say, well, I need the whole council. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=205.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=207.26s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=208.26s)]
*  So, but we have your support of changing the charter so we can arrest criminal migrants, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=209.26s)]
*  right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=212.94s)]
*  Mayor Adams disagreed with me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=213.94s)]
*  Brian was saying, don't let them in the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=214.94s)]
*  If they're here illegally, get them out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=216.46s)]
*  And Mayor Adams said, if they're here in our city, he said, because we're a sanctuary city, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=218.34s)]
*  if they're paying taxes, even if they're illegal, they should have the right to hospitals and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=222.1s)]
*  the police and all of our services. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=226.54s)]
*  But he said, if they're criminals, I support going. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=228.62s)]
*  That's where he draws a line. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=231.9s)]
*  The problem is they will back up their statements. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=232.9s)]
*  Everything we think is outrageous and gotcha. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=235.02s)]
*  No, they want to be got. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  They'll have answers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  They know. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  But their answers are I am for illegal immigrants. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't support giving the Heisman to ICE. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=241.94s)]
*  And that's where that's where it's all going to the facts will indict them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=245.22000000000003s)]
*  The Heisman to ICE or the Iceman to ICE? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=250.02s)]
*  Keep doing it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=253.5s)]
*  They'll lose elections. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=255.06s)]
*  I mean, it's just common sense. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=256.06s)]
*  Not in these cities. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=257.54s)]
*  Republicans don't run anybody. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=258.54s)]
*  So it's going to be fireworks on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=260.82s)]
*  You'll see it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  You'll see it here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  Here's your Republican. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  So meanwhile, you got an off duty police officer coming to the rescue, stopping a knife attack [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  inside of a busy Chick-fil-A. Happened in Boston, the suspect shot dead after ignoring [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=272.22s)]
*  repeated commands that dropped the weapon. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=277.58000000000004s)]
*  But instead of thanking the officer, the Democratic mayor offered condolences to the families [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=280.1s)]
*  of the dead suspect. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=285.36s)]
*  Some folks got a problem with that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=287.54s)]
*  Molly Lyon follows that story in Boston. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=289.02s)]
*  What happened, Molly? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=290.98s)]
*  Hello. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=291.98s)]
*  Good morning, Bill. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=292.98s)]

*  this case after expressing her condolences to the man who, according to investigators, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=300.94s)]
*  had been attempting to stab several people inside of this Chick-fil-A in Boston, prompting [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=305.22s)]

*  We're proud of police officers who activate themselves, whether it's on duty or off duty, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=377.4s)]
*  to try to save lives. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=383.08s)]
*  But we're asking for the public support and help. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  If anyone was here, it's a pretty busy area to contact us. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=387.44s)]
*  Among those slamming Mayor Wu, South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace writing on ex-condolences [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=394.84s)]
*  from the mayor of Boston, wait for it, to a knife wielding man trying to kill people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=399.86s)]
*  Thankfully this guy was stopped in his tracks by a brave law enforcement officer. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  Notably, Mace sits on the House Oversight Committee. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=408.02s)]
*  That is the committee that Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is slated to testify before later on this [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=410.98s)]
*  week. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=416.54s)]
*  She's expected to defend the status of Boston as a sanctuary city and Wu often touts Boston [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=417.54s)]
*  as the safest major city in the country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=423.18s)]
*  Bill? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=425.94s)]
*  Okay, full follow-up. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=426.94s)]
*  Smiley Line in Boston on that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=427.94s)]
*  Thank you, Dana. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=429.7s)]
*  Carly Schimkes and Jimmy Fela join us here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=430.7s)]
*  She's going to be on the Hill this week talking about immigration. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=434.86s)]
*  She's the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to talking points, but the poor city [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=437.38s)]
*  of Boston. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=442.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be a fiery hearing with the Oversight Committee later this week, so [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=443.14s)]
*  certainly something to watch out for. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=447.82s)]
*  This is a classic progressive ideology on full display where the criminal is the victim [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=449.46s)]
*  and the actual victim is an afterthought. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=453.44s)]
*  And I think you can make a connection between that line of thinking and why Donald Trump [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=455.9s)]
*  is in office. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=459.53999999999996s)]
*  And for a mayor, no matter what you think, this is a very easy situation to respond to. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=461.12s)]
*  You say, my thoughts are with the victims who went through a terrifying ordeal. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=465.94s)]
*  Any loss of life is a tragedy, but we're so grateful for the police for defending the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=469.7s)]
*  innocent victims here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=474.17999999999995s)]
*  So you could say, you know, maybe was this a stumble on her behalf or, like I said, is [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=475.82s)]
*  this her ideology? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=480.41999999999996s)]
*  that she's taken? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=483.1s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's easy to say that it is the latter in this case. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=484.74s)]
*  I think the compass is broken in these cities comparative to the rest of us. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=487.98s)]
*  Like if you look at her popularity within the city of Boston, it's not that bad. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=491.5s)]
*  She's actually winning in her re-election bid against Josh Craft right now, so they [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  don't see the world through the lens we do. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=498.74s)]
*  The rest of the country grew up playing two games in their backyard. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=501.42s)]
*  They played cops and robbers, cowboys and Elizabeth Warrens. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=504.26000000000005s)]
*  But when you were playing cops, sorry, when you were playing cops and robbers, you knew [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=507.26000000000005s)]
*  the cops were the good guys, the robbers were the bad guys. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=510.42s)]
*  This is a basic broken compass issue that only exists in blue cities. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=512.74s)]
*  And to your point, the election showed us that because outside of the cities themselves, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=516.22s)]
*  Trump won the whole map. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=519.86s)]
*  Well, speaking of blue cities, we live in one, New York City, and let's just just curious, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=520.86s)]
*  that COVID was a problem, but it's not the problem that we're facing right now. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=524.66s)]
*  Still, former governor Cuomo, he says he wants to run for mayor, and this is why. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=527.98s)]
*  Watch, call for number three. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=532.98s)]
*  COVID, my friends, was the greatest threat faced in a generation. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=536.02s)]
*  It was life and death. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=542.62s)]
*  It was as serious as it gets, and it was as scary as it gets. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=545.76s)]
*  And New York, we had it first, and we had it worst, and we were on our own. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=552.98s)]
*  And no one knew what to do. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=561.02s)]
*  Well, what did we do? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=563.98s)]
*  We came together, we stood tall, we stood strong, and we faced the challenge head on. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=565.9s)]
*  So there have been rumors for a while, Carly, that he was going to throw his hat in the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=572.26s)]
*  ring. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=574.78s)]
*  I'm shocked that this is what he decided to lead with. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=575.78s)]
*  Yes, because it is an absolute spit in the face to all the nursing home families who [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=578.02s)]
*  say, are you really going to bring up COVID during your launch statement for mayor after [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=581.66s)]
*  your extreme fall from grace as governor of the state? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=586.46s)]
*  By the way, he is still facing legal challenges for sexual harassment, the book deal, and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=590.1s)]
*  the COVID family. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=594.98s)]
*  So if he thinks he can go in there and run for mayor, and maybe some of Mayor Adams' [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=596.0600000000001s)]
*  legal challenges, he thinks could be a way for him to make his entry as mayor. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=601.72s)]
*  I mean, the legal challenge that he's still facing undercuts that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=606.1400000000001s)]
*  New York Post headline, nursing home families urge New York City voters to reject Andrew [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=608.6600000000001s)]
*  Cuomo as mayor over COVID death. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  This would be the Achilles heel. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=614.8800000000001s)]
*  We'll see how the campaign goes. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=616.2600000000001s)]
*  Should be. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=618.0200000000001s)]
*  And I'll just add to Rosa. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=619.1s)]
*  If you remember in 2021, admitted on that Democratic conference call that they kind [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=620.1s)]
*  of withheld the numbers. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=623.1s)]
*  They froze is what she attributed it to. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=624.22s)]
*  But a lot of that also had to do, you know, reportedly with him writing that book. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  And don't ever forget, on a basic judgment level, he wrote a book congratulating himself [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=630.14s)]
*  how he handled COVID in the middle of COVID. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=633.8199999999999s)]
*  This is the equivalent of a football coach dumping the Gatorade on himself at halftime [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=636.22s)]
*  of a game he's losing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=640.22s)]
*  Okay, so that judgment alone should be out the window. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=641.5799999999999s)]
*  But New York is liberal enough that he thinks he has it in the bag. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=644.38s)]
*  Reportedly, he's already measuring the interns. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=647.9000000000001s)]
*  So hey, there it is. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=649.9000000000001s)]
*  Morning. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=651.9000000000001s)]
*  Jimmy! [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=652.9000000000001s)]
*  Happy Monday, everybody. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=653.9000000000001s)]
*  Call back. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=654.9000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Zoe. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=655.9000000000001s)]
*  Very good. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=656.9000000000001s)]
*  The best. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=657.9000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGXFRm8zsIg&t=658.9000000000001s)]
