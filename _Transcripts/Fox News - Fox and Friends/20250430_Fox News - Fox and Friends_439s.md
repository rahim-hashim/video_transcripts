# 'FOOLS!': Hosts break down in laughter over Dems' all-night anti-Trump tirade
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w)
*  So now, you know, what's going on on Capitol Hill, they're trying to figure out how to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=0.0s)]
*  bring forward the next—the big thing, the big, beautiful bill, which Donald Trump has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=4.72s)]
*  been talking about, ran on extending the tax cuts from 2017 and stuff like that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=10.94s)]
*  You mentioned Scott Besson. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=15.5s)]
*  Apparently, he and Kevin Hassett met with senior members of the Senate and the House [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=17.06s)]
*  on Monday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=22.78s)]
*  And what they told them was that Donald Trump wants a tax—wants part of the tax bill to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=23.78s)]
*  also include bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which, you know, you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=29.46s)]
*  went down the laundry list of all these big companies. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=34.5s)]
*  The problem is that's going to cost a lot of money, and they didn't think that the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=37.02s)]
*  president was serious about that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=41.7s)]
*  They thought they wanted—the president wanted to be able to deduct car interest. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=43.22s)]
*  They knew that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  But that's one of the provisions that they said, you know, they should get a tax deduction [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  if they buy a car made with—that's completely built in in the United States, and also 100 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=53.92s)]
*  percent expensive, which businesses would love. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=59.26s)]
*  But now the senators are going, we don't know where that money's going to come from, and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=61.94s)]
*  that is one of the reasons it's going so slow right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=65.98s)]
*  I think the big thing is that you see the Republicans rolling up their sleeves. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=68.94s)]
*  They're having this debate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=72.86s)]
*  They're trying to deliver on what the president wanted to get done. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=73.86s)]
*  And the Democrats are acting like complete fools. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=78.06s)]
*  Just look at the Democratic senators last night while the Republicans are working. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=80.82s)]
*  This is what they're doing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=85.9s)]
*  Another marathon speech. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=86.9s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=87.9s)]
*  This week marks the 100th day of Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=89.30000000000001s)]
*  It's been 100 days from hell. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=98.06s)]
*  Chaos. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=100.34s)]
*  Corruption. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=101.34s)]
*  Costs. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=102.34s)]
*  It's chaos. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=103.34s)]
*  One fiasco after another. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=105.26s)]
*  In 100 days, what can a president accomplish? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  The last 100 days, President Trump has made Americans less safe, less prosperous, and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  less free. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=117.14000000000001s)]
*  Today I am reading into the Congressional Record 100 reports of corruption from Donald [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=118.14s)]
*  Trump's first 100 days in office. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=124.06s)]
*  Trump and his administration have paved the way for the president, his top officials, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=126.74s)]
*  and his billionaire buddies to personally feed at the trough of government corruption. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=132.82s)]
*  So count with me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=139.5s)]
*  So what a boring PowerPoint presentation from these people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=142.18s)]
*  When in doubt, have a sit-in, sing along, protest, curse a lot. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=146.22s)]
*  That's all we know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=150.62s)]
*  They're not happy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=151.62s)]
*  So obviously... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=152.62s)]
*  I want more sing-alongs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=153.62s)]
*  The sing-along's more interesting than that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=154.62s)]
*  Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=156.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=159.02s)]
*  Right there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=160.02s)]
*  Right, but the thing that you pointed out too, they were clapping along or tapping their [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=161.02s)]
*  thighs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  I think you should make a choice. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  Clap with your thighs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  As long as you're hitting other people's thighs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  I can't get enough of that video. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  Sean started a show last night with it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=171.3s)]
*  It's great. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=173.5s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=174.5s)]
*  When in doubt, it's so anti-American. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=175.82s)]
*  When in doubt, sit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=176.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=177.82s)]
*  I want to take action. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=178.82s)]
*  I just got to sit down. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=179.82s)]
*  I'm just going to ramble on. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=180.82s)]
*  Anyone got anything to sing? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=182.82s)]
*  Well, this is one of their messages last night. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=184.42s)]
*  They made Americans, Donald Trump has made Americans less safe, less prosperous, and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=186.46s)]
*  less free. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=190.5s)]
*  Less safe! [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=191.5s)]
*  He's closed the border. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=192.5s)]
*  Illegal encounters are down 95%. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=193.5s)]
*  They do not have a message. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=195.1s)]
*  The Democrats are saying he's going to take away your Medicaid. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=196.74s)]
*  And we can talk about this today when we have some guests that are coming up that know specifically [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=200.06s)]
*  that Donald Trump has never said that, has never wanted to do that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=204.24s)]
*  But Chuck Schumer was on the floor saying, if you have loved ones, I've gone to all the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=207.64s)]
*  Republican districts in New York and some of them have loved ones in nursing homes and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=212.12s)]
*  in hospitals and they're worried he's going to take away their Medicaid. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=215.68s)]
*  So they're trying to run on that and they're trying to run on the billionaire thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=218.2s)]
*  Donald Trump just wants to make billionaires richer. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=222.28s)]
*  Nobody wants to make everyone richer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=224.4s)]
*  Here's Senator John Kennedy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=226.24s)]
*  He thinks he's picked up a trend. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=227.88s)]
*  The Democratic Party today is not defined by its principles. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=231.32s)]
*  It's defined by one thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  It's hatred of President Trump, even when he's right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=239.56s)]
*  For example, in the first hundred days, President Trump secured the border. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=243.56s)]
*  The Democrats were opposed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  In his first hundred days, President Trump started deregulating the economy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=251.48s)]
*  The Democrats were opposed and are opposed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=255.98s)]
*  The president in his first hundred days has backed Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=258.4s)]
*  He stood up to China. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=262.4s)]
*  He stood up to Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=264.35999999999996s)]
*  The Democrats are opposed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=268.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's so ridiculous some of the stuff they're suggesting. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=269.76s)]
*  So the new message is the president and his administration are just picking people up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  They're just picking. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=278.28s)]
*  Now, they won't tell you that it's the criminals that have been harassing Americans, killing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=279.28s)]
*  people, murderers and all that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  Michelle Obama goes on her podcast and she goes, it's keeping her up at night. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=285.88s)]
*  She can't sleep. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=289.76s)]
*  Now, she has a JD. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=290.76s)]
*  If she was so concerned about it, she could go work at an immigration law firm and deliver [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=292.36s)]
*  for these people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=298.76s)]
*  Now, some of these people, her husband actually deported and they came back to the country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=299.76s)]
*  So it was totally okay when her husband, or maybe she disagreed with her husband. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=305.64s)]
*  Maybe she was upset about that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=310.04s)]
*  But all of a sudden, they can't sleep at night, but they had no problem sleeping when [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=311.64s)]
*  they were murdering American citizens in this country. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=316.8s)]
*  It's just weird. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=319.2s)]
*  When I got word that the human trafficker was in El Salvador, I was tossing and turning. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=320.2s)]
*  And my aura ring picked it up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=323.8s)]
*  You need some relaxium. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=326.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=327.0s)]
*  I need some relaxium. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=328.0s)]
*  Didn't have the deep sleep, got plenty of rem. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=329.0s)]
*  More on that later. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=330.64s)]
*  But it's amazing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=331.64s)]
*  People are like, what keeps you up at night? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=332.64s)]
*  Everyone keeps using that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=335.64s)]
*  Last night, President Trump played that video that he has of all of them being deported and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=336.64s)]
*  going to the prison. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=341.4s)]
*  And everyone started chanting, USA, USA. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=342.4s)]
*  I want to talk about it later, I know. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=346.32s)]
*  But I think the key to success for Democrats is Governor Rick Whitmer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=348.0s)]
*  I know she didn't play out her speaking yesterday. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=352.2s)]
*  But she's like, he's in my city, he's in my state, and he's talking to the military. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=354.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm going to show up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=359.32s)]
*  And that's what you do. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=360.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm different from him. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  I would be a different president. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=363.56s)]
*  But I don't hate everything he's doing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=364.84s)]
*  To me, I thought that was the path that we usually go on. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=366.32s)]
*  Well, the good thing was she didn't hide her face. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=369.4s)]
*  She was very proud to be there because she had gone to White House. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  That was the craziest reaction ever. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=374.28s)]
*  And we're going to show you some of that video in a little bit. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  Nonetheless, the message from the Democrats is we don't have a message other than Trump [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  bad. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=381.79999999999995s)]
*  Trump very bad. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  And he's 100 days bad. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  And so what they're doing now is they're simply looking to the next person. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=385.96s)]
*  Who's the next person going to be? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  Without the big guns. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, it sounds like… [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  Kamala. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Kamala is the last person. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  And tonight, she's going to be doing a speech in San Francisco for Emerge America. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=395.26s)]
*  It's a candidate training program that backs Democratic women. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=399.86s)]
*  And it was created… [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=406.18s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=407.46s)]
*  I've got to write that down because I forget this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=408.46s)]
*  You can have my notes when I'm done. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=410.14s)]
*  OK, good. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=411.14s)]
*  It was created after she ran in 2003 for San Francisco's DA. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=412.14s)]
*  And she won. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=418.12s)]
*  Glory to God. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=419.12s)]
*  Because she ran against a white man. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=420.12s)]
*  And so that organization was inspired. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=421.26s)]
*  And it came out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=423.98s)]
*  And now she's back. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=425.1s)]
*  She's going to raise money for him. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNi_2_b-7w&t=426.1s)]
