*  You bet. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=14.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=15.0s)]
*  So our producers put Lucas up to that and... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=16.0s)]
*  It's a test, I was like do I do this? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=21.0s)]
*  I was like Charlie's kind of old school. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=23.0s)]
*  Also, recorded without my consent by the way. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=24.0s)]
*  It was recorded without your consent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=26.0s)]

*  I think it's illegal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=29.0s)]
*  I think it's illegal in Virginia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=30.0s)]
*  It's two party consent in Virginia. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=31.0s)]
*  But what were you thinking about him? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=32.0s)]
*  So he calls you and says... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=34.0s)]
*  Fair question, fair question. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=36.0s)]
*  I'll be honest, I was worried. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=38.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=40.0s)]
*  I was a little worried. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=41.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1lP7WDbdOk&t=42.0s)]
