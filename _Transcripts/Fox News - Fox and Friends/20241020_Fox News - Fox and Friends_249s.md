# 'WATERSHED MOMENT': Poll shows Catholic voters prefer Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ)
*  Here to discuss the impact of Catholic voters on this election is the president of Catholic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Vote, Brian Burch. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=5.7s)]
*  We're so glad we got you back up online. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=7.0s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=10.0s)]
*  So let's talk about this because Donald Trump has been, he's not leaving anything on the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=11.08s)]
*  table. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=15.68s)]
*  He's, he's posting prayers to St. Michael. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=16.68s)]
*  He's got the Ave Maria going at rallies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=19.64s)]
*  He's going to the Al's Smith dinner and he's like, you know, just really showing love to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=22.8s)]
*  Catholics. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=28.12s)]
*  And Kamala has nothing going on in that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=29.44s)]
*  And is that a huge mistake? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=31.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=34.36s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=35.36s)]
*  And you know, Kamala Harris has made a massive gamble here, Rachel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=36.36s)]
*  You know, she has calculated that she can build a new political coalition that excludes [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=39.24s)]
*  people of faith, including Catholics. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=44.36s)]
*  And as you know, the Democratic Party has been the home of the majority of Catholic [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  voters for decades. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=51.08s)]
*  And yet what we've seen is on issue after issue over the last several decades, a systematic [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=52.64s)]
*  leaving behind of Catholics to the point where Kamala Harris is essentially now saying, I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=58.0s)]
*  don't, I no longer need you and get out of my way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, in fact, her campaign manager, I mean, she, there's supposedly there was some tussle [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=66.88s)]
*  about why she didn't go and she's blaming her campaign manager. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=71.44s)]
*  And the, in essence, the conversation was about that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=74.84s)]
*  The campaign manager said, hey, this will offend our LGBTQ and our very progressive [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=77.88s)]
*  voters. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=83.64s)]
*  Better you not go. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=84.64s)]
*  So I think your point is well taken. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=86.04s)]
*  I want you to look at this poll. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  This is with Catholics. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=89.48s)]
*  So Harris has 47 to 52 with Trump. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  But here's another interesting poll. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=95.14s)]
*  They're among that's among all Catholics, but white Catholics, 61 percent for Trump, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=97.04s)]
*  only 34 with Hispanic Catholics. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  That's an interesting number, especially as you're seeing Hispanics, men in particular, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=107.2s)]
*  moving towards Donald Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of those numbers? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  Well, we're seeing even better numbers for the president in some of these swing states, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  particularly in the upper Midwest, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where the Catholic [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=118.63999999999999s)]
*  vote makes up nearly 30 percent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=123.0s)]
*  And I think what we might be seeing here, Rachel, is really a watershed moment where [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=125.44s)]
*  this longtime tradition of many Catholics voting for Democrats have finally said, I [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=129.0s)]
*  didn't leave the party, the party left me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=135.24s)]
*  And they are now looking seriously at Donald Trump, not just on a lot of the obviously [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=137.7s)]
*  traditional social issues like life and religious liberty, but on the border, on the economy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=141.28s)]
*  and on, frankly, just our Catholic way of life. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=146.0s)]
*  I think they feel comfortable with with President Trump and they don't feel so with Kamala [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=148.24s)]
*  Harris. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=153.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she's been very aggressive against Catholics, I mean, even as a senator, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=154.08s)]
*  Absolutely. As a U.S. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=159.72s)]
*  senator, she went after a member of the Knights of Columbus. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=161.0s)]
*  She's introduced legislation that would end our Catholic hospitals, our charities. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=164.28s)]
*  She does not believe in religious liberty for Catholics. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  And I think we're waking up to this fact. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=171.08s)]
*  This is a different Democratic Party than what we've seen in the past. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  Very different even from Joe Biden, who at least paid lip service to the Catholic issues [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  and called himself a devout Catholic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=181.4s)]
*  Catholics are kind of tired of being catered to by politicians every four years that come [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=184.24s)]
*  around with this social justice platitudes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=189.56s)]
*  And they've finally said enough is enough. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  We want someone to stand up for us, stand up for what we believe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think right now, President Trump is that choice. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=197.84s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think a lot of Catholics did fall sway to sort of the social justice, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=200.64s)]
*  especially when it came to the border. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=205.2s)]
*  They really wanted to show compassion to the illegal immigrants who were coming over. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=207.04s)]
*  Many of them, as you know, are Catholic, but so many have fallen into exploitation, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  sexual exploitation, the sex trade and even child labor that they're seeing that these [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  so-called progressive, compassionate policies don't actually end up being that way. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=220.92s)]
*  So Brian Burch, great to have you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  Whoever's advising Donald Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  Bravo. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=229.64s)]
*  I mean, he's he's he's hitting all the right notes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=230.04s)]
*  Kamala, pay attention. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2gEcuP9EwQ&t=232.88s)]
