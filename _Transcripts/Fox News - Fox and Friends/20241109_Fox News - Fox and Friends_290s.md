# ‘NEW STANDARD’: Trump’s longform podcasting spurs massive gains with young men
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4)
*  Well the whole election cycle you saw Donald Trump going on podcasts popular with men [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=0.0s)]
*  Attending college football games and campaigning with influencers giving him an edge with those young male voters [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=5.2s)]
*  Well, according to our Fox News voter analysis Trump won with men ages 18 to 44 after they broke for Biden in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=12.08s)]
*  2020 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=19.96s)]
*  Turning point USA founder Charlie Kirk joins us now Charlie. Thanks for being here, you know [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=21.04s)]
*  But it's one thing for a candidate to appeal to young men [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=26.32s)]
*  It's another thing to make sure those young men [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=29.88s)]
*  Vote and I think one of the underlying stories of this election are the efforts of turning point USA [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=32.12s)]
*  Share with us why you think young men turned out for Donald Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=36.96s)]
*  Well first credit to President Trump for actually going to a constituency that should be voting more Republican [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=41.64s)]
*  But wasn't in previous cycles President Trump was unafraid to do long-form podcasting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=47.6s)]
*  The new standard in American politics is if you cannot sit down for three hours uninterrupted with no notes [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=52.14s)]
*  People are not gonna vote for you under the age of 40. That is the new standard gone [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=58.18s)]
*  Are the days of just the scripted, you know meet the press type dialogues for ten minutes voters want to see [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=61.82s)]
*  Authenticity and depth and understanding of the issues, but also, you know, I did 25 campus stops this last [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=67.9s)]
*  Semester and I saw something happening both with men and women [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=74.42s)]
*  It's important to note that young women voted 11 points more for Donald Trump versus 2020 [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=77.26s)]
*  According to an NBC exit poll analysis. That is also a pretty amazing story considering [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=82.62s)]
*  We were told that Kamala Harris was gonna have record margins with young women and young voters [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=87.26s)]
*  So it's really remarkable Pete [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=92.64s)]
*  What we've seen is the younger generation has voted the most Republican and conservative since 2004 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=94.4s)]
*  Young men are the most conservative they've been in nearly 50 years and President Trump deserves [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=100.62s)]
*  Enormous credit for having the wherewithal and the courage to go into communities that otherwise would not traditionally support Republicans [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=106.58s)]
*  No doubt Charlie [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=114.0s)]
*  We're showing images and videos right now of you out on the trail of turning point and colleges and universities [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=115.18s)]
*  But a lot of us have feared for a long time [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=119.38s)]
*  Hey because of our education system because of our colleges and universities, we're gonna lose generations of young men and women to leftism [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=121.26s)]
*  Why are they rejecting that and turning toward Trump? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=128.5s)]
*  Well, there's many reasons we cannot underestimate how this generation was damaged during COVID they had prom graduation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=132.46s)]
*  So many friends taken from them their whole life was uprooted for a disproportionate response towards a younger generation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=139.34s)]
*  They saw on top of that all the excesses of the woke agenda during the summer of 2020 [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=146.02s)]
*  And now they're looking to rebel against that and they say wait a second. We weren't told the truth [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  We were not told the truth about social distancing or the closing of schools [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=155.9s)]
*  Not told the truth about how the virus was going to impact us in the younger generation and they were starting to fight back [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=158.9s)]
*  And President Trump also offered a promise to them [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=164.54s)]
*  You see the younger generation that the first generation since George Washington to have it worse off than their parents [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=167.76s)]
*  They're the most depressed suicidal anxious least likely to own homes least likely to get married least likely to have kids and they want a future [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=173.58s)]
*  And President Trump said you know what Kamala Harris and Joe Biden the Democrats broke it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  I will fix it because the country was stable just four years ago [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  Enough younger voters were able to hear that message. Thanks to the work of him going on podcasting what we did on campuses social media [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=189.78s)]
*  I believe it was that one of the decisive elements that now made President Trump the soon-to-be 47th president the United States for sure [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  Charlie you've been doing a lot. You've been doing spade work on college campuses now for over a decade [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=203.14s)]
*  You've been working on young people trying to remind them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=206.66s)]
*  Where their rights and freedoms really coming from this vote for Trump? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=209.42s)]
*  Is this a Trump vote or is this a young people becoming conservative? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=213.66s)]
*  Is this something that translates to future candidates or is it is it just Donald Trump's unique? Oh [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  It absolutely translates to future candidates [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=222.82s)]
*  And that's what's so amazing is that President Trump is the culmination of a philosophical and worldview shift a realignment [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=225.3s)]
*  If you will where young people increasingly do not want the sad and depressing and heavy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=232.28s)]
*  worldview that we see on the left instead they want the country that their parents were always talking about and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=237.94s)]
*  Another important element is Gen Z is largely the kids of Gen X and Gen X was the most [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=242.86s)]
*  Republican generation that we saw so Gen X and Gen Z are kind of married to each other where Millennials and boomers are married to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=249.26s)]
*  Each other in some ways not married [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=256.3s)]
*  But you know they're they're coupled with each other and so you're seeing as Gen X and Gen Z become more conservative [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=257.42s)]
*  That is going to mean a profoundly more Republican country and a mandate for us to be able to advance freedom and liberty [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=262.38s)]
*  Bad news for the Democrats this week. It's really important as the history of 2024 election is written you and turning point [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=269.18s)]
*  I'll have a big big chapter in it Charlie. Thank you for joining us really appreciate it. I'm Steve. Ducey [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e-xxpFfJY4&t=275.54s)]
