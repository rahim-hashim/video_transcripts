# Trump on Elon Musk campaigning for him: He knows 'we're finished' if I lose
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE)
*  We know Pennsylvania, Michigan, two very important states. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=0.0s)]
*  It looks like this might come down to Pennsylvania. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=3.74s)]
*  Elon Musk has been there campaigning for you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=5.82s)]
*  Why do you think he is so vocal and such an avid supporter? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=8.06s)]
*  Well, he said that if we don't win, this country is finished. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  He actually says it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=14.14s)]
*  He says, you know, they are the threat to democracy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=14.94s)]
*  They're all about sound bites. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=18.38s)]
*  These people are sick. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=20.02s)]
*  They have people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=21.46s)]
*  You know, I talk about the enemy from within. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=22.46s)]
*  What person wants to have open borders? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=25.5s)]
*  What person wants to have men playing in women's sports? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=27.96s)]
*  All of this stuff, it doesn't make sense. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=31.36s)]
*  It's no good. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=33.08s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=33.64s)]
*  But they have an open border. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=34.72s)]
*  They're going to always have an open border. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=36.72s)]
*  So they let 21 million people into our country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=39.08s)]
*  Of the 21 million, 13,000 were murderers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=42.44s)]
*  13,000 and 99, to be exact. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=46.16s)]
*  Drug dealers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=48.88s)]
*  And this is all over the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=49.64s)]
*  This isn't just South America. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=50.88s)]
*  Drug dealers came in. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Everybody's coming in. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=53.92s)]
*  They emptied their jails from all over the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=55.32s)]
*  They emptied their jails into our beautiful country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=57.56s)]
*  We have a problem. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=61.34s)]
*  I mean, you know, we have to straighten it out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=62.46s)]
*  We have to get these people out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=64.02s)]
*  They emptied jails from all over the world. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=65.58s)]
*  Jails. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=68.26s)]
*  In those jails, you have dealers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  You have murderers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=71.42s)]
*  You have gang members. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=72.3s)]
*  They took all their gangs in Venezuela, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=73.7s)]
*  dumped them into the United States. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=75.62s)]
*  You know, Venezuela crime is down 72% [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=77.1s)]
*  because their criminals are in the United States. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=80.5s)]
*  And it's going down further. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isv04k4fnWE&t=82.5s)]
