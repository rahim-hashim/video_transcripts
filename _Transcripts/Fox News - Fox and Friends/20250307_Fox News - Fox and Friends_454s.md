# 'I'M FREAKING OUT': Chilling texts revealed from inside Idaho college murder house
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0)
*  New evidence in the Idaho murders trial, officials releasing chilling text messages that were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=0.0s)]
*  sent the night excuse me, the night an intruder stabbed four college students to death. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=7.26s)]
*  Chandley Painter has all the details for us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=12.86s)]
*  Chandley. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=14.94s)]
*  Good morning Ainsley. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=15.94s)]
*  So we are learning in newly unsealed court documents that both surviving roommates in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=16.94s)]
*  that off-campus home were seemingly awake as a masked intruder murdered four of their [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=21.96s)]
*  friends. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=27.34s)]
*  With the two texting minutes after, one desperately trying to contact the victims writing quote [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=28.34s)]
*  no one is answering. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=33.78s)]
*  The text exchange goes on to read in part quote I'm not kidding I'm so freaked out so [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=35.18s)]
*  am I. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=40.1s)]
*  My phone is going to die. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=41.1s)]
*  Come to my room run down here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=42.96s)]
*  One of those roommates has previously been identified as the only eyewitness who saw [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=46.06s)]
*  the intruder a masked man with quote quote bushy eyebrows. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  Her statements along with these texts and security footage from next door are helping [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=55.22s)]
*  build a timeline for prosecutors of when the suspect arrived to that home. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=59.5s)]
*  The court also releasing a transcript of the 911 call. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=64.76s)]
*  Multiple people appear to frantically explain that they found one of their victims unresponsive. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=69.38s)]
*  That 911 call not taking place until noon the next day. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=74.86s)]
*  So while prosecutors are asking the court to allow all this evidence in against suspect [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=78.42s)]
*  Brian Kober during his trial, the defense wants to prevent the use of that phrase bushy [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=82.9s)]
*  eyebrows to describe the intruder because get this they believe it could bias the jury [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=88.5s)]
*  against him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=94.42s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=95.42s)]
*  All right, Shanley. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=96.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=97.42s)]
*  Let's bring in Greg Jarrett our Fox News legal analyst to talk about this case. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=98.42s)]
*  Hey Greg. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  Hi Ainsley. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  Well thanks for coming on. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  When I read these text messages and you're the father of two girls, I can't imagine what [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  they're going through. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=110.62s)]
*  I know that someone's in the house. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=111.62s)]
*  One of them cracked open the door, saw him with the mask on, the bushy eyebrows and text [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=113.06s)]
*  her friend, my phone's about to die. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=118.18s)]
*  Can you come down to my bedroom? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=119.62s)]
*  I'm terrified that someone's in our house. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine what that feels like. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  And then to wake up and know that your friends have been murdered. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=125.18s)]
*  What stands out to you in this case and will they be dropping charges against Brian? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=128.38s)]
*  No, the charges will remain. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=132.9s)]
*  I assure you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=136.78s)]
*  It's a pretty compelling case that prosecutors have put together against the accused. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=137.78s)]
*  And these text messages are important because the defense had challenged the account given [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  to police by one of the surviving roommates have seen an intruder. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=151.68s)]
*  Well, these text messages show that she told her roommate the exact same thing literally [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=156.14s)]
*  minutes after the murder. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=163.48s)]
*  So it's strong corroboration. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=165.94s)]
*  And remember, there's not only DNA evidence connecting Kohlberger to the killings, but [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=169.46s)]
*  they also have cell phone tower records that place him at or near the scene of the crime [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=176.14s)]
*  right around the time of the murder. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=183.38s)]
*  So the defense is trying to do everything they can to knock out everything, including [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=186.18s)]
*  saying it's unfair. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=193.3s)]
*  He's on the autism spectrum. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=194.3s)]
*  That's just in the end, not going to wash. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=197.34s)]
*  You still can't kill people if he is found guilty. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=199.58s)]
*  All right, Greg, let's talk about this case in Kansas City, Missouri, where those three [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=202.34s)]
*  men in their thirties were found frozen to death outside while their friend who they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  were watching the Kansas City Chief games with game with was inside. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  And so that guy, his name is Jordan Willis. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=215.22000000000003s)]
*  He's 39. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=217.86s)]
*  He's a suspect. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=218.86s)]
*  He was just charged two days ago on Wednesday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=219.86s)]
*  And so was the alleged drug dealer, Ivory Carson, who's 42 years old. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=221.94s)]
*  Both of them were charged. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=225.62s)]
*  Why did it take so long, Greg? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=227.54s)]
*  Because this happened January 7th, 2024. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=228.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm always mystified, Ainsley, at how long it takes law enforcement to obtain toxicology [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=231.62s)]
*  results, you know, here about a year. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=241.14s)]
*  But the prosecution's theory is that the three men ingested cocaine mixed with fentanyl that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=244.18s)]
*  caused them to fall asleep, pass out in the extreme cold outdoors where they died of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=249.46s)]
*  cardiac arrest, hypothermia. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  So authorities have charged, properly, I think, the alleged suppliers of the illegal drugs [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=256.66s)]
*  with causing their deaths. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=263.92s)]
*  Under Missouri law, as it is elsewhere, even an unintended death can still be a crime if [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=265.74s)]
*  it's caused by somebody else's negligence. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=271.66s)]
*  And here providing illegal drugs. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=274.58s)]
*  That's the reckless negligent conduct that resulted in death. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=277.5s)]
*  They're presumed innocent. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=281.74s)]
*  They'll have a chance to make their case at trial. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=283.62s)]
*  All right, Greg, thank you so much for coming on with us. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=285.78s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=287.98s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=290.06s)]
*  Thanks, Ainsley. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=291.06s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=292.06s)]
*  Chilling text messages between the two surviving roommates of the University of Idaho murders [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=293.06s)]
*  now being revealed for the first time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=298.3s)]
*  This sheds light on the deaths of their four friends. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=300.68s)]
*  This is a little bit hard to stomach, but we need to see it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=303.38s)]
*  Dan Springer live in Seattle. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=306.1s)]
*  Hi, Dan. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=307.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=308.5s)]
*  Hi, Dana. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=309.5s)]
*  As Brian Koberger's trial gets closer through court documents, we're starting to get more [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=310.5s)]
*  details surrounding that gruesome early morning in November 2022 in Idaho. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  Six students were sleeping in this house just off the University of Idaho campus. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=319.82000000000005s)]
*  It was a little after 4 a.m. when one of the roommates heard noises and three times she [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=323.94s)]
*  looked out her bedroom door. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=328.44s)]
*  The last time she found herself a few feet away from a man wearing all black and a dark [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=329.86s)]
*  Minutes later, Dylan Mortenson was back in her room frantically calling and texting all [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=335.78s)]
*  of her roommates. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=340.46s)]
*  Only Bethany Funk responded. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=341.9s)]
*  No one is answering. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=343.82s)]
*  She says, I'm really confused. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=344.82s)]
*  She wrote to Bethany, then trying another roommate, Kaylee, what's going on? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=346.6s)]
*  Bethany texts back, confused. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=350.86s)]
*  Zanna was wearing all black. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=352.98s)]
*  Dylan, I'm really freaking out. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=354.9s)]
*  No, it's like a ski mask almost. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=356.98s)]
*  It continues like he had something over his head and mouth. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=359.22s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=362.86s)]
*  I'm so freaked out. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=363.94s)]
*  Then Bethany says, come to my room. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=364.94s)]
*  Run down here. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=367.58s)]
*  The chilly messages all have been kept from the public. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=369.06s)]
*  But now we know that both surviving roommates will testify at the trial, which is scheduled [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=372.94s)]
*  to start in five months. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=377.08s)]
*  The text will help prosecutors establish a timeline down to the minute. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=378.64s)]
*  Almost eight hours later at noon, 911 call is finally made from the home from one of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=383.5s)]
*  the girl's phones. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=388.18s)]
*  It was chaotic as the phone was being passed around to several people. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=389.48s)]
*  The dispatcher is trying to get clarity, and she finally hears one of our roommates [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=392.66s)]
*  who's passed out, and she was drunk last night. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=397.02000000000004s)]
*  She's not waking up. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=399.82000000000005s)]
*  Then a different woman says, oh, and they saw a man in their house last night. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=401.22s)]
*  Now prosecutors say that man was Brian Kohlberger, who at the time was a criminology grad student [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  at nearby Washington State University. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=412.42s)]
*  He's facing four counts of first degree murder and the possibility that the death penalty [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  will be executed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=419.62s)]
*  In another motion recently filed, his attorneys argued that the death penalty should be taken [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=421.22s)]
*  off the table because Kohlberger is autistic. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=425.68s)]
*  The state has yet to respond to that motion, but the judge on the case, Stephen Hippler, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=429.16s)]
*  has already ruled after a series of challenges that Kohlberger is eligible to face execution. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yo4xrbKtU0&t=433.06s)]
