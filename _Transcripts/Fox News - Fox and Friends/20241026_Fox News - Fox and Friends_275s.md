# Trump on Rogan: If I were a Democrat, I would get a lot of positive press
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o)
*  We're just 10 days out from the election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=0.0s)]
*  The race is tighter than ever with Trump and Harris locked in a tie in a recent national [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=3.6s)]
*  poll that uncertainty spilling over into print media. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The Washington Post declaring it's returning to its roots of not endorsing presidential [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=11.0s)]
*  candidates. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=15.84s)]
*  A decision reportedly made by post owner Jeff Bezos. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=16.84s)]
*  I thought democracy died in darkness, but the move follows other papers, including those [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=21.2s)]
*  from Harris and Walz's own home state. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=26.0s)]
*  You've got the LA Times and the Minneapolis Star Tribune refusing to endorse. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=28.72s)]
*  Here with reaction Republican political analyst and campaign strategist Ford O'Connell. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=34.44s)]
*  Ford, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=38.16s)]
*  I think it would be fair to say, I'll go ahead and include you in this, although Ford [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=39.64s)]
*  you can tell me if I'm wrong, none of us care about the endorsement of the New York [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=43.04s)]
*  Times, the Washington Post or the Los Angeles Times. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  But people that I know do care would be Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=48.76s)]
*  What does it mean that they're not getting the endorsement of some really big newspapers [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=53.86s)]
*  like the LA Times or the Washington Post? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=58.24s)]
*  It means that the race is slipping away and that Trump is firing on all cylinders. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=61.52s)]
*  He's out working Kamala Harris at every turn on the campaign trail. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=65.76s)]
*  And frankly, he's going up in all the polls. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you just look at that latest New York Times, seeing a poll, it says that they're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=71.76s)]
*  tied. Well, just two weeks ago, Harris was up by three. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=75.76s)]
*  And to put this in perspective, Will, back in 2016 against Hillary Clinton on this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=79.48s)]
*  weekend, she was up five points nationally. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=84.64s)]
*  So this is a big deal all around. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=86.96s)]
*  Things are trending in Trump's direction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  You go ahead. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=91.6s)]
*  No, when you say trending in Trump's direction, what states are you looking at right [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=92.24s)]
*  now? We're going to we're going to have this conversation a lot in the next 10 days. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=95.24s)]
*  But where are trends the most dramatic in what states? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=97.8s)]
*  Well, let me put it this way, Pete. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=102.44s)]
*  He's actually leading in the real clear politics average at all seven of the swing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=104.44s)]
*  states where he appears strongest right now is in the Sun Belt and the states of North [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=108.24s)]
*  Carolina, Georgia, Arizona. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=112.52s)]
*  And actually, right now, in early voting, it appears he's actually leading in Nevada [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=114.52s)]
*  as well. Obviously, he's going to have to pick off one of the blue wall states, whether [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=118.0s)]
*  it's Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=122.16s)]
*  Right now, it appears that Harris is leading in the early vote in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=124.84s)]
*  But let me tell you, it's going to be really, really close in all three of those states. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=128.64s)]
*  But I do think the momentum is on Trump's side. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=132.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=135.0s)]
*  It's interesting. Like she starts going out and doing more interviews and her poll [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=136.2s)]
*  numbers start to slip as people start to see and hear more from her. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=141.44s)]
*  On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who's saying, I don't need to do any more [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=146.24s)]
*  legacy media, although he's done, you know, Fox and Friends and a few other TV shows. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=149.68s)]
*  But mostly he's going out on these podcasts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  For example, last night, making the decision to go for almost three hours on the Joe [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=156.4s)]
*  Rogan podcast. I want you to listen to this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=161.4s)]
*  And then I just want you to tell me what this particular podcast means to the race. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=163.76s)]
*  I got three nominations in a row. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=168.84s)]
*  One the first time did much better the second time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=174.32s)]
*  You know, I get millions of votes more the second time and now I'm doing it a third [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=176.68s)]
*  time. And it's an incredible thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=180.88s)]
*  I never get a good story. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=184.08s)]
*  I only get bad press. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=186.16s)]
*  Now, I will say this. It's a lot easier if you're a Democrat. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=187.88s)]
*  If I were a Democrat, you'd get a lot of positive. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=191.32s)]
*  I would get a lot of positive. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. No, it's a it's a creepy, corrupt business. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=194.76s)]
*  And the media, to a large extent, acts as a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=197.0s)]
*  It's not even believable. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's so interesting, John, because I think what it proves is he can't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  get good press from the legacy media. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  And now there's this whole new thing, which are podcasts, and he can go on for three [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=211.12s)]
*  hours and show who he really is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  Is this going to impact the race? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=217.32s)]
*  I absolutely think it will. And I think it's a genius move. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=220.0s)]
*  I think the only thing that was just as smart as going on the Joe Rogan podcast was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  serving up fries at McDonald's while Kamala Harris is dishing out lies. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=226.8s)]
*  These are political goals. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=230.68s)]
*  Now, for the viewers to understand, Joe Rogan's podcast goes to young young men, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  particularly young men who are low propensity voters. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=236.72s)]
*  These are the exact people who are going to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=239.12s)]
*  Joe Rogan was initially for RFK Jr., who endorsed Donald Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=241.36s)]
*  He's getting outside the echo chamber and he's going to where the voters are. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  Remember, Rogan's got 15 million people on Spotify and something like 17, 18 [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=249.12s)]
*  million on YouTube. This is golden podcasts. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=253.72000000000003s)]
*  As of right now, will be the future in politics. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=256.68s)]
*  All right, Ford O'Connell, thanks for getting up with us this morning. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=259.56s)]
*  Appreciate your analysis. Appreciate it, guys. Take care. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D5uCNBn1o&t=261.91999999999996s)]
