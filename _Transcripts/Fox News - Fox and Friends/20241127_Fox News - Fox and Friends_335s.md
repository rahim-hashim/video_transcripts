# ‘BULLS---‘: Harris campaign blames bad questions for interview snafus
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M)
*  So, when you want to give, like, an interview after, you know, give a post-mortem, you think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=0.0s)]
*  you would go to a traditional media outlet, that way they can ask some, you know, tough [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=4.76s)]
*  questions. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=9.44s)]
*  Instead, the Obama crew that ran Kamala Harris' campaign went to the Obama Bros., which were [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=10.44s)]
*  the speechwriters, the comms team. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Pod Save America. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=18.8s)]
*  Pod Save America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=19.8s)]
*  And this is what they had to say. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=21.0s)]
*  We would do an interview, and the questions were small and processy and about, like... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=23.92s)]
*  Dumb. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=30.92s)]
*  Just dumb. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=31.92s)]
*  They were not informing a voter who was trying to listen to learn more or to understand. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=32.92s)]
*  That does a disservice to voters, and being up against a narrative that we weren't doing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  anything or we were afraid to have interviews is complete **** and also, like, took hold [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=43.24s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=48.86s)]
*  And we just gave us another thing we had to fight back for that Trump never had to worry [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=49.86s)]
*  about. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=53.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, everyone could look back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=54.32s)]
*  This is the time, to be honest, is the only time... [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=57.68s)]
*  You have nothing to lose. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=59.92s)]
*  ...you get into that mode of midterms. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=60.92s)]
*  But when she says she blames the people for asking small questions, that is the funniest [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=62.2s)]
*  thing I've ever heard in my life. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=67.18s)]
*  I blame the friendly questions that we got from friendly journalists... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=68.68s)]
*  Layups. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=72.64s)]
*  ...where 77% of all the...your coverage was positive, where something like 85% of all [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=73.64s)]
*  Trump's was negative, and you blame the questions. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=79.18s)]
*  If you get a question of, what is it going to take to win? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=82.64s)]
*  That's all I need. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=85.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=86.28s)]
*  Because if I know what it takes to win and what my vision is, thank you for the easy [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=87.28s)]
*  question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=90.2s)]
*  I will take advantage of it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=91.2s)]
*  You know it with your book interviews. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=92.36s)]
*  If someone says, tell me about Under His Wings, you can't be like, what a bad question. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=93.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=97.32s)]
*  You say, okay, I'm going to tell you about the content of it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=98.32s)]
*  It is an opportunity to show yourself. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=100.68s)]
*  And what she missed is an opportunity to hop on the podcast and keep on debating the Joe [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=103.32s)]
*  Rogan podcast. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=107.2s)]
*  It's the format. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=108.76s)]
*  The format is, I'm not really going to ask you about what you did or Joe Biden. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=109.76s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=114.76s)]
*  And are you comfortable talking besides recipes, who else makes you up? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=116.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=120.76s)]
*  Why did you get married late? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=121.76s)]
*  What went into those decisions? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  What was it like growing up in San Francisco with a single parent? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  So that's when you have an opportunity over the course of three hours to show your personality. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=129.52s)]
*  Trump did it, but the format worked for Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=134.16s)]
*  Andrew Schultz and these guys, they were funny. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=136.68s)]
*  He's when he's his best. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=139.04s)]
*  He's self-effacing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=140.04s)]
*  So if you are self-effacing and you have a degree of humility, that's why you love the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=141.32s)]
*  format. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=145.48s)]
*  And then you hop in with 60 Minutes, you answer some questions circuitously, and they make [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=146.48s)]
*  you seem smart. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=151.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=152.92s)]
*  They edit your answers, and you're still complaining, and you were scared to do an interview. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=153.92s)]
*  Don't lie about it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=158.88s)]
*  You didn't put her in front of the cameras until after the DNC. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  So true. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=164.32s)]
*  Emily, they blamed Trump, actually, when it came to the... [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=165.32s)]
*  They said, look, they were actually trying to do the interview that same day that Trump [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=168.0s)]
*  did it in Houston, but they just really couldn't make it work. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=172.04s)]
*  It's to Brian's point, though, they really didn't want to do the interview. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=176.48s)]
*  There were people within the campaign staff that didn't think that she was shine A. And [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=179.66s)]
*  number two, as James Carville made it very clear, the young people on the campaign, you [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=184.12s)]
*  know, the crazy, you know, blue hair, purple hair. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=189.2s)]
*  They said, don't do Rogan. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=192.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=193.72s)]
*  And the thing is, for someone that effectively attempted to have us believe in her as a leader, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=194.88s)]
*  and by the way, she was the current vice president this entire time, and yet remains unchallenged. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=200.24s)]
*  To your point about all of these interviews, everything she said was never challenged. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=205.66s)]
*  She never had a follow-up question. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=210.06s)]
*  Contrast that with President Trump during a debate where everyone said it was three-on-one. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=212.36s)]
*  Everything he said was challenged, twisted, manipulated, and pushed back. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=216.28s)]
*  She had every softball, every option, every opportunity, every time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=219.8s)]
*  And yet she wants us to believe that she's the victim, that the scheduling didn't work [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=223.86s)]
*  out, that she can't make something work, and yet you want me to put my faith in you as [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  a commander-in-chief? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=230.62s)]
*  You think I can trust you with the nuclear codes, with diplomacy, with representing me [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  on the national and global stage, and you can't even articulate the answer to a softball [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  question as to economic policy or why you flip-flopped? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  She should have never did the rally in Houston. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  There was no shot in winning Texas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=247.9s)]
*  There was absolutely no shot. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  It would have been more beneficial to the campaign to do the interview than do that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=251.46s)]
*  rally in Texas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  They had this, just like the poll that was released days before Iowa, there was no shot [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=259.18s)]
*  in winning Iowa. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=265.5s)]
*  Everyone knew it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=267.02s)]
*  It was an outlier. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=268.02s)]
*  Instead, they wanted the voters. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=269.02s)]
*  They said the same thing about Florida. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=270.74s)]
*  There's a shot. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=272.38s)]
*  We're seeing some movement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=273.38s)]
*  Ron DeSantis has dominated in Florida for the last election cycle. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=274.38s)]
*  He's dominated in terms and his governor's race. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=280.1s)]
*  There was no data to suggest that they had a path there, but they were telling people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=283.54s)]
*  this to try to excite. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  Just like at the convention, Brian, they said there's so much joy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=290.22s)]
*  There was no joy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  No one liked her. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=294.38s)]
*  We saw it in every swing state when she lost every single swing state. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=295.86s)]
*  I think there's a lot there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=301.5s)]
*  I just think that finally the question that destroyed her campaign, and everyone agrees, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  How are you different than Joe Biden? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=308.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=309.9s)]
*  By Sonny Hoss? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=310.9s)]
*  In retrospect, the questions were too simple. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=312.82s)]
*  You can't get simpler than that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=315.62s)]
*  If you can't hit an underhand pitch, why should I give you a fastball? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=317.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=321.38s)]
*  You're nailing it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFMvagOH5M&t=322.38s)]
