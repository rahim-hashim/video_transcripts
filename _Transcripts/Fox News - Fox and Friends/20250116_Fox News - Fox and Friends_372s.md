# Laura Ingraham: This reminds us of why the Democrats lost in 2024
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA)
*  Today, Pam Bondi's confirmation hearing for attorney general continues with testimony [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=0.0s)]
*  from additional witnesses after explosive moments with some of the Democrats on the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=7.04s)]
*  Hill yesterday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=11.72s)]
*  Are you aware of any factual basis to investigate Liz Cheney? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=13.56s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=17.52s)]
*  Senator, that's a hypothetical, and I'm not going to answer that question. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=18.52s)]
*  No, no, it's not a hypothetical. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=21.72s)]
*  I will never play politics. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=22.72s)]
*  You're trying to engage me in a gotcha. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I won't play politics with any ongoing investigation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=26.76s)]
*  You say the right things, that you're going to be the people's lawyer. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  That's what you have to say to be here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=36.52s)]
*  You said that I have to sit up here and say these things. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=39.52s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  I sit up here and speak the truth. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=43.86s)]
*  Boom. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  The host of the Ingram angle, Laura Ingram joins us now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=48.56s)]
*  How good was she? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=51.72s)]
*  She held her own, didn't she? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=52.72s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=54.32s)]
*  Pam Bondi demonstrated not only in her answers to these insipid, backward looking questions, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=55.32s)]
*  but in her entire performance, she elicited from the Democrats all of the comments that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=62.36s)]
*  remind us of why the Democrats lost in 2024. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=69.2s)]
*  They are not focused on the issues that Americans care about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  They're talking about Liz Cheney, who couldn't win in her own district. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=76.86s)]
*  They're focusing on the 2020 election, and they're focusing on the weaponization of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=82.0s)]
*  FBI after they spent the last nine years using government influence to try to put Donald [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  Trump in prison. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, I'm watching this going, have these people learned anything? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=102.48s)]
*  Pam Bondi is going to sail through, and frankly, the Democrats on the committee just embarrassed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=104.2s)]
*  themselves and showed absolutely zero ability to reflect on their own failures and the failure [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=109.54s)]
*  of their party overall. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=116.42s)]
*  When Adam Schiff was asking about Liz Cheney, she said, you're so worried about Cheney and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=118.5s)]
*  that you should be worried about the crime rate in California. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  I loved that moment. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=126.94000000000001s)]
*  And Maisie Hirono, she said, I tried to meet with you and you wouldn't take my meeting. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=128.3s)]
*  What kind of stood out for you, Laura? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=134.06s)]
*  Well, I think, again, Adam Schiff, of course, now senator of a state that is losing population, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=135.54s)]
*  that is suffering from incompetent leadership, that is a crime-ridden overrun with illegal [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  aliens, can't manage to prepare when they know severe winds are going to present massive [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  dangers to entire communities. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  They have no preparation in place. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  And Adam Schiff spends his time focusing with Pam Bondi on the 2020 election and whether [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=161.38s)]
*  she's going to be Donald Trump's henchman against Liz Cheney. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=170.56s)]
*  Pam Bondi was attorney general of one of the most successful states in the United States. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  And Adam Schiff represents one of the states that is most in crisis in our country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  It tells the story of politics today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump represents the people's interests and the Democrats are mired back into radical [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=188.7s)]
*  politics that has not created a single job or saved a single life. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=200.1s)]
*  And Pam Bondi, stellar, as was Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, it's competence versus a total [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=201.1s)]
*  lack of credibility on the other side. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=207.06s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  I was watching your show last night and you were talking about Biden's farewell address [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  and what to expect. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=213.22s)]
*  You were asking your guests. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=214.22s)]
*  Well, he gave that speech after your show last night at eight o'clock. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=215.66s)]
*  Here's a clip of that and we'll get your reaction on the other side. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  This is a dangerous constant and that's a dangerous concentration of power in the hands [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=222.5s)]
*  of a very few ultra wealthy people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=229.77999999999997s)]
*  Today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=235.7s)]
*  literally threatens our entire democracy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=241.82s)]
*  What did you think, Laura? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=245.02s)]
*  Okay, this is unwitting comedy on the part of Joe Biden. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=246.02s)]
*  His policies of globalization, all the trade policies that he supported over the last 50 [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=251.62s)]
*  years, the WTO in China, outsourcing jobs, all of that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=258.54s)]
*  These were Joe Biden's policies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=263.74s)]
*  He's the one who famously said the rise of China is not a threat to us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  Now he's complaining that we've created all these billionaires in the United States? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=269.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=274.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=275.18s)]
*  Five minutes ago he was working with the high tech industry to try to censor conservatives [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=276.18s)]
*  and he's mad now because that's for the most part, not completely, but for the most part [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=281.3s)]
*  that's been minimized. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  What they wanted was the voices of opposition shut down Ainslie and they looked to high [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=289.42s)]
*  tech to do that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=295.26000000000005s)]
*  But again, when you look at all the most wealthy enclaves in the United States that apparently [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=296.86s)]
*  he's complaining about, Greenwich, Connecticut, Brentwood in California, Cambridge in Massachusetts, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=301.58s)]
*  Bethesda, Maryland, not too far from where I am right now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=308.14s)]
*  Who represents those districts? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=311.14s)]
*  Who represents those states? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=313.54s)]
*  Liberals. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=315.46s)]
*  So if Joe Biden is upset that all these wealthy people are out there influencing politics, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=316.46s)]
*  who's to blame for that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=323.94s)]
*  Joe Biden, his party's to blame for that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=325.74s)]
*  So I found the speech, I mean, again, it was embarrassing, it was sad for the country, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=328.28s)]
*  but in 50 years, Ainslie, there are going to be a thousand books written about Elon [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  Musk and Donald Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=338.08s)]
*  Biographies, there will be zero written about Joe Biden. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=344.76s)]
*  All right, Laura, thank you so much for waking up with us this morning. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=345.76s)]
*  Great to see you guys. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=348.28s)]
*  I hope to see you in Washington this weekend. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=349.55999999999995s)]
*  We'll do it for sure. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=352.11999999999995s)]
*  And I'd only get up in the morning this early for my kids or Fox and Friends. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=353.11999999999995s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=357.64s)]
*  Thank you so much, Laura. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=359.64s)]
*  Take care. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPAppRunbA&t=360.64s)]
