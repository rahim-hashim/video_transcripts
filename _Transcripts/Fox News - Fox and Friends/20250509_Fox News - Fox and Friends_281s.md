# Democrats are 'never' going to get over this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw)
*  I wasn't surprised because they went the route of the sexist route, the whole route. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a woman, she's this, she's that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=6.24s)]
*  Really, I've never seen quite as successful and a consistent campaign undercutting the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=9.76s)]
*  notion that a woman couldn't lead the country and a woman of mixed race. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=17.6s)]
*  What? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=22.8s)]
*  What country is he in? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=24.12s)]
*  Here to react, Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  What was anti-woman about the Trump campaign? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=28.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=30.9s)]
*  I mean, Brian, it's like they're never going to get over this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=31.9s)]
*  They're never going to be able to move on because they refuse to accept the reality [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=37.3s)]
*  of the 2024 campaign for the Democrats. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=42.08s)]
*  On the issues, whether it was the economy or them pushing this trans insanity or taking [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=45.34s)]
*  away parental rights and then taking their nominee off of the campaign trail with very [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=50.46s)]
*  little transparency and explanation and then plugging in Kamala Harris and demanding that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=55.86s)]
*  not just the American people accept that, but Democrats who thought that they had a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=61.82s)]
*  primary and voted for Joe Biden to be the nominee now had to move forward and accept [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=66.06s)]
*  that this was a new person they were going to get behind and act like it was all authentic. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=71.5s)]
*  I mean, they keep talking in ways that just are in denial of the facts around what happened [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=75.66s)]
*  during the 2024 election. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=83.22s)]
*  And more importantly, you're seeing Joe Biden on the view yesterday, denying again that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=85.18s)]
*  he had any kind of cognitive decline. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=91.66s)]
*  Jill Biden jumps in to help answer questions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=93.94s)]
*  Oh, you want to hear it, Katie? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=96.66s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=97.66s)]
*  Which doesn't help them make that argument. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=98.66s)]
*  Yeah, let's show it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=99.66s)]
*  Let's show it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=100.66s)]
*  Because everyone was watching the pope and outnumbered yesterday. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=101.66s)]
*  We taped it on our VCR. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  Here's that moment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=105.7s)]
*  Are these sources wrong? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=107.9s)]
*  They are wrong. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=108.9s)]
*  There's nothing to sustain that, number one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=111.02s)]
*  Number two, you know, think of what we're left with. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  And so we went to work and we got it done. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things that, well, I'm talking about. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=121.38s)]
*  Well, and, Elissa, you know, one of the things I think is that the people who wrote those [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=126.66s)]
*  books were not in the White House with us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=131.78s)]
*  And they didn't see how hard Joe worked every single day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=134.94s)]
*  Katie, sources. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=140.54s)]
*  You don't have to work in the White House with Ron Klender on biography. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=142.5s)]
*  Sources from the White House filling up four books talking about how out of it he was. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, and these books are a year late, two years late. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=152.42s)]
*  I mean, I covered the Biden White House and we were watching what was happening. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=157.33999999999997s)]
*  We knew exactly what was going on. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=161.16s)]
*  And yet you still yesterday have the Biden team lying to the American people about the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=163.38s)]
*  way that the Bidens covered up the president's condition, the way that the White House staff [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=169.26s)]
*  covered up the condition. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they were calling lids, which means end of the day at nine a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=174.98s)]
*  regularly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  They were hiding the president from the American public. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=181.54s)]
*  And all of a sudden, when they had that June debate, it was like the emperor had no clothes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  Everybody in the country could then see what was happening, which is why they quickly took [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=188.26s)]
*  him off of the campaign trail. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=193.22s)]
*  And they made the point that, look, Joe can't win. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=195.22s)]
*  And yet they plugged in a new candidate who couldn't win either. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=198.78s)]
*  And they continue the cover up that's going to keep the Democrats in this political hole [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=202.02s)]
*  that they can't get out of until they recognize the problem and that they were really dishonest, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=206.34s)]
*  not just with their own party, but with the very voters they're trying to get to put him [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=211.02s)]
*  to put Kamala Harris into the White House for Democrats. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=216.1s)]
*  They could have a second shot at power. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=218.82s)]
*  I mean, it's absurd how they just can't get over this idea that the facts show that Joe [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=221.38s)]
*  Biden was declining. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=226.9s)]
*  They're continuing to lie about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=227.98s)]
*  I mean, the Robert Herr report, as you know, special counsel Robert Herr didn't charge Joe [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  Biden with the felony, saying in black and white in dozens of pages they didn't charge [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=234.26s)]
*  him because they thought that a jury would consider him an old man with a bad memory. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=239.66s)]
*  I mean, and they didn't release the transcript or the audio of that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=244.62s)]
*  Maybe we'll see that from this Justice Department. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=249.54s)]
*  But until Democrats accept and admit what they did in the cover up of this, they're going [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=251.54s)]
*  to have a hard time getting credibility back with people that need to get them back in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=256.82s)]
*  office. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=259.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=260.74s)]
*  And the administration's got a big decision to make if they're going to release those [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=261.74s)]
*  tapes. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=262.98s)]
*  I've read the whole transcript. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=263.98s)]
*  It looks awful for Joe Biden. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3Ag-Rx_sw&t=264.98s)]
