*  said when you left the hospital, that's when you knew he wasn't coming home. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=64.48s)]
*  What did receiving this award from Frank, from his organization, what did that mean [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=68.44s)]
*  to you? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=73.32s)]

*  Tunnel to Towers and Frank, they were one of the first people there for me and Ryan [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=76.44s)]
*  when this all happened. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=82.72s)]
*  And I remember Frank coming to my house and just giving me a big hug. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=85.16s)]
*  He came with like five coffees because he didn't know what kind of coffee I liked. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=90.32s)]
*  And it just, you know, in a really dark time, he lifted me up and the organization has been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=94.56s)]
*  lifting me and my family up ever since. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=100.72s)]
*  And I just, I'm so grateful and it's an absolute honor to have accepted that award last night. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're seeing these images of you at your husband's funeral. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=107.28s)]
*  It was a massive funeral. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=110.28s)]
*  They brought the coffin out, lift high, the cross was playing, which is one of all of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=112.36s)]
*  our favorite songs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=115.72s)]
*  This image we shouldn't see. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't see a mom with her newborn baby or her toddler and without a husband to go [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=118.18s)]
*  home to. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=123.34s)]
*  How are y'all making it and how's your son doing? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=124.34s)]
*  You know, we take it day by day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  And one thing I said last night is through this tragedy, we will not live a tragic life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=129.4s)]
*  And I want Ryan to have the best life. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=134.04s)]
*  He's going to know his dad. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=136.62s)]
*  He's going to know his dad is in his heart. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=137.62s)]
*  He's going to know him through stories, through all of the people who Jonathan loved and loved [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=138.96s)]
*  him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=143.76s)]
*  And, you know, we have each other always. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=144.76s)]
*  He always has me and I always have him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  And we get each other through the day. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  And we have our village, our family, our friends, and we couldn't do it without them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=150.84s)]
*  Frank, I know you decided which family would receive this honor. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  How did you decide Stephanie's story? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=159.2s)]
*  Because you have so many. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=160.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, we'll do for any first responder in America that dies on line of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=162.0s)]
*  duty and leaves a young family behind. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=166.64s)]
*  But you know, this rocked America. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=168.44s)]
*  This wasn't just a New York story. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=170.7s)]
*  You know, police officers shot and killed by somebody that should not have been on the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  street. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=176.2s)]
*  And, you know. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=177.2s)]
*  Twenty priors, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=178.2s)]
*  Allegedly, twenty priors? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=179.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's both of them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  You think about, you know, her son, Ryan, was nine months at the time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  And last night at the Patriot Awards, my nephew, my brother Stephen, you know, Tunnel to Towers, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Stephen Sill, Tunnel to Towers Foundation, young Stephen Jr. handed over the award to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=194.6s)]
*  Stephanie. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=201.32s)]
*  Which gave you hope, Stephanie. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=202.32s)]
*  You said, seeing you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=203.32s)]
*  My nephew was nine months old when his father died. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  And Ryan was nine months. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=208.32s)]
*  And, you know, I just is, there's so much pain out there, but you are so strong in the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=210.88s)]
*  message you are sending about you're not going to have a tragic life. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=216.32s)]
*  You're going to have a life that a legacy for Jonathan, your husband and your son. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=220.28s)]
*  You're going to teach him the way to live like the both of you would have together. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=226.32s)]
*  Of course, you're going to miss him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=229.8s)]
*  But you are quite an inspiration, young lady. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=230.84s)]
*  Well, so he was stopped. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=234.28s)]
*  So he walked up to a car, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=235.42s)]
*  And his car was stopped at a bus stop illegally parked. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=237.48s)]
*  And he was trying to get their attention. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, you got to move your car. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=242.64s)]
*  And the guy shot him below his bulletproof vest. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=244.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=247.28s)]
*  And there's another guy in the car. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=248.28s)]
*  Both of them had long wrap sheets. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=249.28s)]
*  Have you I won't ask you too much because I know it's under investigation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  But has that ever been explained? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  Why were they out on the street? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=257.24s)]
*  I mean, these are two men who should have never been out on the street. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=259.52s)]
*  You know, if they weren't there, then Jonathan would still be here with us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=264.24s)]
*  And if it wasn't Jonathan that day, then it could have been somebody else. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=267.68s)]
*  And somebody else's family would have been destroyed that in that moment. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=271.48s)]
*  And, you know, if we don't change the way it is now, then it will be somebody else. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=275.36s)]
*  And that that would break my heart. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  What do you think about last night? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  What does the flag mean to you? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  And being surrounded by so many people who love you and love your family and support [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=284.68s)]
*  you, and even Donald Trump. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  I always say that thank you is not the right word because there is no word I can use to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=290.76s)]
*  express how thankful I am for the support and the love that Ryan and I have received. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=296.8s)]
*  And you know, this was a very this was the darkest thing that has ever happened to my [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=302.68s)]
*  family. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=309.04s)]
*  And through it, we have seen so much light. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=310.04s)]
*  I've you know, I've met people like Frank and just the community, Long Island, the entire [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=312.64s)]
*  nation really rallied all around me and Ryan. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=317.68s)]
*  And it just gave me a sense that there is so much good in the world despite the bad. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=321.8s)]
*  And that's who Jonathan was. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=327.04s)]
*  And so the spirit of Jonathan just continues. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=329.24s)]
*  And I see that and through all these wonderful things and support. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=332.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I know you're not ready, but I hope at one point in your life, you're so [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=335.36s)]

*  Thank you for your sacrifice. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSpBAyckYXY&t=342.20000000000005s)]
