# 'Stupidest stat ever!': Obama fact-checked after DNC speech
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA)
*  Economists estimate up to one million jobs could just vanish in this morning's job revisions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=0.0s)]
*  because they were over counted. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=7.0s)]
*  That pokes holes in the Biden administration's narrative that the economy is strong. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=9.42s)]
*  And as today's jobs numbers make clear, Bidenomics is working. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=14.72s)]
*  And today we have the strongest economy in the world. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=20.2s)]
*  The lowest inflation rate among the major economies. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=24.66s)]
*  13.5 million new jobs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=28.64s)]
*  So we're seeing a steady and stable growth as we have been talking about for some time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=31.12s)]
*  And we're seeing that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=34.96s)]
*  That's what we believe the jobs numbers showed us just last week. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=35.96s)]
*  So joining us now is co-host of the Big Money Show on Fox Business, Brian Bremberg. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=39.4s)]
*  Brian, what are we expecting today at 2 o'clock? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=44.64s)]
*  So here's what happens. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=46.44s)]
*  Every month they estimate how many jobs that we get, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=47.44s)]
*  But those are estimates. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=50.24s)]
*  And so you've probably noticed each month you get a little revision to the previous [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  month's number. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=55.44s)]
*  Well now, this right now, you're going to get an entire revision to the last year's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=56.76s)]
*  numbers and that could mean we overstated our jobs by a million because the surveys, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=62.16s)]
*  the estimates were wrong. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=68.56s)]
*  The problem is politicians- [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=70.28s)]
*  Look at this, we really overestimated them four times. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=72.6s)]
*  And it happens almost every month. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=75.64s)]
*  But the point is Americans are always saying, I don't feel as good as these jobs numbers [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=77.32s)]
*  are telling us or the politicians are telling us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=83.08s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=86.12s)]
*  Your gut is probably right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=87.44s)]
*  The numbers we're getting month after month are not quite right, even though the politicians [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  want to tell you they're right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=95.56s)]
*  How will this affect the Federal Reserve? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=97.44s)]
*  How will it affect interest rates? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=99.36s)]
*  Well that's the problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  So the Federal Reserve says we look at the data to determine how to change interest rates [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  and they're now saying, ooh, the data might have been way off. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  The economy might not be quite as strong as we thought. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=109.56s)]
*  So if this revision is like a negative one million, that might mean the Federal Reserve [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=113.56s)]
*  has to cut interest rates more and earlier than they thought. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=118.8s)]
*  So you could see interest rates come down faster if in fact the jobs picture is weaker [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=122.88s)]
*  than we thought it was. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=128.04s)]
*  Some economists at Goldman Sachs say that they expect it could be a million. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=129.28s)]
*  Could be half a million to a million, yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=132.92s)]
*  Yeah, all right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=134.72s)]
*  We'll get those numbers at 10 o'clock. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=135.72s)]
*  So Barack Obama was on stage at the DNC yesterday and he's touting that same number that they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=136.76s)]
*  continuously spout out, the 15 million jobs that they've created. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=141.84s)]
*  You laugh, you said it's the stupidest statistic ever. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=145.68s)]
*  Listen to what Barack Obama said. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=148.96s)]
*  At a time when our economy was reeling, we needed a leader with the determination to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=152.44s)]
*  drive what would become the world's strongest recovery. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  15 million jobs, higher wages, lower health care costs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  So where is he off to? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=167.4s)]
*  They shut down the economy, OK? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=168.4s)]
*  You know, millions of jobs immediately shut down and then, you know, the powers that be [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=170.76s)]
*  let us go back to work again and they count those jobs as job gains under Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  It's absolutely ridiculous. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=182.04s)]
*  It is a flat out lie. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=183.64s)]
*  They tell it repeatedly and they use it as like this part of their platform. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=185.78s)]
*  You know, when they're fact checking the economy, they use this number. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=190.32s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=194.28s)]
*  Barack Obama knows better. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=195.28s)]
*  Biden knows better. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=196.28s)]
*  Harris knows better. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=197.28s)]
*  Everybody knows better. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=198.48s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=200.56s)]
*  That's what I meant by stupid. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=201.56s)]
*  That's what I meant by stupid. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  OK, you can watch Brian today, the Big Money Show. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=204.11999999999998s)]
*  It is on the week. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=207.72s)]
*  It's during the weekday and it's at one o'clock on Fox Business. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-j7ViS_RA&t=208.95999999999998s)]
