# 'PROTECT WOMEN'S SPORTS': Volleyball coach loses job over transgender athlete fight
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo)
*  In November, then San Jose State Assistant Volleyball coach Melissa Beaty Smoose filed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=0.0s)]
*  a Title IX complaint against the school over its handling of a trans player on the women's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=7.24s)]
*  team. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=12.72s)]
*  The school then suspended her and this week her contract officially expired. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=13.72s)]
*  Now they are not rehiring her. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now with her side of the story is Melissa Beaty Smoose. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=21.96s)]
*  You know, Melissa, I can only imagine what it must have been like for you when you first [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=26.96s)]
*  went to San Jose. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=32.44s)]
*  You probably never dreamed that you were going to wind up in a fight over trying to prevent [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=34.1s)]
*  a biological male from being in the locker room with your players and traveling and rooming [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=40.96s)]
*  with female players on the female volleyball team. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=49.96s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=54.36s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=55.76s)]
*  It's kind of crazy to think that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=56.76s)]
*  How did we get here? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=59.44s)]
*  Yeah I moved my family here two years ago across the country from Connecticut and you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=62.68s)]
*  know this was never told to me in advance and I was supposed to continue to recruit [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=68.3s)]
*  new student athletes and lie to their families and as I'm building relationships with them [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=74.16s)]
*  and their parents. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=80.88s)]
*  It's just been a long two years and you know just standing up for what's right and making [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=82.72s)]
*  sure we're continuing to support women and women's sports is you know what I stood up [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=91.0s)]
*  for and now currently after 30 years in my career have been let go. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=98.2s)]
*  So I want to play a clip from the co-captain of the team, Brooke Slusser talked to Fox [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=105.58s)]
*  Digital earlier. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  Oh it's a quote. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=114.06s)]
*  So she said, you can't truly voice how you're feeling without them just trying to cover [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=116.96s)]
*  it up. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=122.42s)]
*  With Melissa you could voice how you felt and you could comfort you and validate your [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=123.42s)]
*  feelings and at least make you feel heard. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=128.62s)]
*  So you really did wind up kind of in a position of being the only sane person in the situation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=132.56s)]
*  Yes correct. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=141.76s)]
*  And obviously the students were you know what's the most shocking part of all of this is the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=143.86s)]
*  fact that normal adults aren't standing up for these I mean they're teenagers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  The people around them were not supporting them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=158.04s)]
*  The administration, the athletic department, the head coach were all protecting the male [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  and pretty much gaslighting everybody involved. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=167.04s)]
*  It was very you know tough situation for all of them very traumatic that what they had [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=171.88s)]
*  to go through and it's unfortunate they have four years to play collegiate volleyball and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  you know their last two years were affected so much and not being able to play some of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=185.16s)]
*  their matches. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=190.56s)]
*  Was San Jose State says that they are unable to comment on the situation but you know it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=193.56s)]
*  looks like you know the Trump administration has decided to actually to reverse Joe Biden's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=199.44s)]
*  twisting of the Title IX program to basically return common sense by enforcing the idea [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=208.64s)]
*  that Title IX applies to actual women. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=216.27999999999997s)]
*  Step in the right direction I think. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=218.88s)]
*  Yes it's a great first step in the right direction. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=221.44s)]
*  Now we need to continue it and it has to become the laws change and the NCAA get to make those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=224.32s)]
*  changes necessary so that we save women's sports and that we continue to you know have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=231.92s)]
*  women's sports. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  Well I think that the only reason there has been a return of some common sense is because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=241.0s)]
*  of people like you standing up and saying this is insane and it can't go on so we thank [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  you very much for that Melissa and thank you for joining us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  Yes thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=253.0s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrX1McE1mo&t=254.0s)]
