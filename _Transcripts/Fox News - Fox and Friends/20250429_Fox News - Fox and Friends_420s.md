*  Comedian Matt Friend making millions laugh online with his celebrity impersonation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's right, as we mark 100 days of Trump 2.0, and he's even spoofing this viral moment [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  of the president getting hit in his face with a microphone while taking reporter questions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=11.44s)]
*  Remember this? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=16.96s)]
*  A reporter hit Donald Trump in the face with a microphone, but Trump's reaction was surprise [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=17.96s)]
*  us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=28.06s)]
*  It's going to be a big news story for her. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=31.06s)]
*  Matt, she joins us right on the Kirby couch. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=35.06s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=37.06s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=38.06s)]
*  Unbelievable to be here with the cast, to get out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=39.06s)]
*  I am thrilled. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=40.7s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=41.7s)]
*  How are you guys? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=42.7s)]
*  Good to see you all. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=43.7s)]
*  My man, how are you? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=44.7s)]
*  Oh my god, I'm thrilled to be back here, honestly. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=45.7s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=47.9s)]
*  It's been 100 days since Trump has last seen Melania. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=48.9s)]
*  My god, no seriously. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=51.86s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=52.86s)]
*  He was with her in the batting. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=53.86s)]
*  He was. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=56.3s)]
*  By the way, the pope did die. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=57.3s)]
*  He will likely soon be replaced by an older white man. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=58.66s)]
*  So that means Democrats will soon try to replace him with Kamala Harris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  But anyways. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=65.42s)]
*  By the way, Bernie Sanders at Coachella, what was going on there? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=66.42s)]
*  Bernie, imagine you're a 12-year-old kid who wants to dance and then you just hear, we [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=71.14s)]
*  are in danger. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=75.9s)]
*  There is an existential threat facing our democracy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=77.56s)]
*  No one wants to see that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=81.62s)]
*  I didn't think so. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=82.62s)]
*  I'm imagining Mitch comes out just as it's thrilling to be here at Coachella with all [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=83.94s)]
*  these young people. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=87.98s)]
*  There's several issues in our country facing us today. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=91.22s)]
*  You can come on Fox and have a good time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=94.22s)]
*  Thrilled to be here though, honestly. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  Well, I would say that's a big one too, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  Well, let me just begin by saying, did you all get my signal message? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  Did you get that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=110.06s)]
*  It is great to be back on Fox. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=112.06s)]
*  There's a lot of tremendous, look at these viewers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=113.94s)]
*  They're great people, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=115.78s)]
*  They're fantastic. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=116.78s)]
*  That's a tough guy and if he could kill me, that guy, that's a big one. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=118.34s)]
*  But it is so great to be on Fox. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=122.26s)]
*  It's a great country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of problems, but I'm running the world and I'm running the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  You can ask. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=129.02s)]
*  Failing 60 minutes, which nobody's watching. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=130.02s)]
*  We love Bill Belichick. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=132.46s)]
*  What a hot girlfriend he's got, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=134.22s)]
*  She's a hot one, but she's dating. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=137.06s)]
*  She's troubled too. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  She's troubled. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  Bill Belichick's a great guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=141.89999999999998s)]
*  I know Bill very well and you got to talk about a lot of random things when you do him, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=143.17999999999998s)]
*  But it's a bipartisan, I just do the Trump impression. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=148.7s)]
*  I'm basically just saying things that he's already said. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  They're like, are you making fun of him? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, no, he just said it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  This morning. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, Matt, and we were just talking to Bill and Dana about the terrorists. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  How is Trump explaining the terrorists to people? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, listen, you know, that's a great question. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=163.54s)]
*  Very proud of you for that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=165.82s)]
*  Well, you know, there's problems in this country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=168.94s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden, he's falling asleep like a dog. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=171.58s)]
*  It's totally true. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=174.86s)]
*  And that's why we have a lot of problems in this country, because you got to fix the prices. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=176.94s)]
*  There's so many problems with the prices, the eggs, the freezing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=181.58s)]
*  Women are freezing eggs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  That's what they're freezing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=186.78s)]
*  The eggs, there's none left. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=187.9s)]
*  They're going to freeze them, which is sad. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=188.9s)]
*  There are no eggs for Easter. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's no more Easter eggs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=193.06s)]
*  And I know Easter very well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  I know a lot of people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=195.38s)]
*  I know all the founders of these great religions. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=196.66s)]
*  And the fact is, there's problems. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=200.94s)]
*  So you're going to tariff these people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=203.26s)]
*  And I know these people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=204.86s)]
*  Look at this blonde. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=205.82s)]
*  She's a great blonde, too. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=206.54s)]
*  She's honestly so attractive, Sean, if you're watching, I'm so sorry. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=208.86s)]
*  But she is a beauty. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=212.02s)]
*  She's a beauty. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  And that is honesty. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=215.34s)]
*  I said it last at my favorite African American. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  He is such a great African American. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=219.02s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=221.86s)]
*  It is. Look at him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=223.22s)]
*  He's just standing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=224.3s)]
*  He's just looking. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=225.22s)]
*  Mr. President, if you're watching, tell me you didn't think the exact same thing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=226.54s)]
*  this morning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=230.18s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=231.42s)]
*  If the president is watching right now, we all have his number. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=232.58s)]
*  He should call one of our phones. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=238.22s)]
*  Oh my God, that would be alarming. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=239.5s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=240.98s)]
*  It would be. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=241.66s)]
*  Have you ever talked to the president? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=242.5s)]
*  I have not. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=244.74s)]
*  No. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=245.54s)]
*  Have you? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=246.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=246.9s)]
*  It was actually me the whole time on the phone. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=247.42s)]
*  So I don't think that you have. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=250.14s)]
*  He used to be on our show every Monday. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=252.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=254.26s)]
*  I'm so glad I'm here, though, because the correspondence dinner just happened. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=255.74s)]
*  Not anybody was watching, in case you noticed, but we need comedy in this country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=258.66s)]
*  I mean, even Bill Maher went to the White House. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=262.94s)]
*  Oh, and it was such a controversy, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=267.42s)]
*  And I'm here to set the record straight and say, and finally, new rule, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=270.3s)]
*  we're making the country laugh. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=274.38s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=276.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=277.22s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=279.22s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=280.34s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=281.58s)]
*  You don't even need time to warm up. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=283.38s)]
*  You just go straight into it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=286.54s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  That's why I'm doing shows, because it's important to laugh. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=287.46s)]
*  Remember the Johnny Carson era, where the country could laugh together? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=289.98s)]
*  I think it's a good thing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=292.7s)]
*  My dad misses that show. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=294.18s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=295.54s)]
*  He said, I can't watch any of the late night shows anymore except for that show. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=296.1s)]

*  You all know who that was, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=301.9s)]
*  We love it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=303.38s)]
*  OK, how old were you when you started doing impersonations of your parents? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=304.42s)]
*  I was four years old when I watched Austin Powers, and that's what got me to self. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=307.26s)]
*  And what was it? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=311.06s)]

*  I only really do Dr. Evil. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=314.42s)]
*  I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called Mr. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=316.1s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  So it was just about the little pinky up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=320.82s)]
*  And now I'm doing Ted Cruz for some reason. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=322.26s)]
*  So I've come a long way from doing Dr. Evil to Ted Cruz. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=324.66s)]
*  I don't know how that happened. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIEiZlqgdWc&t=329.78000000000003s)]
