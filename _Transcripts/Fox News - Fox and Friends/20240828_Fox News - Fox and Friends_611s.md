# Kamala Harris' flip-flops stun 'Fox & Friends': 'Sad'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM)
*  First and foremost, it looks like the president, the vice president is going to sit down for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=0.0s)]
*  an interview before the end of the month, like she promised. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=5.24s)]
*  It'll be tomorrow and it'll be with our running mate. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=7.4s)]
*  A lot of speculation on why. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=9.96s)]
*  The campus saying, well, we go, Governor Walz and Kamala Harris just got a chance to meet [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=11.88s)]
*  each other. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=15.96s)]
*  Doesn't really understand all the nuances of what she stands for and what she's running [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=16.96s)]
*  on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=21.32s)]
*  That makes two of them because she doesn't seem to understand or reiterate that in specifics. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=22.32s)]
*  Anyway, so they're going to sit down with Dana Bash on CNN and it's going to be a taped [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=26.28s)]
*  interview. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=30.8s)]
*  I just don't understand why he can't watch the interview just like the rest of us and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=31.8s)]
*  learn as well. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=34.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=35.08s)]
*  I mean, the notion that they have to go on together. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=36.08s)]
*  You think it looks bad next to him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=37.08s)]
*  Together story straight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=39.2s)]
*  We know why he can watch the interview, learn the policy and start regurgitating the new [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=40.2s)]
*  talking point. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=45.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=46.2s)]
*  They're on a bus together. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=47.2s)]
*  You think it would come up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=48.2s)]
*  She's been interviewed a lot in the past as vice president and she has the word salads. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=49.2s)]
*  It's very she's very confused. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=54.2s)]
*  She gets caught off guard, especially when they talked about the border. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=55.98s)]
*  I think that if she has her running mate sitting next to her, they're both going to be prepped [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  and he can hop in when he sees she's going down the wrong path and vice versa. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=64.5s)]
*  They have a lot to explain. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=68.06s)]
*  So in other words, he essentially is her co-host. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=70.66s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=74.66s)]
*  Her TV husband. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=75.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  She is going to have to explain her policy shifts. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  Her campaign is now flip-flopping. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=80.42s)]
*  Does she agree with her campaign? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=82.58s)]
*  Is she actually flip-flopping? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=84.14s)]
*  We need to hear how she stands or where she stands on these issues. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=85.58s)]
*  And did she know Joe Biden's mental decline? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=88.74s)]
*  And then Waltz is going to have to talk about his military service because many are calling [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=90.86s)]
*  that stolen valor. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=95.44s)]
*  He claimed to be something that he wasn't. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=96.44s)]
*  He also said he got this award from the Chamber of Commerce, which never happened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=97.86s)]
*  Nebraska. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=101.42s)]
*  They asked him to take that off his website and his left wing policies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=102.42s)]
*  So they're going to be interviewed by CNN. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=106.06s)]
*  Dana Bash is going to do the interview. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=108.9s)]
*  She got the exclusive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=110.52s)]
*  Everybody's going to be watching it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=111.52s)]
*  You've got to wonder why she wound up with it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=113.78s)]
*  Well, as it turns out, she's done three interviews with Kamala Harris before. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  In 2020, she said that she had a conversation about Bill Barr living in a different reality [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=122.42s)]
*  than once they were elected. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=130.02s)]
*  Dana Bash is the first person who interviewed Kamala Harris after she was elected and the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=133.3s)]
*  first person who interviewed her after the Roe v. Wade thing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=137.5s)]
*  So you've got to figure out the Kamala Harris team thought, okay, she was fair before, she'll [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=141.16s)]
*  be fair now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  So one of the things she's going to be asked about is the economy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  When you look at 2019, this is what she supported. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=149.64s)]
*  She supported the Green New Deal, which includes a federal job guarantee. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=152.2s)]
*  Not only that, she co-sponsored it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=156.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=158.96s)]
*  But now the campaign says that she no longer supports a federal job guarantee. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=159.96s)]
*  This is the campaign, not her. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=164.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=166.0s)]
*  When it comes to energy, she endorsed, we all heard her say over and over, she's going [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=167.0s)]
*  to ban fracking, oil and gas fracking. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=170.28s)]
*  Well, that was in 2019. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=172.32s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=174.24s)]
*  2024, now the campaign says she does not support a total ban on fracking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=175.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=180.32s)]
*  But this whole thing with federal land and then expanding federal land where you can't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=181.32s)]
*  drill and frack, that is a subtle way of banning it, shadow banning it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=184.04s)]
*  When it comes to health care, she supported Medicare for All. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=188.2s)]
*  Then she said, did I say that? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=190.88s)]
*  I didn't mean that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=192.2s)]
*  The campaign says she will not push Medicare for All. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=193.2s)]
*  Why do you even ask? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=195.76s)]
*  And when it comes to crime, she was going to be tough. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=196.76s)]
*  progressive prosecutor looking to end cash bail, having a real big heart for the criminal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=198.68s)]
*  Now she designed a campaign as a pragmatic prosecutor, taking on predators and fraudsters. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=203.8s)]
*  And I would just say this, there's a downside because there's a lot of a party who want [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  the no cash bail, who want to be easy on it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=214.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, it was Donald Trump who did the criminal justice reform. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=217.16s)]
*  This next one, that was the biggest, that was the latest flip flop. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=223.88s)]
*  She went down to the border wall in 2019. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=225.12s)]
*  She called it a medieval vanity project and she said it was a waste of taxpayer money. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=226.6s)]
*  She said on The View. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=232.04s)]
*  Now, apparently in 2024, she vows to allocate millions of dollars to continue building the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=233.44s)]
*  wall by supporting the border bill, her administration, negotiating. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=238.12s)]
*  So Brian, I think yesterday you kind of teased this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=241.96s)]
*  It was only going to be a matter of time before she said build the wall. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=245.44s)]
*  So when she came out and said, I am for no taxing on tips, I was flabbergasted. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=248.92s)]
*  And I, and I think other people after we just have the luxury of doing the morning [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=254.48s)]
*  show beyond first, I go, what's next? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=257.4s)]
*  Is she going to be for the border wall? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=259.2s)]
*  It was only a week away. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=260.76s)]
*  We also said she'd be wearing a red mega hat soon. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=265.44s)]
*  And there she is on the New York Post. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=267.96s)]
*  Of course, that is a Photoshop. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=269.92s)]
*  We should add a little, we should add some context to her current standing about the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=272.24s)]
*  wall and stuff like that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=279.64s)]
*  Axio said what she supports is the bipartisan border bill, which was going through the Senate, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=281.24s)]
*  which does not have any new money to continue building the walls. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=288.8s)]
*  It simply extends the timeline to spend the money from the Trump years. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=293.48s)]
*  There is no, this new legislation has restrictions to make sure that apparently no wall is built, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  but barriers are built. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=303.56s)]
*  So that's the fine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=305.24s)]
*  So basically, millions of dollars were appropriated under Donald Trump for the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=306.24s)]
*  border wall. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=311.2s)]
*  We just heard the man on Fox and Friends First who said all those, all the parts of the wall [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=312.2s)]
*  are still on my property. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=317.2s)]
*  They're just sitting there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Four years later, he says, why are these materials still on my property? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=320.12s)]
*  The wall was paused. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=324.36s)]
*  Now she's saying all that money, the millions of dollars that were allocated for the wall, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=326.52s)]
*  now I'm going to use all of that money. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=330.52s)]
*  We're going to build a wall. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=332.0s)]
*  And 53% of the public when asked are now for the wall. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=333.28s)]
*  In 2016, that number is in the low 40s. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=336.56s)]
*  And most of them were Republicans. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=339.52s)]
*  They were for Trump and some Republicans say we don't really need that wall, even though [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=341.0s)]
*  George W. Bush did a ton of it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=344.16s)]
*  And Bill Clinton also built a ton of the wall. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=346.08s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid used to be for it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=348.52s)]
*  But when Donald Trump ran on it, they had a problem with it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=350.88s)]
*  Then we found out, I don't know, the wall works. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=353.2s)]
*  So now they want to build it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=355.9s)]
*  So what Tom Homan said yesterday was so on the money. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=357.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=360.12s)]
*  It's on the ground. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=361.12s)]
*  You saw it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=362.12s)]
*  You can see the video. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=363.12s)]
*  Even the equipment needed is sitting there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=364.12s)]
*  We're paying for it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=366.06s)]
*  Start tomorrow. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=367.24s)]
*  The technology that is there as well is rotting in the back. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=368.24s)]
*  It's already been paid for, by the way. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=372.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=373.6s)]
*  And that was in the bipartisan border bill that we've heard so much about that did not [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=374.6s)]
*  get passed. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=378.12s)]
*  Anyway, nonetheless, we have put together a little montage of where she has said she's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=379.12s)]
*  against that wall through the years. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=385.0s)]
*  And we thought we'd show it to you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=387.52s)]
*  She had Paul Anko sing this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  On the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=394.84s)]
*  And he has held up the United States government and its workers around his vanity project [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=399.28s)]
*  called a wall. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=405.88s)]
*  This president's medieval vanity project called a wall. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=407.2s)]
*  And for him, he talks about that wall. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  He wants everyone to be preoccupied with his billion dollar, multi-billion dollar vanity [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  project. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  This issue is about a vanity project for this president. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=422.64s)]
*  And I think that's how she's going to be able to explain this pivot on Thursday of going [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=423.64s)]
*  back and forth. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=428.0s)]
*  And I think that's the risk that this interview is going to do. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=429.0s)]
*  Like everyone keeps trying to explain when it comes to her campaign and her surrogates, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=431.76s)]
*  the evolution of her position. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=436.36s)]
*  She's going to have to explain it in great detail. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=438.8s)]
*  And she can't depend on the running mate to do that because she's going to look incredibly [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=441.08s)]
*  weak. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=445.24s)]
*  I know this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=446.24s)]
*  He was a really strong surrogate for Joe Biden. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=447.24s)]
*  Joe Biden was looked at by his own party as too old to work. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=449.8s)]
*  So he was sidelined. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=454.44s)]
*  So he'll be strong. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=456.24s)]
*  I mean, he gets his side. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=457.24s)]
*  He'll be on out of he'll know how to back her up. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=458.48s)]
*  But the other thing to keep in mind is the E.V. mandates. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=461.04s)]
*  She also says she wants to mandate electric vehicles. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=463.5s)]
*  And she says is over and over again. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  And now she does not want an E.V. mandate, which is affects dealerships. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=468.44s)]
*  Of course, it affects Michigan and Ohio. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=473.34000000000003s)]
*  So she wanted everyone. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=477.24s)]
*  She wanted everyone to drive an E.V. by the year 2030. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=478.8s)]
*  Yeah, 2030, 2034. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=481.8s)]
*  We need more electricity for that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=482.8s)]
*  That's a huge problem. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=485.32s)]
*  You go to these dealerships, see your friends, you should ask them. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=486.32s)]
*  The dealerships, they're forced to absorb. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=489.6s)]
*  They're forced to absorb these electric vehicles. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=491.6s)]
*  Nobody wants them. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=493.68s)]
*  Well, the all electric Todd, the car guy doesn't sell all electric for the most part, but he [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=494.68s)]
*  does sell hybrids. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=499.76s)]
*  That's what people want. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=500.88s)]
*  They want the hybrid. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=501.88s)]
*  They like the fact that well, yeah, because it runs on gas. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=502.88s)]
*  So to your point, it's going to be really interesting to see what she says, because [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=505.62s)]
*  politicians flip flop all the time, all the time. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=508.62s)]
*  Not on every issue. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=511.74s)]
*  Well, you know, and not take the other guy's issue. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=512.74s)]
*  For survival. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=515.82s)]
*  It's human nature. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=516.82s)]
*  People are trying. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=518.32s)]
*  She wants to be president. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=519.32s)]
*  So she looks at this stuff, Brian, your point where 53 percent support border security. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=520.32s)]
*  The question is why? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=524.98s)]
*  Why did she change her mind? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=527.86s)]
*  Also, how long has she felt this way? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=529.7s)]
*  And when she was working with Joe Biden, did she ever say, hey, Joe, we're wrong about [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=531.86s)]
*  this? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=535.74s)]
*  These are questions they need to know because we want to know. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=536.74s)]
*  But she's a sitting vice president. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=539.62s)]
*  Can you imagine if Hillary Clinton goes, I'd like to build the wall. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=540.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=544.0200000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=545.0200000000001s)]
*  You're trying to build the wall. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=546.0200000000001s)]
*  You kidding me? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=547.0200000000001s)]
*  You're going to build a wall? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=548.0200000000001s)]
*  The only thing she did is she realized that the TPP was very unpopular and she sided with [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=549.0200000000001s)]
*  Trump on that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=553.74s)]
*  That's about the only thing that you think Joe Biden took any of Donald Trump's ideas? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=554.74s)]
*  Zero. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=558.7s)]
*  How sad is it, though? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=559.7s)]
*  We're at a point in our country where we have a presidential election and one of the candidates, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=560.7s)]
*  the whole campaign is telling her, you need to be someone that you're not. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=565.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=568.4s)]
*  The other guy. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=569.4s)]
*  You got to be your opponent. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=570.4s)]
*  And she's, okay, okay, I want to win. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=571.4s)]
*  Just get over the finish line and then you can do what you want. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=573.96s)]
*  Everyone is like, oh, they're going to be afraid. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=577.52s)]
*  They're going to be upset about that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=579.88s)]
*  They're not. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=580.88s)]
*  They just want her to win. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=581.88s)]
*  They know that she gets elected. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=582.88s)]
*  Then she can sneak in these progressive policies. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=583.88s)]
*  And that's why she's saying all this new stuff. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=587.92s)]
*  Just to get elected. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=590.08s)]
*  Just to get elected. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=591.16s)]
*  We've never seen anything like this. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=592.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=593.16s)]
*  Tomorrow night's show on CNN with him being interviewed, maybe it's going to be a comedy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSjAwYfxgM&t=594.16s)]
