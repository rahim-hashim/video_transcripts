# Peter Doocy: Trump isn't giving an inch with this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo)
*  All right, the art of the deal is on full display as President Trump says he will not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=0.0s)]
*  drop his proposed tariffs just to get China to the negotiating table. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=6.44s)]
*  It comes as he announces new plans for tariffs on all foreign made movies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=10.46s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us with the details. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=15.32s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning and as we've seen over the last couple of weeks, the point of these tariffs [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=19.6s)]
*  really is to try to get the whole world against China and unfair trading practices by the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=23.64s)]
*  Chinese over the last couple of years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=29.44s)]
*  So as President Trump says, the big trade deals with big trade partners could be announced [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=30.96s)]
*  soon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=36.44s)]
*  He is not giving an inch to get Beijing talking. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=37.44s)]
*  At some point I'm going to lower him because otherwise you could never do business with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=41.88s)]
*  him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=45.04s)]
*  And they want to do business very much. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Look, their economy is really doing badly. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Their economy is collapsing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=51.24s)]
*  And then this is new, a Hollywood angle. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=53.6s)]
*  The president writes other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our film [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  makers and studios away from the United States. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=59.4s)]
*  Hollywood and many other areas within the United States are being devastated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=62.08s)]
*  This is a concerted effort by other nations and therefore a national security threat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=65.4s)]
*  It is in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=70.34s)]
*  We want movies made in America again. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=73.28s)]
*  That is why he is proposing a 100 percent tariff on movies that are made outside the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=75.64s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=80.22s)]
*  We know the president has got appointed ambassadors to Hollywood, including John Voight and Mel [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=81.22s)]
*  Gibson and Sylvester Stallone. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  But we also know this year's highest grossing film so far, the Minecraft movie, was shot [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=87.92s)]
*  in the UK and Canada. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=92.76s)]
*  Other nations, a lot of them, have stolen our movie industry. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=96.68s)]
*  And I'm saying if they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States, then we [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=100.12s)]
*  should have a tariff on movies that come in. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=106.04s)]
*  And not only that, governments are actually giving big money. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=108.84s)]
*  I mean, they're supporting them financially. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=111.56s)]
*  So that's sort of a threat to our country in a sense. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Now we wait to see how studios and theater chains might be impacted ahead of this year's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=118.06s)]
*  biggest expected grossing film, which comes out in two weeks. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=125.86s)]
*  That is the final installation of the Mission Impossible franchise, which was shot basically [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=129.54000000000002s)]
*  everywhere else in the world except the United States. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  But Peter, does he acknowledge that the industry did it to themselves? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, with all the ridiculous constraints and the taxes and the regulation? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=142.5s)]
*  No, this possible Trump-Hollywood rescue plan is basically an acknowledgement that California [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=149.5s)]
*  used to have the best tax incentives, but the rest of the world came in low. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=158.18s)]
*  It's kind of like with every other industry that he's been talking about since Liberation Day. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=161.74s)]
*  The whole rest of the world figured out ways to just come in lower, do stuff for cheaper [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=166.58s)]
*  and that is what's happening. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  But we also know there's a big lead up to this even within the United States. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=173.94s)]
*  I believe that the stat is that Georgia produces more movies now than California and TV shows [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=178.78s)]
*  than California. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=185.77999999999997s)]
*  And so it's not just a Hollywood thing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=186.77999999999997s)]
*  There are other places in the United States that make movies, but a 100% tariff on stuff [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=190.42s)]
*  that gets made elsewhere is going to make the Oscars very different in a couple of years. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=194.7s)]
*  It is true, Peter, because after liberal Hollywood did that, you had Texas, Georgia, as well [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=201.34s)]
*  as Tennessee offer no taxes essentially on these companies to come to their southern [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=208.26s)]
*  states to make the movies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=215.86s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see how it's all going to play out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=217.3s)]
*  Thanks so much, Peter. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=219.26s)]
*  And all that we needed was a president to install themselves as the head of the Kennedy [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=220.26s)]
*  Center. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  He's now surrounded by a lot of lines of DC's art scenes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  So now that's what you get. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=230.06s)]
*  Well, Peter, it'd be great if the movies, most of the movies that we watch are made [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=231.78s)]
*  here in America. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=235.58s)]
*  These towns make a lot of money when the industries come in. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=236.86s)]
*  But how does this really affect most of us? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=239.58s)]
*  Most of us are not in Hollywood and involved in making movies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=241.9s)]
*  We could audition more. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=244.82s)]
*  Like when we get done, we have the whole day in front of us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=245.82s)]
*  And say that a big TV show or a movie wants to go and shoot in a town, that brings hundreds [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=248.82s)]
*  of people to the hotels and the restaurants and the shops. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=254.9s)]
*  And so it's a huge economic boon to the places that get picked to make a movie. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=258.06s)]
*  And they, President Trump is saying just do it here and you can do it for cheaper or at [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=264.5s)]
*  least you can sell the movie for cheaper later. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=269.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=271.46s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=272.46s)]
*  I mean, they do the floor. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=273.46s)]
*  Fox does the floor in Ireland. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=274.46s)]
*  With Rob Lowe. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=277.46s)]
*  I've never watched it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=279.66s)]
*  Yeah, but just know it's on and they choose to go instead of using the Fox lot. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=280.66s)]
*  It's more affordable to do it in Ireland. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=284.74s)]
*  Couldn't they just make it look like scenes in Ireland and just show parts of the movie? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=286.3s)]
*  Ireland is just so it's cost effective to go over there. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=291.62s)]
*  Well, it might not be now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=295.42s)]
*  If they want Americans to watch it, it's going to be 100 percent tariff. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=296.62s)]
*  But if everything's more expensive, how are you going to make it? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=299.82s)]
*  Like the budget might not be there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  I just don't like special exemptions for Hollywood. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=304.22s)]
*  If the president has set this stance that we're all in this together and every industry [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=306.54s)]
*  encourage to make things here, build here, make all your products here, then Hollywood [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=311.54s)]
*  shouldn't be exempt. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=316.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=317.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=318.62s)]
*  Charles Payne, you had a great interview with him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=319.62s)]
*  He was fired up this morning talking about student loans and about this issue. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=320.62s)]
*  He yelled at me the whole time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=324.38s)]
*  Here he is explaining the film industry. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=325.38s)]
*  I think the subsidies is where we can have, you know, OK, if it's the same way China subsidized [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=328.66s)]
*  steel, right, to get all of the steel and at some point they control all of it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=334.54s)]
*  We don't have any steel factories and then they can hike up the prices and we have zero [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=338.38s)]
*  say. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=342.06s)]
*  You know, it's just one of these things. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=343.06s)]
*  It's a massive industry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=344.7s)]
*  Two hundred forty five billion dollars. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=345.7s)]
*  Almost all these countries, New Zealand, Australia, I think Canada, they also sort of subsidize [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=348.06s)]
*  it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  And so it's another it's another import item that's up for play. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  If I had a hundred percent tariff and it cost 20 billion, 20 million, and it would be 40 [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  million, maybe it would be advantageous. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=362.02s)]
*  And New York City was always movies being made here when David Dinkins was mayor. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=363.86s)]
*  I mean, you can make the city, you know, you remember I couldn't walk down a block and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  there wasn't a bunch of trailers and cameras and lights. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=371.3s)]
*  You never run into a movie studio. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=374.14s)]
*  Well, part of the reason is ridiculous regulations. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=377.54s)]
*  You got to have, you know, you have to have LBGQ key grips and the lighting directors [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  got to have had some type of tribulation in their background. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=386.62s)]
*  I mean, it's ridiculous, the restrictions, the politically correct restrictions on these [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=389.86s)]
*  staff. So they go over to Bosnia, they go over to Egypt to do a Middle Eastern movie [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=394.94s)]
*  and they'll say, we don't have a problem. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=400.62s)]
*  We could hire who we want, the best people for the jobs. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=401.98s)]
*  So Hollywood's got to change their criteria. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=404.94s)]
*  Don't you think don't reward that horrible behavior? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=407.58s)]
*  Don't you think a lot of that nonsense is dead now? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=409.98s)]
*  There's been a realignment and there's alternatives where other states that don't make that as [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=412.22s)]
*  a requirement. You can't get an Oscar unless you have a diverse class and and a crow. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=417.34s)]
*  You can't get the best lighting. You can't get the best director. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=423.86s)]
*  You gotta get the most, you gotta diversify. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znGExBZLUzo&t=426.9s)]
