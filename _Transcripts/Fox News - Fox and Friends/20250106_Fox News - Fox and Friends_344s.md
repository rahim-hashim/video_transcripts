# Trump press secretary: This is a 'sucker punch' in Biden's last days
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ)
*  Well, later today on January 6th, Congress is going to certify will certify Mark's President-elect Trump's election results and President Biden wasting no time cementing his far left climate legacy with a last-ditch effort permanently banning off-share drilling in most U.S. waters. Incoming White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt joins us right now. Caroline, good morning to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. Good to see you, Steve. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  It's good to see you. So on the way out in his last two weeks, what he's trying to do is he's trying to slow down Donald Trump, isn't he? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=29.68s)]
*  That's exactly right. This is a disgraceful decision by the Biden administration. And I say the administration because we all know Joe Biden doesn't know what's going on. This isn't him. This is the radical left environmental extremists in his administration who don't care about what's in the best interest of the American people, the American people who just [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=40.28s)]
*  reelected President Trump with a resounding mandate to drill baby drill. This decision, the intent behind it is to exact intact political revenge on the American people and on President Trump to try to slow down his administration and make it harder to implement the agenda that he campaigned on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=59.84s)]
*  But the good news is President Trump is going to get to work today. One, his administration will look at how we can rescind this radical order and expedite permits for drilling and for fracking to bring down the cost of living and energy in this country. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=78.32s)]
*  That's what he campaigned on. And the American people can expect President Trump to deliver on that promise. He will not be deterred. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=91.6s)]
*  Well, and here's the thing, Caroline, apparently a lot of these lands and we're talking about the East Coast, West Coast, the Gulf Coast and up around the Bering Sea. A lot of these areas, gas refineries have not really had any interest in developing anyway. But nonetheless, it's just symbolic. And I know it's going to be challenged in court. And I know that Republicans can change the law. But still, for him to do it in the last two weeks rather than his first two weeks, it speaks volumes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=97.92s)]
*  Mm hmm. It does. As I said, this is the Biden administration simply trying to throw a sucker punch at President Trump on Joe Biden's way out the door. But this is going to be Joe Biden's legacy, not doing what's in the best interest for the American people to bring down the cost of living and inflation that has been robbing them of their hard earned paychecks every week. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=125.12s)]
*  No, it's about throwing stones at those who don't believe in their ideology. It's about being anti Trump, not pro America. But that's all going to change on January 20th. Rest assured. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=144.96s)]
*  And that is exactly two weeks from today. Now, today, January 6th, this is a day when, according to our laws, they've got to certify the presidential election. What is thrown kind of a monkey wrench into things, Caroline, is the fact that it's a snow day in Washington and the federal government technically is closed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=157.08s)]
*  The schools are closed, everybody. But Republican leaders said, hey, members of Congress who are Republicans, make sure you stay in town over the weekend. And most of them did. Democrats left town. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=175.08s)]
*  But nonetheless, it sounds like there will be enough Republicans in the Capitol today to certify the election. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=185.12s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yes, indeed. And they must do so because President Trump received a resounding mandate on November 5th, 312 electoral college votes. He won the popular vote and the American people want him to get to work from two weeks from today. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=193.24s)]
*  So let's certify this election. And then Congress needs to immediately get to work to start drafting a big, beautiful bill that needs to make its way to President Trump's desk as soon as possible. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=207.0s)]
*  He wants one package to make America safe and wealthy again, to include border security measures, more funding for Border Patrol and ICE so that they can hire more people to help implement the mass deportations that President Trump promised. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=217.6s)]
*  And the American people elected him to implement. And this package also needs to include critical tax relief. We must extend the Trump tax cuts and add President Trump's signature campaign promise to end taxes on tips. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=231.16s)]
*  Republicans need to get tough and smart. Stick together. Send this bill to the Resolute Desk. President Trump will be there to sign it in a couple of weeks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  Caroline, I got to ask you one more question because you just brought up something that was brand new news last night, and that is President Trump has thrown his weight behind this idea of just one bill, one big, beautiful bill by Memorial Day. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=252.04s)]
*  I know there are a lot of top Republicans who have said it's going to be two bills because you want to get border and you want to get energy done real fast. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  But taxes are going to take it up. It's going to take months to argue about that and figure that out. So what happened? Why did they change their minds? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party. He has officially weighed in on this as of last night. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=285.24s)]
*  He wants one bill and Republicans need to get it done. We must stand strong together. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=290.72s)]
*  The American people just reelected President Trump again with a resounding mandate to implement these promises that he made to them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  They are needing critical relief in both a form of border security to end the invasion of illegal immigrants that we've seen at our southern border over the past four years. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=302.04s)]
*  They want mass deportations. That's why Congress needs to provide that critical funding for border patrol. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=311.36s)]
*  But simultaneously, tax relief is just as high as a priority. President Trump campaigned on that as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=316.16s)]
*  So one bill, two President Trump's desk. That's what he wants. Republicans need to get it done. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=322.0s)]
*  OK, indeed. Caroline, thank you very much for joining us today from down in Florida, where it's much warmer than it is here in the Northeast. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLIoGBT7VFQ&t=326.44s)]
