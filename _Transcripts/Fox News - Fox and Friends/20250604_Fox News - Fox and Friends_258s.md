# Judge blocks Trump order to end treatment for transgender inmates
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4)
*  So a federal judge blocking an executive order from President Trump that would stop federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=0.0s)]
*  prisons from giving transgender inmates hormone therapy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=4.12s)]
*  The judge said that the administration did not provide a quote serious explanation to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=8.2s)]
*  justify the order. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=12.64s)]
*  Fox News contributor and GWU law professor Jonathan Turley joins us now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Professor, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=18.56s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=21.76s)]
*  So there was a lot of things that I was reading the opinion from the court that I found interesting. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=22.76s)]
*  One was this use of the word personal anguish and that the fact that the state has to offset [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=27.24s)]
*  that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=34.28s)]
*  That was a weird, that's not really a constitutional argument, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, a lot of citizens have difficulty with this and I think many in Congress would like [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  to see this changed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=46.32s)]
*  The problem is it may be difficult for the Trump administration to dislodge this in court [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=48.62s)]
*  because you have medical recommendations to deal with what is called gender dysphoria [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  and these doctors have submitted material that says look this is a legitimate mental [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=59.4s)]
*  illness and if it is then you have to be able to treat it while in prison. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=65.12s)]
*  That may be difficult to dislodge as it goes up on appeal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=72.4s)]
*  It may require Congress to intervene. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=76.32s)]
*  The court get to political though one of the statements from the court was democratic self-governance [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=79.36s)]
*  does not mean blind submission to the whims of the most recent election victor. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah I agree with you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=92.56s)]
*  I felt that the opinion drifted into hyperbole and this is a problem we're seeing with a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=93.56s)]
*  lot of judges where they are essentially virtue signaling through their opinions and I think [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  that's a terrible mistake. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=105.72s)]
*  If you want to say look this is a mental illness and we have got to go with the recommendation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=107.56s)]
*  of the doctors I can understand that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=110.72s)]
*  One can disagree with it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  Maybe Congress wants to do something about it but I don't think that this is a license [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=114.0s)]
*  to have language of that type. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=118.36000000000001s)]
*  Well Professor it goes to the larger conversation which is two thirds of all of the injunctions [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=120.76s)]
*  made ever against the president has been against Donald Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  No it's extraordinary. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=132.44s)]
*  You know Alexander Hamilton referred to the judiciary as the least dangerous branch but [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=135.11999999999998s)]
*  the framers didn't have national injunctions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=140.32s)]
*  They weren't aware that judges could effectively micromanage the executive branch. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=144.04s)]
*  You know we recently had a Boston judge who had just a month earlier been effectively [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  reversed by the Supreme Court. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  His injunction was at least lifted in what was a very controversial order to pay out [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=156.44s)]
*  grants that the administration thought might be fraudulent or wasteful. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=162.16s)]
*  One month later he was back with a new national injunction saying that you couldn't make [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  changes in the Department of Education. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=172.32s)]
*  We have a new San Francisco judge who just said that the president cannot do reductions [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=174.36s)]
*  which is a classic role of classic priority of presidents particularly republicans saying [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=181.2s)]
*  that these are just too great and I'm not going to let you do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=187.56s)]
*  Those raise really troubling issues that is intruding rather deeply into Article 2 presidential [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=192.62s)]
*  powers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  So Jonathan I only got about 30 seconds but hopefully you can give me an answer to this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=200.26s)]
*  If the framers didn't intend for this to happen what is the legal remedy? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=205.32s)]
*  We know Lawrence that's exactly what we are waiting for from the Supreme Court. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=213.88s)]
*  They had an argument at birthright citizenship case to look at national and universal injunctions. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=217.64s)]
*  They also have that case in front of them where the Trump administration is saying we [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=223.04s)]
*  have a right to do reductions in force. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  We have a right to reduce the size of federal of the federal government. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=229.4s)]
*  We're waiting for those decisions and I got to tell you we've been waiting too long for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  the Supreme Court to bring clarity to this area. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Way too long. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=242.0s)]
*  Professor thanks so much for all your knowledge. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you Lawrence. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUXTJd7jd4&t=247.0s)]
