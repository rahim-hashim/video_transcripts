# Musk 'body-checked' Secretary Bessent during White House altercation: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ)
*  All right, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House addressing reports of a physical altercation between Elon Musk and Treasury [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=2.88s)]
*  Secretary Scott Besson earlier this year. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=7.36s)]
*  I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fistfight, Maria. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=10.56s)]
*  It was definitely a disagreement. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=13.18s)]
*  Although I was not there, I didn't witness it with my own eyes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=15.52s)]
*  I heard about it through secondhand reporting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=18.1s)]
*  But again, we've moved on from that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=20.16s)]
*  The president has moved on from it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=22.22s)]
*  And the entire administration is focusing on passing this bill. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=24.12s)]
*  Yep, but in the midst of Musk's public fallout with the president, our next guest says at [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=27.88s)]
*  least we're arguing over how and where to slash spending, pointing out that just three [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=32.16s)]
*  years ago, the only spending talk was about how much would we spend? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=37.28s)]
*  Wall Street Journal editor James Freeman joins us now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=42.16s)]
*  So we know about the physical stuff, and people get into that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=45.2s)]
*  We already knew they were yelling at each other, body check or not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=48.08s)]
*  Your thoughts about the issues that Elon brought up when he exited? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think Elon is angry in part because the cutting of the green subsidies [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=57.88s)]
*  went a little further than he wanted. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=67.2s)]
*  Now, I don't want to knock Elon for that because I think he's really done the taxpayers a great [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=68.84s)]
*  service over the last several months trying to cut federal spending generally. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=73.88s)]
*  I'm also not expecting him to be in a UFC match with Secretary Besson anytime soon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=79.72s)]
*  That's probably good for everybody. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=85.48s)]
*  But yeah, the point I'm making only is, as you point out, the last time Washington did [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=86.92s)]
*  a reconciliation bill, that was three summers ago, that was the so-called Inflation Reduction [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Act. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=98.04s)]
*  And this new big, beautiful bill is moving entirely in another direction. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=99.04s)]
*  It's going to end up with the government spending less over the long term. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=105.12s)]
*  The cuts are not as big as we would like. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=110.44s)]
*  We hope the Senate goes even further because we obviously have a big debt and deficit problem. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  But overall, this is about restraining government, lower taxes, lower spending. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=117.68s)]
*  And I think amid all this kind of personal conflict we've seen the last few days, I think [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=123.36s)]
*  for taxpayers, they should like the big picture in terms of the trajectory here finally turning [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=130.32s)]
*  around on government spending. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=135.96s)]
*  I just think for the administration, get people out there that know the bill, that can explain [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=137.52s)]
*  it in everyday terms. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=141.48s)]
*  And OMB director does a great job, and so does Speaker Johnson. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=144.56s)]
*  I want you to hear what he said about the fracas and about where they go from here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=147.72s)]
*  Look, I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=152.88s)]
*  world. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  What we're trying to do is help hardworking Americans who are trying to provide for their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  families and make ends meet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=162.48s)]
*  Those are the people that are going to be excited about what this legislation produces. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=164.32s)]
*  And that's what they've got to do. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=168.88s)]
*  It's a thousand pages. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=169.92s)]
*  Not many people can read a thousand pages except for the guys at the Wall Street Journal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=171.32s)]
*  like you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=174.2s)]
*  So they got to put it into everyday terms. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=175.6s)]
*  Democrats want a different argument. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=179.72s)]
*  They're not with Elon. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  They want to just spend like crazy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=183.14s)]
*  So they don't even know how to attack except for saying it's a tax break for billionaires. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  So this is a really Republican on a Republican fight. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the details matter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  And again, it would be great to get lower spending out of the Senate. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  But big picture. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=200.32s)]
*  The heart of this is maintaining, simply not having a tax increase, but maintaining those [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=201.84s)]
*  great 2017 reforms that President Trump signed the last time he was in office. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=208.44s)]
*  By the way, a lot of this, I would say the heart of the bill is the president keeping [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=214.32s)]
*  campaign promises. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=218.8s)]
*  Now some of them, I don't think do much for growth. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=220.84s)]
*  And on policy, I'm not a big no tax on tips, guys. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=223.4s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=227.08s)]
*  I always want to take care of my bartender, but I don't understand why he should get a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=228.72s)]
*  different tax regime than other people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=233.84s)]
*  But basically, this is about growth. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=237.96s)]
*  Tax Foundation says the economy long term is 0.8% larger after we do this, about a million [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=241.28s)]
*  more jobs, preventing tax increases, more than a trillion dollars in spending cuts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=247.0s)]
*  And spends less than it would have in the absence of this bill. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=254.4s)]
*  So very positive for growth. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=258.64s)]
*  And it continues the really hopeful trend of the last several months, which is a smaller [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=261.68s)]
*  federal government and a larger private economy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=267.0s)]
*  And we're going to find out about codifying the Doge cuts. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  They begin this week. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  So let's see the 9.8 billion, 9.8 billion. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=274.32s)]
*  Little by little, we'll put them into the budget. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=277.36s)]
*  So then we'll see Doge get some tangible results. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=279.42s)]
*  It's going to be exciting. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=281.44s)]
*  I know you want to talk about too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=282.44s)]
*  You don't like the idea of the salt deduction. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=284.04s)]
*  And neither does a lot of people in Florida and Texas. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=287.32s)]
*  So we'll see where this goes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  Thanks so much, James Freeman. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  Read his editorial in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq72Xjm4rYQ&t=297.42s)]
