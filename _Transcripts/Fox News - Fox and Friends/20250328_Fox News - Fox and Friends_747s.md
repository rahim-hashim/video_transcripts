# 'INFURIATING!': Hosts react to Elon Musk's 'mind-blowing' DOGE revelations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE)
*  All right, here we go. Elon Musk sat down for an exclusive interview alongside seven [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=0.0s)]
*  members of the Doze team giving a behind-the-scenes look, a lift of the curtain up of President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=5.2s)]
*  Trump's cost-cutting department. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=10.72s)]
*  The team consists of a wide range of experts, including a former rocket scientist and one [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=13.0s)]
*  of the co-founders of the rental site Airbnb. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=17.94s)]
*  The Doze team also consists of engineers and all have the same goal, to slash wasteful [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  government spending. Watch. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=26.82s)]
*  Our goal is to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=29.12s)]
*  You technically are a special government employee and you're supposed to be 130 days. Are you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=32.58s)]
*  going to continue past that or do you think that's what you're going to do? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=38.68s)]
*  I think we will have accomplished most of the work required to reduce the deficit by [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=44.32s)]
*  a trillion dollars within that time frame. We actually want to be careful in the cuts, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=48.32s)]
*  So we want to measure twice, if not thrice, and cut once. And actually that is our approach. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=52.08s)]
*  They may characterize it as shooting from the hip, but it is anything but that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=61.46s)]
*  Some people say this shouldn't take a rocket scientist. Steve Davis, you are a rocket scientist. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=66.52s)]
*  Used to be. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=72.8s)]
*  That all of us are willing to kind of put our lives on hold in order to do. I think [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=74.42s)]
*  the thing that's special right now is we actually believe there's a chance to succeed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=77.68s)]
*  We really believe that the government can have an Apple Store-like experience. Beautifully [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=81.78s)]
*  designed, great user experience, modern systems. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=86.7s)]
*  This is beautiful. You know, Rachel, you have multiple kids, so you know the boogie man [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=90.26s)]
*  theory. They think something is under their bed and they think it's very, and then you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=94.02s)]
*  pull it out of their bed and it's just a little toy. And that's what happened yesterday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=97.94s)]
*  We haven't seen their faces. And so the media and the Democrats have been saying, oh, this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  is the boogie man. They're trying to take things away from you. These are accomplished [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=107.38s)]
*  individuals that love the country and want to make life better for the American people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=111.54s)]
*  They're trying to create a user-friendly government essentially. And I love my favorite quote [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=116.7s)]
*  was creating the Apple experience for these government workers. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  Imagine they were talking about creating that Apple experience in the context of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=128.46s)]
*  fact that they came in and said we want to fix Social Security. And they're like, yeah, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=132.46s)]
*  well, we can only do 8,000 cases a month. And then they said, well, that's because there's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=136.66s)]
*  a mine. And they're like, what do you mean there's a mine or a day, I think. What do [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  you mean there's a mine? They thought it was like a symbol for something else. No, it's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=146.3s)]
*  a literal mine. There's so much paperwork. Our government bought a mine and they are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=152.1s)]
*  doing everything by hand. And to your point, far from taking anything away, these guys [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=157.22s)]
*  are giving our money back. I mean, Brian, we're really close to tax day, to when everyone [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=162.9s)]
*  pays their taxes. They take almost half of my money. When I saw what was going on, the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=169.74s)]
*  amount of waste, the things that they said, they're finding a billion dollars here, a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=174.38s)]
*  billion dollars there. We heard about the $2 billion going to Stacey Abrams. This is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=177.58s)]
*  so infuriating. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=183.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think when people say, they do using buzz terms, like he's going to cut your Social [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=184.9s)]
*  Security. No, he's reforming Social Security, get the fraud out. Now, I want to see what [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=189.94s)]
*  is actually in our three cuts. And then I'll respond to it after. The thing that struck [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=193.34s)]
*  me is he's a dead serious people, no interest in politics, their version of service, that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=197.62s)]
*  rental guy, that Airbnb guy, a multi-billionaire. He runs into Elon Musk at a party and he says, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=202.5s)]
*  can you help us out? He goes, how? And he said, can you start reforming some of our [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  systems? Let me go take a look. And they see so many things that are ripe for reform and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=213.62s)]
*  the term that keeps on jumping out is care. It's almost impossible to care about taxpayer [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=218.9s)]
*  money like you do your own. It's not real. We don't know what was coming in and we don't [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=224.94000000000003s)]
*  know where it's going. And it doesn't matter because it's not theirs. Listen more of what [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  the Doge team had to say about their approach. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=235.3s)]
*  The sheer amount of waste and fraud in the government, it is astonishing. It's mind-blowing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=239.58s)]
*  We routinely encounter wastes of a billion dollars or more, casually. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=245.78s)]
*  The first thing that got me really excited about Doge was learning basically the state [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=250.9s)]
*  of government computers. By some estimates, government IT costs about $100 billion and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=255.4s)]
*  it's funding systems that are over 50 years old. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=262.7s)]
*  The amount of issues that were with the social security system are enormous. As an example, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=266.3s)]
*  there are over 15 million people that are over the age of 120 that are marked as alive [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=271.4s)]
*  in the social security system. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=278.2s)]
*  Under the Biden administration, there was no departmental oversight within the Department [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=279.44s)]
*  of Interior whatsoever. None. We are now reviewing every single contract, every single grant. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=283.84s)]
*  There are in the federal government around 4.6 million credit cards for around 2.3 to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  2.4 million employees. This doesn't make sense. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=296.96s)]
*  And so one of the things all the teams have worked on is we've worked with the agencies [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  and said, do you need all of these credit cards? Are they being used? Can you tell us [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=306.04s)]
*  physically where they are? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=311.04s)]
*  So the math is just not adding up. And you've got these people that are respected business [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=313.44s)]
*  people in their own right. They don't need this. I mean, they're not getting paid that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=320.04s)]
*  much. They're spending time away from their family and their own business and it's causing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=324.2s)]
*  all these attacks on Tesla and the car itself didn't do anything. The people that are driving [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  the cars didn't do anything. Here's Elon Musk on that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think a great wrong is being done to the people of Tesla and to our customers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=339.8s)]
*  Tesla is a peaceful company that has made great cars, great products. That's what it's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=346.8s)]
*  done. It hasn't harmed anyone. And yet people are committing violence. They're firebombing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=352.44000000000005s)]
*  Tesla dealerships. They're shooting guns into stores. They're threatening people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=358.92s)]
*  They're issuing death threats against me and other Tesla personnel. What are they doing [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=365.92s)]
*  this for? Why? What's happening, it seems to me, is they're being fed propaganda by [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=371.8s)]
*  the far left and they believe it. It's really unfortunate. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=377.88s)]
*  And they're getting paid to do it and they're making some arrests. But going back a little [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=384.92s)]
*  to what the Doge team did. So what they're trying to say is the buzz term that Democrats [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=387.64s)]
*  have been saying is it cutting Social Security or they're cutting Medicare? No. One thing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=391.28s)]
*  that really struck me when he says 40% of the calls into Social Security are people [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  trying to change their account to direct deposit. I thought his next comment would be, because [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=402.4s)]
*  it's so complicated, you should be able to do this online. He said no, it's fraudsters [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=406.28s)]
*  trying to get Mr. and Mrs. Jones' account, pretending to be Mr. and Mrs. Jones, calling [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=410.8s)]
*  up saying can you deposit it here? So you've got other people just flat out fraud and it's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=415.02s)]
*  probably other countries. So what they're trying to do is keep more money in Social [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  Security. It's going to go bankrupt in 10 years. Everybody knows it. And also the computer [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=425.62s)]
*  system that we're running on. The computers can't talk to each other. So for example, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=430.14s)]
*  it allows a nine month old to be able to get a small business loan because they just used [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=434.78s)]
*  the ID, because they're fraudsters, to order an apply for a business loan. But if they [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=439.47999999999996s)]
*  were hooked up to Social Security, they would have been registered on Social Security and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=443.5s)]
*  it would have stopped it. A nine month old doesn't need a small business loan. So these [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=447.66s)]
*  guys come in, probably for no money, and they sit there trying to tie the computers in like [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=450.74s)]
*  it's 2025, not like it's 1982. And they're getting nothing but blow back as if now, instead [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=455.78s)]
*  of being prideful of what they're doing, not seeing their family and their four kids, instead [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=462.34s)]
*  they've got to not tell everyone or their family what they're doing because it's been [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=466.3s)]
*  misrepresented. And I do believe in the administration just a little bit because these guys didn't [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=470.02s)]
*  want any fame and fortune and any attention. Therefore, it sounds like everything was a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=474.97999999999996s)]
*  secret. That's what Lawrence was referring to. So you saw a combination of both fraud, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  massive billions and billions of dollars of fraud, and then incompetence, using systems [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=484.85999999999996s)]
*  like pushing paperwork like we did in the 1950s with file cabinets and manila folders. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=490.41999999999996s)]
*  You saw both that. But again, Elon Musk talking about the cars. I mean, there is no room for [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=495.78s)]
*  political violence. He says, we're a peaceful company. I'll say this. What they're mad about, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=502.78s)]
*  for the most part, is the fraud he's uncovering. That's right. They're mad because there was [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=508.17999999999995s)]
*  a money laundering scheme where, for example, I'm going to bring up the Stacey Abrams thing [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=511.9s)]
*  because I think it's really instructive. Two billion dollars. She had a hundred dollars [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=516.5s)]
*  in the account of this thing and suddenly gets an injection of two billion dollars. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=519.86s)]
*  For what? What is she doing? How did she get that? This has been going on for a long time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=525.3s)]
*  They're laundering money. If you want to protest Tesla, there are some reasons to protest Tesla [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=530.62s)]
*  that are noble. For example, I believe these electric cars make us more dependent on China [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=535.74s)]
*  for all of these minerals. You could talk about the cobalt mines in Africa that are [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=540.82s)]
*  needed to make these batteries where 40,000 little kids are working in these mines. Those [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  are noble reasons to oppose Tesla or the electrification of all of these vehicles and this movement. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=554.26s)]
*  But uncovering fraud? No. Go to the Prius dealership. How about that? That might be [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=561.66s)]
*  a good way to start. DC Elected Car in general. This is a totally American company. And we're [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=567.14s)]
*  finding out, too, with the arrests that they're having, like this guy, Paul Kim, he got hit [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=571.8199999999999s)]
*  with arson, destruction of property, possession of explosive device. They're going back to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=575.54s)]
*  communists and power Palestinian movement, all working together. And when you go to your [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=579.86s)]
*  thing, Elon Musk keeps pointing us to the NGOs. They keep pointing us and saying they've [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=585.9s)]
*  been making so much money, these NGOs, and they are taking them down. They're making [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=591.74s)]
*  them validate their existence. They can't do it. So it's all coming down. And when you [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=596.2199999999999s)]
*  take something away from people that are cheating the system, they have nothing to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=600.94s)]
*  lose. And that's what we're witnessing. And I've got to give Musk so much credit. He just [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=605.34s)]
*  stares straight ahead and he keeps going. He does a great job of masking his emotions. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=609.2600000000001s)]
*  He only owns 15% of Tesla people. You're not hurting him. You're hurting the different [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=612.98s)]
*  pension funds and different funds around the country that looked at Tesla as a solid investment. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=618.08s)]
*  And now all of a sudden it looks like it would not be a solid investment because of the massive [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=623.46s)]
*  attacks. Now, some 18 year old who's got an electric car in a senior year in high school, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  the parents don't want to let her take it to school because it could be targeted on [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=633.6999999999999s)]
*  the streets by some lunatic. It's also so stupid because Tesla's not taking a position. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=637.3s)]
*  Elon is taking a position. Right. They keep comparing us to Bud Light and saying, oh, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=641.74s)]
*  this is what you guys did. First of all, we didn't set Bud Light on fire. Number two, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=645.26s)]
*  it was the company of Bud Light that took the position. It wasn't the owner of it doing [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=650.18s)]
*  stuff for the government. I love that Brian brought up the NGOs again. When we were all [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=655.66s)]
*  looking at the border, what did we find at the bottom of this? NGOs making money. That's [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=660.2199999999999s)]
*  right. NGOs making the Catholic Church, Lutheran. Catholic Charities. Catholic Charities, Lutheran [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=665.2199999999999s)]
*  Charities, Jewish Charities, all of them on the team. And they don't want to let you in. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=669.38s)]
*  There's no transparency. What this is about is, as you said in the intro, pulling the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  curtain back, letting people look in and deciding come April when you pay your taxes, do you [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=678.06s)]
*  want to go into that? I don't think so. I just wonder if there's any reasonable Democrats [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=683.98s)]
*  that could be brought into this process like we just saw with Brett, no cameras, and say, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=687.94s)]
*  guys, what you're protesting, what you're saying about cutting Social Security and cutting [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=692.66s)]
*  it's just not true. Look at what we found. So I think that if there's reasonably people [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=696.9s)]
*  out there, and it's not Chuck Schumer because he's fighting for his life, like Ro Kahana [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=702.7s)]
*  was supposed to be on with us today, but he had a transportation issue. He has 20, 20,000 [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=706.82s)]
*  people in his district work for Tesla. And also he knows Elon Musk for 30 years. So I'm [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=711.42s)]
*  curious to see if there's somebody reasonable on the left that they could start understanding [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=716.5s)]
*  what their protesting and what their backing is fraud, what their protesting is finding [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=720.9s)]
*  out about that fraud. I dare you to watch last night and see politics. And I'm sure [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=725.3199999999999s)]
*  we're going to put it, I'm sure it's on FoxNews.com. You click on special report, the poll show [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=730.3s)]
*  will drop down, you can watch it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpVn_3lzJE&t=734.4599999999999s)]
