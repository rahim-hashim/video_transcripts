# Trump urges AG Letitia James to resign amid bombshell fraud allegations: 'Wacky crook'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw)
*  Speaking of law, the Trump administration referring New York Attorney General Letitia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=0.0s)]
*  James for possible prosecution over suspected, get this, fraud over a mortgage on a house [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=4.88s)]
*  in Virginia. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=12.94s)]
*  Todd Pyro joins us now with the details. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=14.32s)]
*  Todd? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=17.12s)]
*  Good morning to all four of you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=18.12s)]
*  Remember that song from the 90s, things that make you go, hmm, this is that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=19.12s)]
*  The Ingram angle obtaining documents from the Federal Housing Finance Agency accusing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=23.28s)]
*  James of, quote, falsifying records in order to meet certain lending requirements and receive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=28.08s)]
*  favorable loan terms. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=34.44s)]
*  Now here is what she's accused of doing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  One, listing a home in Virginia as her primary residence in 2023 while serving as New York's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=38.92s)]
*  top prosecutor. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=45.16s)]
*  Two, James reportedly also listed her father as her husband on mortgage applications. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  The Federal Housing Finance Agency says she bought a five-family home in Brooklyn but [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=53.52s)]
*  misrepresented the same property as only having four units in building permit applications [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=58.52s)]
*  and numerous documents. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=63.6s)]
*  Now this, of course, is a role reversal of sorts for James. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=65.04s)]
*  In 2022, she won a $454 million civil fraud judgment against President Trump and the Trump [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=68.6s)]
*  organization stating he falsified business records and misrepresented his net worth. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=74.72s)]
*  That case currently on appeal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=80.6s)]
*  James frequently sat in the courtroom throughout those proceedings. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=82.8s)]
*  No love lost between the two, as you can see in some of these pictures. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=86.16s)]
*  President Trump reacting to the new accusations against her, writing on Truth Social. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=89.92s)]
*  Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New York [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=94.36s)]
*  State Attorney General immediately. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=99.52s)]
*  Everyone is trying to make New York great again and it can never be done with this wacky [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  crook in office. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=106.36s)]
*  Fox News contributor and law professor Jonathan Turley also weighing in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=108.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=111.88s)]
*  The irony is perfectly crushing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  This is a person who prosecuted Trump for everything short of ripping a label off a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=115.72s)]
*  mattress. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  As for James, if we apply the Letitia James standard that she created, there'd be little [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  question here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=131.24s)]
*  This seems pretty straightforward. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=132.44s)]
*  Letitia James has not responded to our request for comment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  Guys, back over to you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=139.84s)]
*  It is such a crazy story. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=140.76s)]
*  But Todd, I mean, there she is on an application. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=141.96s)]
*  She says that her occupation is attorney general for the state of New York. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=144.96s)]
*  But at the same time, she says, my primary residence is in Virginia. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=149.76s)]
*  Huh? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=153.64s)]
*  And I want to be clear, I think I may have said 2002. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=154.64s)]
*  I believe it was 2003 that the case against Trump started. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=157.52s)]
*  That is when she applied for this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=161.48s)]
*  So the fact that she accused and won in court against President Trump on charges [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=163.36s)]
*  involving documents, the fact that she then apparently reportedly misrepresented herself [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=169.12s)]
*  on documents, speaks volumes and will be interesting to see how this all plays out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=176.28s)]
*  Todd, what would be the point of listing that as your primary residence so you can pay taxes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=180.56s)]
*  in Virginia and not New York? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=185.0s)]
*  That appears to be unclear. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=186.72s)]
*  I mean, look, inevitably she is paid by the state of New York. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=187.96s)]
*  Yeah. So her income taxes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=190.96s)]
*  But, you know, I'm no tax law expert. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Presumably, when you do something like that, there is a tax reason. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=195.48s)]
*  It could be connected to some familial relation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=199.76s)]
*  A couple gains. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=202.92s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you don't tweak documents like that, probably, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=203.44s)]
*  unless there's some financial gain to you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=209.12s)]
*  And that is ultimately what she accused Donald Trump of doing in 2000. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=212.12s)]
*  Why would you list your dad as your husband? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=216.28s)]
*  Maybe your dad's helping her financially. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=218.04s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what it is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=220.04s)]
*  You can't do that. You can't. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=221.2s)]
*  You can't list your dad as your husband. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=222.72s)]
*  It's so easy to find out, though. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=224.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=225.52s)]
*  What kind of bank? It's not asking. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  He looks a little older than you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=227.8s)]
*  You should have... [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=229.0s)]
*  Maybe somebody else filled it out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Which would be fraud, probably. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5ECSzRAYDw&t=232.52s)]
