# Student who escaped Iran disturbed by liberal classmates
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE)
*  George Washington University Law student and Dissident Project speaker joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=0.0s)]
*  Tamina is here with us. Tamina, thanks so much for joining the program. So you know this all too well. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=4.96s)]
*  I guess what is your message to the college students out there today that are simply buying [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=10.88s)]
*  the propaganda? You know, being a college student at George Washington University is a great [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=16.56s)]
*  privilege. It bears the name of our first president, George Washington. No Jewish student [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=23.76s)]
*  should feel unsafe at a campus that bears the name of George Washington. As someone who has escaped [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=29.44s)]
*  a government that supports acts of violence that you're now seeing right now being poured in Israel [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  by Hamas, I think it's really disturbing that students at American college campuses are not [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=44.64s)]
*  only supporting but also are engaging these anti-Semitic rhetoric. They're violent against [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=51.2s)]
*  their classmates. They justify killing of their families in Israel. I think that is really [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=57.2s)]
*  unacceptable. However, it's not surprising because in the past decade, academia has been a place [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=63.2s)]
*  where these ideas have been supported and endorsed. Yeah, and we're showing footage from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  George Washington where it's saying, glory to our martyrs. I mean it's using the talking points of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=77.52s)]
*  Hamas, but I want you to dig deeper into what these professors are doing because there's a lot [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  of parents that are watching this. They're saying, I don't know what happened to my child. I sent them [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  away loving all people and now they hate the Jews. We've seen that professors on campuses like Yale [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=94.08s)]
*  and Harvard, they've been not only complicit but have also endorsed very similar messages. Students [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=103.28s)]
*  right now, they don't really know who are the real players in this war. It's not Israel versus [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=109.68s)]
*  Palestine. This is really about good versus evil. Hamas is a terrorist organization that has killed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=115.12s)]
*  millions of civilians and is backed by government like Islamic Republic of Iran. They have no [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=122.16s)]
*  sympathy for the liberal values that we uphold very dearly in this country. We see that in academia. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=128.24s)]
*  These students are taught to hate these western values that we hold really dear. To me, that's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  not surprising because when you see that rhetoric is taught and endorsed by professors in academia, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  obviously students are going to be sympathetic to extremist groups like Hamas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=147.6s)]
*  Someone that knows all about this that is opposing it, but you should read her full op-ed about this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=152.88s)]
*  It's really interesting stuff. Go to FoxNews.com to see that. Tamina, thanks so much for getting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=157.92s)]
*  up early this morning to be with us. Thank you so much for having me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GSQzkzogE&t=162.64s)]
