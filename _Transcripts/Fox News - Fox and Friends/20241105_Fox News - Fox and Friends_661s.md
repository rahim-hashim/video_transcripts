# Cuban Missile Crisis veteran sounds alarm about Kamala Harris: 'So afraid'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4)
*  Hey guys, I'm here with some businessmen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=0.0s)]
*  This gentleman, what's your name? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=2.92s)]
*  George McCool. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=4.64s)]
*  George sells medical devices. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=5.64s)]
*  What has the economic environment been for you? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=7.2s)]
*  Can you compare Kamala Harris's and Joe Biden's economy to the Trump economy for your specific [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=9.32s)]
*  business? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=14.52s)]
*  I think the price of everything has gone up dramatically over the last four years and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=15.52s)]
*  you can equate that to the price of fuel, the price of goods. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=18.44s)]
*  And I think if we get the price of fuel and oil down, that's really going to start to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=21.6s)]
*  help with the transportation of things and start to bring prices back down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=24.8s)]
*  That's your top issue. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=28.04s)]
*  The economy is a tough one. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=29.36s)]
*  Another businessman here, he has a print shop. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=30.36s)]
*  Tell me how the economy has been affecting you and your business. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=32.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think just the cost of goods has really gone through the roof. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=35.6s)]
*  So to cost the printer shirts, to cost the buyer shirts, it really gets to the point [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=39.92s)]
*  how much can you charge for a t-shirt to your customers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  So the cost of goods has really been going up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=47.16s)]
*  You're voting for Trump? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=48.56s)]
*  I am voting for Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=49.56s)]
*  You think it's going to turn around quickly? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=50.56s)]
*  Well, he was in office before, I think, you know, his economy was pretty good when he [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  was in. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=55.72s)]
*  So I think he'll do it again, yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=56.72s)]
*  All right, let's talk to these guys here because they say their top issue is the border. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=58.04s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=62.12s)]
*  We have young children and every day you turn on the news and you see scary things happening [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=63.56s)]
*  and it's happening everywhere in the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=67.72s)]
*  So you don't ever want that to hit too close to home. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=70.08s)]
*  Your paternal instinct kicking in. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=72.64s)]
*  Protection, we talked about that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=74.12s)]
*  All right, what's your name? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=77.24s)]
*  Jackie. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=78.48s)]
*  Your issue, also the border. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=79.48s)]
*  Yes, I'm a teacher, so I'm very protective of my own children and all my students. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=81.12s)]
*  I want them to be safe, grow up in the environment like we all did, that sense of community and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  not have to fear that stuff coming in. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=92.0s)]
*  And this is? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=95.56s)]
*  Terry Murth. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=96.56s)]
*  What is it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=97.56s)]
*  Terry Murth. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=98.56s)]
*  Terry, you're a grandma. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=99.56s)]
*  Tell me about your thoughts on the election from the perspective of a grandmother. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=101.4s)]
*  Well, I want my grandchildren to grow up the way my children did and the way I did in a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  free country, to be able to do the things that you want to do and not to have to worry [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=109.44s)]
*  about all the wokeness that now has become the norm. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=113.68s)]
*  We also need to take care of our veterans. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=118.24s)]
*  We need to take care of our senior citizens. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=121.56s)]
*  And I don't want to see that money going toward illegal immigrants. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=123.56s)]
*  We need to close that border and we need to close it right away. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=126.4s)]
*  All right, you're hearing that from Pennsylvania, the state that might decide this election. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=129.0s)]
*  A little later, we're going to have Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House with us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=133.68s)]
*  And I think he's going to flip some pancakes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  So stay with us. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=139.48s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=140.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=141.48s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=142.48s)]
*  They're doing a lot of walking. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=144.32s)]
*  Is that an homage to me? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=145.32s)]
*  They're trying to get in their steps. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  You taught us all how to do it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  And Will Kane is somebody who walks backwards. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=149.76s)]
*  This is something pretty interesting. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=151.76s)]
*  He's live at the sweet spot in Concord, North Carolina. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=152.76s)]
*  The polls are now open. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=155.16s)]
*  Hey, Will. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=156.16s)]
*  Hey, sweet. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=157.16s)]
*  I didn't realize, I didn't realize Brian had patented walking. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=161.16s)]
*  So I'm going to stand still here to make sure I don't have any copyright infringements. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=165.16s)]
*  You know, I was thinking last night, guys, Brian Ainsley, Steve Lawrence, I was thinking [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  about this election. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=172.28s)]
*  And one of the issues that we don't, I think, talk enough about is we're hiring the next [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=173.28s)]
*  commander in chief. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=177.28s)]
*  And often, presidencies are defined by something they don't see coming. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  That's often safety, security on the world stage. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=182.64s)]
*  I've got veterans all around me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=185.16s)]
*  I've got Jim, a Korean War veteran, Mike, a Vietnam veteran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=187.24s)]
*  Thank you guys for your service. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=192.88s)]
*  Mike, tell me what's important to you in this election. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=194.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'd like to see us get a commander in chief that will get our military [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=197.2s)]
*  back to the level it should be. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=201.52s)]
*  Also, I'd like to have a commander in chief that our allies respect and a commander in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=203.52s)]
*  chief that our enemies respect and fear. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=208.36s)]
*  That's what we need in this country. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=211.52s)]
*  I appreciate your service. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=212.8s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mike. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=213.88s)]
*  Thank you, Jim. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=214.88s)]
*  We also have Glenn, by the way. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=215.88s)]
*  Glenn's a Vietnam War vet. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=218.08s)]
*  Thank you, Glenn. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=219.44s)]
*  What do you feel about this election and when it comes to hiring a commander in chief? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=220.44s)]
*  The past ones that Donald Trump had were... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  He just didn't realize what Washington was like. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  And the generals in the Pentagon, they're only there to get promoted. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  So they're more political than they are warriors. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=241.32s)]
*  And he needs to find the proper one to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=245.64s)]
*  You feel like he's the right one to be commander in chief? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=253.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=255.4s)]
*  You know, we're doing a little horse race politics here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  I was asking everybody how they feel about North Carolina. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=258.76s)]
*  One of the big concerns is, well, the Republican Governor Mark Robbins not looking good. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=261.48s)]
*  How could that affect Donald Trump? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=266.16s)]
*  But Donnie said that you're not worried about the effect of the governor's race on the presidential [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=267.24s)]
*  race. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=272.0s)]
*  I'm not, especially here in North Carolina. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=273.0s)]
*  Normally, you know, Trump won in 2016 and 2020. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=275.48s)]
*  But we got a Democratic governor. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=280.0s)]
*  So I think the party gets split on a ticket. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=282.48s)]
*  Happens a lot. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=286.92s)]
*  It does. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=287.92s)]
*  And here especially. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=288.92s)]
*  I think Trump has a lot of support here and it won't necessarily affect the rest of the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=289.92s)]
*  ticket won't affect him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=295.84s)]
*  I mean, it's a split state. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=296.84s)]
*  Happens a lot here in North Carolina. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=298.38s)]
*  Finally, you know, I heard Rachel talking in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=299.96s)]
*  It is the number one issue, no matter which state you go into, and that's the economy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=303.34s)]
*  Lori was telling me about the biggest issues for you voting. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=307.56s)]
*  One of my issues is I used to pay for my insurance, you know, in segments, and now [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=310.84s)]
*  I have to pay by monthly. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  And when I moved here eight years ago, I was paying 79.99 cents for eggs. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=317.23999999999995s)]
*  And now they're up to three dollars a dozen. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  And your mom lives with you, Joan. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=324.96s)]
*  Good morning, Joan. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  My thing is the economy, too. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=329.23999999999995s)]
*  And I'm a senior and I have Social Security. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=332.84s)]
*  However, I am blessed because I have other resources and I live with my daughter. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  My insurance in the car has gone up almost double in the last three years. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know how seniors can keep up with this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=346.32s)]
*  We were talking about this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=348.92s)]
*  How do you manage fixed income with this kind of inflation? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=350.0s)]
*  It's almost impossible. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=353.12s)]
*  But that's where we are right now in North Carolina. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=354.12s)]
*  Polls are open in North Carolina. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=356.2s)]
*  People out there have left. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=357.56s)]
*  Some have left to go to the polls. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=358.56s)]
*  Now we're going to leave North Carolina and go back to you in New York. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=365.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=366.12s)]
*  If you look at North Carolina, you know, the polls are going to close tonight. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=367.12s)]
*  One place where the polls opened and closed within a matter of minutes is Dixville Notch [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=370.76s)]
*  in the great state of New Hampshire. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=375.44s)]
*  In 2020, Joe Biden swept. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=379.24s)]
*  But last night at the stroke of midnight, all six residents came in. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=382.96s)]
*  It was a tie. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=387.8s)]
*  Three for Donald Trump and three for Joe Biden. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=389.0s)]
*  Split right down the middle, just like the whole country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=391.48s)]
*  Last year it was eight. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, actually, 2016, it was eight. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=397.56s)]
*  Yeah, you had two that voted for Hillary, four for Trump, one for Gary Johnson, one [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=400.0s)]
*  for Mitt Romney. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=403.76s)]
*  Then in 2020, Biden got the six votes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=404.76s)]
*  Now there's six. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=407.28s)]
*  So I don't know if two people passed away or two people died. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=408.28s)]
*  I mean, two people moved. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=411.32s)]
*  I find fascinating New Hampshire, Virginia, maybe Kansas, Minnesota, all those that don't [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  get heavily polled. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  And you wonder, I remember Governor Sununu about a month ago came in and said, I don't [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=419.96s)]
*  know why there's not more Trump infrastructure in New Hampshire because it's wide open, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=423.08s)]
*  because they're angry at the Democrats for pulling that first primary out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=428.68s)]
*  And I think that matters a lot. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=432.56s)]
*  So I'm very curious to see those late pushes into New Hampshire by J.D. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=434.2s)]
*  Vance. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=438.52s)]
*  I think the president went there once, if it's going to produce anything. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=439.52s)]
*  Well, speaking of late pushes in Wisconsin, let's go to Pete Exath. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=441.68s)]
*  He's live at the Coop in Waukesha. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=445.4s)]
*  Pete, the polls are going to close there at nine o'clock Eastern time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=447.2s)]
*  But they won't probably finish counting until tomorrow. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=452.04s)]
*  So people are going to be on pins and needles in Wisconsin. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=456.48s)]
*  I know, especially in the city of Milwaukee, where it's traditionally taken a lot more [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=459.04s)]
*  time. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=465.6s)]
*  And that's a that's a part of the concern for voters here. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=466.6s)]
*  Will the vote out state outside of Milwaukee be large enough to overcome what happens in [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=469.44s)]
*  that city? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=474.12s)]
*  And then how long is the delay in that city as well? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=475.16s)]
*  So voters here enthusiastic this morning, for sure. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=477.62s)]
*  Because, as we said before, it's true, the polls don't matter anymore. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=481.84s)]
*  The pundits don't matter anymore. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  It is we the people on Election Day and in Wisconsin, they're voting for a lot of people. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=489.64s)]
*  I mean, a lot of eyes on your state tonight. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=494.64s)]
*  So Steve, what are your first of all, what issue motivated you to go to the polls? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=498.08s)]
*  Or you're actually you're going to the polls in an hour. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=501.23999999999995s)]
*  Yes, I'll be there first thing right after breakfast and securing the border, foreign [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=503.28s)]
*  policy, election integrity. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=507.84s)]
*  It's all really, really important. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=510.64s)]
*  And I'm voting for Trump and Hovde. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=513.02s)]
*  And we're going to have Eric Hovde on the program in a little bit. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  How you feeling about give our viewers how you feeling about Wisconsin this cycle? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=519.48s)]
*  Well, I really think that Trump and Hovde, I think the Republicans are going to win. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=523.08s)]
*  It's going to be close. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  But there's just too much silliness going on out there with this current administration. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=528.36s)]
*  And so I think the Republicans are going to take it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=532.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=535.24s)]
*  Jenny, you and your husband voted early. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=536.24s)]
*  You helped your sons submit absentee ballots. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=540.84s)]
*  They're in college. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=543.08s)]
*  So you got you banked four votes already. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=544.08s)]
*  How you feeling about the election here in Wisconsin? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=546.52s)]
*  Good. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=548.44s)]
*  There's been a lot of interest in us, of course, because we're a swing state. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=549.44s)]
*  And I've seen a lot of a lot more ground activity than we have in the past and a lot more signs [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=552.8s)]
*  and enthusiastic rallies. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=556.6s)]
*  A lot of they've had a lot of visits to Wisconsin. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=558.08s)]
*  That's been great to see that too. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=560.4s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=561.4s)]
*  And as far as issues that you and your husband are voting on, on behalf of all strong, intelligent [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=562.4s)]
*  women, what matters the most to you? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=565.84s)]
*  For us, it's the economy. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=569.08s)]
*  We have three boys, one just finished college and he's has a great job, but living at home [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=571.08s)]
*  trying to get a house someday. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=575.52s)]
*  And we have two more boys finishing college this year. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=577.08s)]
*  So we hope they have good careers and can get a job and afford things. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=579.36s)]
*  So that's really is the basics, isn't it? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=582.32s)]
*  Basics. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=584.76s)]
*  That's just afford things at the grocery store like we used to. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=585.76s)]
*  So yeah, there are more ground activity in Wisconsin than we've seen before. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=587.96s)]
*  And Will, you've talked to some great vets and thank you for their service. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=592.02s)]
*  We've got one here too. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=595.0s)]
*  Sir, what's your name? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=596.0s)]

*  Hi. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=599.0s)]
*  Jack, what did you do in the military? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=600.0s)]
*  I served during the Cuban Missile Crisis and I used to shoot missiles and knock planes [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=601.0s)]
*  out of the sky and I don't want to see them landing here. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=606.24s)]
*  That's my main motivation. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=610.12s)]
*  And I am so afraid that these people do not stand up to other foreign leaders like Trump [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=615.4799999999999s)]
*  does and tells them where to go. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=621.8s)]
*  And that's what we need. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  We need people who are respected by our enemies and will calm down. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  And Trump's good at that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=634.02s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your service. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGlGyJTxzj4&t=635.3199999999999s)]
