# 'Did you see Kamala?!': Hosts react to Trump and Obama's friendly chat
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A)
*  Now to a viral moment that unfolded during former President Jimmy Carter's official state funeral, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump and former President Obama sharing a laugh. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=5.0s)]
*  And here's what Trump has to say about it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=8.6s)]
*  It did look very friendly, I must say. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=12.0s)]
*  I didn't realize it. I didn't realize how friendly it looked. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=14.0s)]
*  I saw it on your wonderful network just a little while ago before I came in and I said, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=20.0s)]
*  they look like two people that like each other and we probably do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=26.0s)]
*  Wow, Trump says despite their political differences, he and his predecessor still managed to get along, at least in that moment they did. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=30.0s)]
*  I was reading his lips, he goes, aren't you the one who called me a Nazi? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=37.0s)]
*  I mean, they got along fantastic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=42.0s)]
*  The New York Post actually did hire a lip reader and they were talking a little bit about some programs that went away and stuff like that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=44.0s)]
*  It was kind of technical. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=52.0s)]
*  My big question though is, is there an ex-president, a former president text thread? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=54.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=60.0s)]
*  Because if I were, and in those five, I would make sure I'm on it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=61.0s)]
*  By the way, we have not talked about that situation. We were all watching those scenes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=65.0s)]
*  Mike Pence was there. He shook hands with the president. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=69.0s)]
*  Karen Pence didn't want to shake Melania or the president's hand. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=73.0s)]
*  And then did you see Kamala Harris? She was just like this when Biden and Jill came up. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=77.0s)]
*  Did not even look at them, did not say hello. At least in that shot she did when they sat down beside her. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=82.0s)]
*  What's up with that? I thought they had each other's backs. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=88.0s)]
*  It was a funeral, right? Very quiet. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=91.0s)]
*  At a funeral, even at a funeral, I would say something like, you know, nice to see you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=94.0s)]
*  Because he died at 100. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=99.0s)]
*  Watch when he sits down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=101.0s)]
*  I hope this is an example for the country though. The family members are not speaking to each other over the election. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=103.0s)]
*  That is really not that serious. You got them laughing it up right there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=107.0s)]
*  We want to see that. We want more of this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=111.0s)]
*  The thing is, if Michelle doesn't show up, they don't sit next to each other. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=114.0s)]
*  But Michelle's a no-show. They move the seats together because they're fold up chairs. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=118.0s)]
*  And you got rid of them and they just close it up. What have you been doing? What have you been doing? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=122.0s)]
*  Folding chairs at the National Cathedral? You make it sound like it's a moose lodge. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=127.0s)]
*  Why didn't Michelle show up? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=131.0s)]
*  She had to be. She was stuck in Hawaii. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. She was on vacation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=136.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=138.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA0MKH94T_A&t=139.0s)]
