# This is a 'race we can't lose' to China, Doug Burgum warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU)
*  Interior Secretary Doug Burgum getting a first-hand look at two coal mines in Alabama, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=0.0s)]
*  visiting workers there as part of Trump's energy agenda. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=5.68s)]
*  This comes after the president signed an executive order this week to revive America's coal industry. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. He joins us now with more. Doug, how you going? How you doing? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=15.52s)]
*  You ready for the Masters? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=23.04s)]
*  Well, yes. Good morning, Clay. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Rachel. Great to be with you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=24.48s)]
*  All right, so let's talk about these coal mines because we know that China builds about two plants per week. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Tell me how Donald Trump is planning and you are planning to make American energy great again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=36.64s)]
*  Well, President Trump, with his courageous leadership last Tuesday, with that executive order, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=43.52s)]
*  really put in place and put in motion a triple win for America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=48.8s)]
*  Coal is such important, so foundational to what we do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=54.0s)]
*  Number one, thermal coal for electricity. And we've got incredible demand coming, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=57.44s)]
*  whether it's all the manufacturing coming back to the U.S. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  or whether it's for powering AI, manufacturing intelligence in the United States, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=66.64s)]
*  and then keeping prices down for all consumers. So we need more baseload electricity. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=71.52s)]
*  Coal provides that. Number two is the plant that I was at in Alabama, the mine there, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=76.8s)]
*  this is metallurgical coal. This is essential for steelmaking. And of course, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=82.72s)]
*  through the regulatory regime that's gone against coal since Obama took office, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=87.28s)]
*  we've nearly killed not just the coal industry but the steel industry in this country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=92.0s)]
*  And this metallurgical coal coming out of this mine is absolutely essential. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=97.28s)]
*  Of course, we need steel for shipbuilding, trying to get back in the shipbuilding business, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  where we've lost all of that. China producing over half the ships in the world. The U.S. is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  not even in the top 20 on shipbuilding anymore. And then the third thing is in the coal. We've [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=109.76s)]
*  got critical minerals in those coals, and we're completely dependent on China for 85 percent of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=115.76s)]
*  the refined critical minerals. So whether it's electricity, whether it's for steelmaking, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  whether it's for critical minerals, coal is a triple win. And President Trump, he understands [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=124.72s)]
*  that, and he's paving the way for American revival. So it's truly a national security issue, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=129.6s)]
*  as obviously you and President Trump understand. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=137.28s)]
*  If you're concerned about the sort of environmental aspects of all of this, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=141.44s)]
*  when you look at the way the United States uses coal versus the way somebody like China uses coal, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=145.76s)]
*  explain the difference there between those. Well, there's really no comparison. And of course, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=153.52s)]
*  as President Trump likes to say about the U.S., it's beautiful, clean coal is what we've got [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  right here in America. And if there's a coal plant operating in America, it's clean. Since 2008, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=166.24s)]
*  the regulatory attacks against the coal industry, we've shut down so much coal in this country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  We've been shutting down baseload. And as Rachel said at the top, China adding all these plants, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  they've added in the last year 94 gigawatts. That's one gigawatt powers Denver. They've added [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=183.52s)]
*  94 Denvers worth of coal electricity, and they're doing it with 1970s technology, no emissions [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=188.8s)]
*  control. U.S., we do it cleaner, smarter, safer, healthier than anyone else in the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=194.8s)]
*  Americans ought to be insisting that every ounce of liquid fuel, every electron is made in the U.S. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  And if we're not producing electricity here, we lose the A.I. arms race to China, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=207.12s)]
*  and that's a race we can't lose. That's like, would be like losing the nuclear race. We have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=212.08s)]
*  to do that. We need more electricity. We need more metallurgical coal for making steel and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  shipbuilding, and we need the critical minerals. And so like I said, triple win for America for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=222.56s)]
*  beautiful clean coal. You did a awesome event. Many people who watched the speech that Trump gave [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=226.72s)]
*  on Capitol Hill, you swore in DJ Daniel, this kid that just captivated the nation. What can you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=233.52s)]
*  tell us about that event? And what was that experience like for that kid? Well, he's a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=240.32s)]
*  remarkable young man. He's gone through over a dozen brain surgeries. He won the hearts of America [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=246.4s)]
*  on the night of President Trump's address to both chambers, and he's got a goal. He loves law [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=254.0s)]
*  enforcement. He's trying to be sworn into as many law enforcement organizations as he can, and we [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=261.44s)]
*  were happy to host him, the National Park Police, one of the oldest police force in America, created [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=268.24s)]
*  by George Washington in 1791. We brought him in. We swore him in in the secretary's office at the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=272.88s)]
*  Department of Interior, the National Park Police are a part of that. The monuments in Washington, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=279.28s)]
*  D.C. fall under the National Park Service. And then he went on patrol. He was in uniform. He had [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=284.32s)]
*  his badge. He was out and they were checking on the monuments and he was helping serve our country [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=290.64s)]
*  yesterday afternoon. Incredible family, incredible parents, and incredible young man. Very inspiring [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=296.32s)]
*  story. It is beautiful. He's been sworn in over 800 times. So that's pretty impressive. He's going [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=302.72s)]
*  for a thousand. He's DJ. DJ is going for a thousand. He's going to have the world record. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=309.36s)]
*  It's amazing. Well, he was bullied, by the way, at one point for loving law enforcement, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=313.68s)]
*  and it's so nice to see you, Secretary, embracing him and the nation really embracing this young [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  man and in an extension embracing law enforcement. Until he starts writing speeding tickets, then it's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=324.72s)]
*  going to be a problem. All right, Secretary. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKThn3zL0oU&t=329.44s)]
