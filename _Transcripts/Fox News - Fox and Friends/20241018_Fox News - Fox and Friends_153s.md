# Trump joins Lawrence Jones at NYC barber shop: 'I could have stayed for two hours'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0)
*  And Mr. President, you're gaining with minorities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=0.0s)]
*  And you know, I've been going across the country [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=2.2s)]
*  to these barber shops. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=3.6s)]
*  Yesterday, you said you wanted to go. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=5.12s)]
*  So we went to the Bronx yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=6.88s)]
*  Here's a little bit of what we saw at the barber shop. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=8.96s)]
*  You guys are the same as me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=12.88s)]
*  It's the same stuff. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=14.32s)]
*  We were born the same way. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=15.48s)]
*  I grew up in Queens and all of that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=18.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, I had a great father. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=20.12s)]
*  I had a father who was a great guy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=22.48s)]
*  He was tough but good, big heart, big, big heart. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=24.16s)]
*  And he was a construction guy, pretty much, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=28.2s)]
*  and a real estate guy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=30.84s)]
*  And I learned a lot from him. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=32.76s)]
*  He was great. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=34.04s)]
*  But I know you people so well without knowing you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=34.88s)]
*  I know you so well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=38.16s)]
*  When I walked in here, I said, this is home territory. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=39.36s)]
*  So Mr. President, we're gonna play the full thing on Monday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  But what was that experience like? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=46.6s)]
*  There was so much love in the room. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=48.36s)]
*  It was like people that I grew up with, actually. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=50.28s)]
*  You know, all different types, everything perfect. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=52.92s)]
*  The area was incredible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=56.0s)]
*  The traffic, there were thousands and many thousands [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=57.24s)]
*  of people standing outside this barbershop. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  The owner was great with the son. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=63.08s)]
*  The son is actually the owner. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  He's already made that passage. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=65.76s)]
*  But the people were fantastic. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=67.44s)]
*  We could have stayed there for two hours, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=69.88s)]
*  It was great. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think they're giving you a shot? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=72.8s)]
*  They haven't voted for Republicans in years like this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=74.76s)]
*  So what are you doing on the ground differently [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=78.04s)]
*  than attracting black men, Hispanic men? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  I just saw a Hispanic poll room at 52%. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=84.12s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen that before. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=87.0s)]
*  Republicans have never been there before. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=88.32s)]
*  I'm at 52%. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=90.2s)]
*  And with black men, I'm at 32% and 31%. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=92.08s)]
*  This is sort of throwing their formulas off a little bit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=96.52s)]
*  You know, this is a little bit of a change. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=99.64s)]
*  But look, we ran a great country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=102.04s)]
*  We had everything going. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=104.88s)]
*  The world respected us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=106.08s)]
*  We had no wars. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=107.16s)]
*  This group will cause us World War III. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=108.72s)]
*  They have no idea what they're doing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=110.6s)]
*  And you know, I hate to talk that way, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=112.12s)]
*  but we can't let this woman get in. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=114.2s)]
*  It's two people. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=116.24s)]
*  And she's a very, and you talk about unstable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  She's a whack job. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  But how about the vice president? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=120.64s)]
*  How about Waltz? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=123.6s)]
*  I mean, he's not qualified to be doing this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  He is. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=127.44s)]
*  I mean, you have to look at the vice president very seriously. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=128.48s)]
*  And you compare him and JD Vance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=131.16s)]
*  JD Vance, number one at Yale. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, the whole thing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=134.88s)]
*  I mean, high academic. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, JD is doing a phenomenal job. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=139.2s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLg-7Yw6p0&t=142.8s)]
