# Dem senator visiting El Salvador to check on suspected MS-13 gang member
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4)
*  Happening today, a Democrat senator is traveling down to El Salvador to try to get a deported, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=0.0s)]
*  suspected migrant gang member back to the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=6.7s)]
*  It's really incredible when you think about it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=10.88s)]
*  This comes as other Democrats push for a welfare check at the mega prison where the worst of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=13.44s)]
*  the worst are being held. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=20.0s)]
*  Maybe let's just get his aura right. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=21.2s)]
*  Make a check on him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=22.8s)]
*  Griff Jenkins is live in Washington with more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=24.16s)]
*  So Griff, suddenly this is an issue that Democrats are embracing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=27.8s)]
*  Well they're rallying around it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=32.76s)]
*  Good morning Steve Ainslie, Brian and Lawrence. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=34.0s)]
*  And look, this may be a first we're going to witness today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=36.28s)]
*  A sitting U.S. Senator traveling to a foreign country to advocate for an illegal alien deemed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=38.88s)]
*  affiliated with MS-13 deported to his home country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=44.18s)]
*  But that's exactly what Maryland's Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen says he's doing today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=52.36s)]
*  I don't even know if we'd announce this, but I am planning tomorrow to go to El Salvador [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=53.44s)]
*  to work to bring him home. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=57.28s)]
*  The Trump administration themselves admitted in federal court that he was wrongfully abducted [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=64.84s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=73.16s)]
*  And he's not the only Democrat rallying around Garcia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=74.16s)]
*  A federal judge ordering the Trump administration to facilitate his return. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=77.52s)]
*  As many as a dozen House Democrats want to follow Axios obtaining a letter from these [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=81.78s)]
*  representatives, Robert Garcia and Max Frost, requesting that Codel be authorized to travel [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=86.54s)]
*  on the taxpayer dime. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=91.38s)]
*  In the letter they write, a congressional delegation would allow committee members to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  conduct a welfare check on Mr. Abrego Garcia, as well as others held at Seacot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=96.58s)]
*  Now this, as Senator Van Hollen pays little notice to another one of his constituents, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=101.66s)]
*  Rachel Morin, the Maryland mother of five murdered by an illegal alien, Victor Martinez, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  found guilty this week of first degree premeditated murder and first degree rape. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  There was no press conference with Van Hollen standing in solidarity with the grieving Morin [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=116.94000000000001s)]
*  family, his office simply putting out a statement saying the verdict brought a quote measure [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=121.5s)]
*  of justice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  And there may be even more senators heading to El Salvador. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  Politico reporting this morning, guys, that Senator Cory Booker may be looking at making [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=130.58s)]
*  that trip as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=134.9s)]
*  Guys. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=136.94s)]
*  And a couple of members of Congress are asking James Comer to authorize a Codel so they can [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=137.94s)]
*  go down as well, both Democrats. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=142.46s)]
*  But also there was some action yesterday, Griff, at the federal court level, and that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=145.1s)]
*  is the judge who essentially said, OK, the federal government's got to facilitate bringing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=150.1s)]
*  him back. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=154.14s)]
*  Supreme Court said, you got to facilitate coming back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=155.14s)]
*  And now they put the administration on notice. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=158.26s)]
*  You got two weeks to tell me exactly how hard you've tried to bring the guy back. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=160.3s)]
*  That's right, Steve. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=166.26s)]
*  And Judge Paula Zinnis, the federal judge in this case, says that the Supreme Court [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=167.26s)]
*  backed her up in that facilitation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  The administration fighting over the word facilitating return does not demand actual [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=173.54s)]
*  return. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=179.18s)]
*  She's actually given the term administration basically until tomorrow to explain why he [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=180.18s)]
*  hasn't been brought back with this tougher deadline. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=184.74s)]
*  But I think what's going to be interesting as this all plays out is the parallel political [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=189.5s)]
*  track, because it'll be interesting to see what Tom Homan has to say to you guys, because [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=194.94s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen keeps using the word abducted, illegally. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=199.78s)]
*  Brigham Garcia was illegally abducted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  And there's nothing in the language or in the case that dates back to 2019 that he was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=206.42s)]
*  abducted. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=211.42s)]
*  He was brought in and deemed for removal, just not specifically to El Salvador. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=212.42s)]
*  Steve? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=216.38s)]
*  Maybe you know, Griff, the proceedings on this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=217.38s)]
*  I don't understand why James Comer's got to give permission for Democrats to have a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  codel just so they don't have to pull the money out of their pocket. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=224.42s)]
*  To authorize, look, as you know, Congress holds the purse strings and the party in power. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  James Comer is the chairman, so he would have to authorize ultimately and sign off on spending [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=233.54s)]
*  taxpayer dime to send these Democrats down on this codel to do whatever they're going [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=238.78s)]
*  to do to advocate on the case of an illegal alien deported back to his home country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=250.5s)]
*  I didn't know the majority was in charge of that too, but thanks so much, Griff. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=251.5s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  Because they need security and also oversight. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  I just thought the majority could ask for it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=256.98s)]
*  They can ask, but James Comer can say no. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=259.62s)]
*  However, Van Hollen is going. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=262.3s)]
*  He's there today. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=264.5s)]
*  The bottom line is, Rachel Moran was a part of his district. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  From Maryland. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=271.98s)]
*  And I've spent the entire morning trying to find his public comments. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=272.98s)]
*  I can only find the statement from yesterday when the person was convicted of murdering [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=276.02s)]
*  her. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=280.18s)]
*  He didn't say anything. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=281.18s)]
*  There were no protests. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=282.18s)]
*  This is the type of stuff that really ticks off the American people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=284.3s)]
*  When our citizens die, when they're brutally raped, there's no outrage from the media or [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=287.74s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=294.1s)]
*  But suddenly, this guy, by the way, the only thing that's in dispute now is where he was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=295.1s)]
*  deported. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=300.58s)]
*  That's the only thing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=301.58s)]
*  Caroline, love it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=304.58s)]
*  We have so much to say on this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=305.58s)]
*  I want to play this sound bite and then I want to play Rachel Moran's mom's sound bite [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=306.58s)]
*  and then I want to get into the meat of this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=310.06s)]
*  Here's Caroline Levitt at the White House. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=311.06s)]
*  It's mind boggling, the priorities of the modern day Democrat Party. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=313.94s)]
*  I think it's atrocious that you have Democrats in Congress on Capitol Hill who swear an oath [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=318.74s)]
*  to protect their constituents and to serve them in Washington, D.C., spending more time [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=324.58s)]
*  defending illegal immigrant gang members than their own constituents and law abiding American [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=330.9s)]
*  citizens like Rachel Moran. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=336.5s)]
*  I'm very angry. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=340.3s)]
*  I'm actually outraged, but I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=341.3s)]
*  There was no action on the Democratic Party in any way, from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=346.14s)]
*  my orcas, anyone here in Maryland, none of the senators, did anything to help search [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  for the murderer of my daughter. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=362.66s)]
*  So this is what's so upsetting. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=365.48s)]
*  You have this senator of Maryland, Senator Chris Van Hollen, who's going down there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=367.58s)]
*  He says the courts have ordered the safe return of my constituent. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=372.06s)]
*  He's talking about this MS-13. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=376.26s)]
*  Two courts said he's in MS-13. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=378.26s)]
*  ISIS confirmed he was in MS-13, which means he's a terrorist in our country. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=379.98s)]
*  So he gets kicked out of our country and now that's the constituent he cares about. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=384.46s)]
*  Is he even a constituent? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=388.98s)]
*  A constituent is a voting member of a community. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=389.98s)]
*  Can he vote in Maryland? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=392.34s)]
*  Not for a federal election, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=393.82s)]
*  So Patty Moran says, I live in this district. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=395.86s)]
*  He never came to visit me or my family. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=398.98s)]
*  I live in the same district. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=401.66s)]
*  He could have come over to my house and said, hey, and I didn't hear from Democrats. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=402.94s)]
*  She said, I didn't hear from Joe Biden, Kamala, may orcas or her senator. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=406.22s)]
*  She did hear from the governor, Wes Moore, but she said he didn't do anything about anything [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=410.98s)]
*  after that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, the reason she didn't hear from any Democrats is it's politically, it's a losing [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  proposition for them. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=421.86s)]
*  So what you're doing to go down to the prison. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=422.86s)]
*  It's true. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=425.22s)]
*  Listen, when somebody, it's two different, it's the same topic, but it's two different [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=425.74s)]
*  stories. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=429.82s)]
*  You know, the migrant kills the woman in Maryland. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=430.82s)]
*  That's one story. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=433.82s)]
*  But this one is so much better because the way the Democrats are spinning it is this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=434.94s)]
*  It was a El Salvadoran who is in the country legally and was, you know, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=438.54s)]
*  Which is not true. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=446.02s)]
*  No, he was. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=447.02s)]
*  No, he was not. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=448.02s)]
*  He had a final deportation order. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=449.02s)]
*  The only thing that's in dispute is where he was sent. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=452.02s)]
*  I can actually give you the background. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=455.02s)]
*  So he comes over at 16 by his parents, I guess so-called, he'd qualify as a dreamer, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=456.94s)]
*  whatever that means. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=461.62s)]
*  At 19, he gets picked up, or 20 years old, he gets picked up in front of a Home Depot. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=462.62s)]
*  And the Prince County cops come, Prince County cops pick him up and they go, this guy's here [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=466.38s)]
*  illegally. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=471.26s)]
*  He's a suspected gang member. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=472.26s)]
*  We're turning him over to ICE. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=473.26s)]
*  He ends up in front of a court and the judge, Elizabeth Kessler says, you're a verified [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=474.53999999999996s)]
*  You're a voided hearing and there's going to be evidence, so it's going to be coming [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=479.46s)]
*  up in eight months. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=483.62s)]
*  So on December 29th, he appealed because he was supposed to be deported. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=484.62s)]
*  And he says, they said, again, you're a member of MS-13. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=488.34s)]
*  He said, okay, before you kick me out of the country, I'd like to apply for asylum. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=490.58s)]
*  And they go, okay, you can apply for asylum. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=494.78s)]
*  I don't know what you're going to stand on. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=496.86s)]
*  He goes, but by the way, if you do kick me out, it looks like you're going to kick me [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=498.34s)]
*  out. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=501.38s)]
*  If you do kick me out, I'm going to say, whatever you do, don't kick me out to El Salvador. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=502.38s)]
*  He said, okay. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=508.74s)]
*  So they go, he is on a removal order, living from that time to 2025. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=510.14s)]
*  He's living here, knowing that he could be removed at any moment. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=516.14s)]
*  Now people say, okay, he could have been kicked out to any country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  Why did you put him in El Salvador? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=522.98s)]
*  Because Stephen Miller says yes, he goes, a couple of things. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=523.98s)]
*  The reason why you don't go to El Salvador is MS-13. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=526.74s)]
*  MS-13 has been eliminated as a threat because the El Salvador president arrested all of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=528.9s)]
*  them, neck tattoos and all. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=534.34s)]
*  So you could say on one count, he's been eliminated as a threat. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=535.76s)]
*  On the other count is MS-13, thanks to this president, is a terrorist. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=538.84s)]
*  Is a terrorist group. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=543.16s)]
*  So we're kicking you out for being a member of a terrorist group. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=544.68s)]
*  So this senator and the codel want to go down and visit the MS-13 member living on a removal [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=547.88s)]
*  order in Maryland. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  He's not an American. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=557.96s)]
*  He may be a dad, but it has nothing to do with his legal status. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=559.4s)]
*  And MS-13 is one of the most brutal gangs you will ever come across. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=563.7s)]
*  So that's who you're going to battle for, not an illegal immigrant. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  But my earlier point was the Democrats have seized on this to say, hey, this guy who was [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=571.7s)]
*  in the country and had an order not to get sent back there was grabbed and he was abducted. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=576.1s)]
*  I mean, that's what, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=580.6600000000001s)]
*  And that is what we're going to hear over and over as all of these Democrats line up [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=582.38s)]
*  to go down there. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  But people should know the truth about the situation. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  He is an illegal immigrant on a removal order. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=589.76s)]
*  And if you want to know why you're going to El Salvador, you say, well, the abandonment [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=593.04s)]
*  is taking him to El Salvador, but not getting him out of the country. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=596.5s)]
*  That's what Senator Van Hollen cares about. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=599.5s)]
*  Not Rachel Moran, not the illegals, not the 2.5 million here with criminal records that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=601.9s)]
*  stuck in over the last four years. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  Not that he cares about this clown. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=607.66s)]
*  So a lot of these illegal immigrants came in under the watch of Joe Biden. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=611.06s)]
*  They essentially just let the border open. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=616.3s)]
*  Now the border is 95% closed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=618.16s)]
*  And we'll show later in the show the difference. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=621.14s)]
*  Pictures before and after. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=623.18s)]
*  You're not going to be shocked. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=624.6999999999999s)]
*  Tom Homan's going to be. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=626.6999999999999s)]
*  Tom Homan will be on our show. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTu9J-3Ze4&t=628.78s)]
