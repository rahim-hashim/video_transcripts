# 'False official record': White House under fire for 'garbage' transcript
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc)
*  All right, it's 10 minutes after the top of the hour and House Republicans are accusing the White House of releasing an inaccurate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=0.0s)]
*  Transcript after Joe Biden's garbage remark. They do it all the time. Yep [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=6.16s)]
*  Lucas, Thomas and is live at the White House with the lake with the latest. Hey Lucas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=10.64s)]
*  Well, good morning guys with less than a week to go before election day [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=14.76s)]
*  Who thought we'd be talking about garbage and apostrophes? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=18.18s)]
*  But here we are this all started with of course President Biden's zoom called Latino voters on Tuesday night. Here it is. I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=21.42s)]
*  Don't know the Puerto Rican that I know or Puerto Rico where I'm in my home state of Delaware [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=28.26s)]
*  They're good decent honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=34.54s)]
*  His is his demonization seen as unconscionable and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  Here's the official White House transcript note the apostrophe there on the word supporters the White House press secretary [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  responded yesterday [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=51.82s)]
*  Just to clarify he was not calling Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=54.02s)]
*  Supporters garbage, which is why he put out. This is why he wanted to make sure that we put out a statement that clarified [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=57.099999999999994s)]
*  What he meant and what he was trying to say and so just want to make that very clear for folks who are watching [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=64.78s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris is distancing herself from Biden's zoom call while he was she was speaking on the ellipse [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=70.58s)]
*  Harris told reporters she strongly disagrees with any criticism of people based on who they vote for the Harris campaign [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  Of course wanted her big speech to be the focus now what many see is an unforced error by Biden like Yankee pitcher [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=83.22s)]
*  Garret Cole not covering first with two outs in the fifth leading to a five run inning to tie the game a lesson to our young [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=89.02s)]
*  Viewers guys always run hard to first like Mookie Betts did but I digress back to that apostrophe in the transcript House [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=94.74s)]
*  Republicans are calling that transcript a false official record writing quote instead of apologizing or [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=101.34s)]
*  Instead of apologizing or clarifying President Biden's words the way I was instead sought to change them despite them being recorded on video by [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  Releasing a false transcript of his remarks White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the president of the United States to be more [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=116.14s)]
*  politically on [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=123.22s)]
*  Message so guys the lessons learned perhaps if Hillary Clinton had just added an apostrophe to the word deplorables that could have blown over [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=124.22s)]
*  Guys, that's a good point [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=130.98s)]
*  So Lucas the fact that House oversight the Republicans there are are making an issue of this is set, you know [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=132.73999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, they'll probably just add the apostrophe and that'll be it [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=138.98s)]
*  But it keeps it in the news another day and it's another day closer to the election [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=142.06s)]
*  It sure does Stephen. That's why we're talking about it today. Is that official transcript and many people they heard the video [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  It's why you played at the top of this hit [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=154.06s)]
*  It was pretty clear that the president said supporters now what the White House is saying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=155.94s)]
*  He was talking about the comedian on stage, but of course, that's not what he said in our business [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=160.14s)]
*  Sometimes you have to take people at their word not what we think they said exactly. All right. Thanks Lucas [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=165.22s)]
*  Thank you, sir. No, I'm sucking a little sports reporter there. Probably gonna be upset. I heard that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, did y'all watch the White House briefing yesterday some of the reporters going back and forth [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=179.38s)]
*  Why is this even up for debate? There's some reporters that still like well, okay [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=184.18s)]
*  Maybe he did say [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm like you could hear we have the clip where you hear him say [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=191.06s)]
*  Yeah, he came to a stop after support and they're debating on if he said it or not [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=195.26s)]
*  Just just apologize. It sounded plural not not possessive. So where does the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  Their acute the Republicans are accusing them of releasing this false transcript, but what about does this like go in the official records? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=205.94s)]
*  But they change it all the time, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=213.42s)]
*  All the time they clean it up [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=216.58s)]
*  One person that's not partisan that writes those it's the communications wing of the White House [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=219.10000000000002s)]
*  They're the one to do it matter if it's a Republican or Democrat you you put in the official book whatever was really set [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=225.38000000000002s)]
*  That's right. Well, here's the thing. We know what has been said. We just played you the entire clip [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  It's not the first time Joe Biden has called out Trump supporters. Let's hop in the way back machine folks [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ec4z1-2Wc&t=236.94s)]
