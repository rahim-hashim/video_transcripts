# Alina Habba issues warning for those 'trying to step' in Trump's way
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw)
*  federal workers now have until tomorrow to decide whether to take a buyout after a federal judge extended their deadline. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=0.0s)]
*  This, as both sides will be in court to argue over the president's plan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=7.12s)]
*  Alina Habba serves as counselor to President Trump and she joins us now. Great to see you, Alina, this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's kind of interesting right now. We have a couple of things going on in the courts right now [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=18.44s)]
*  where you have federal judges stepping in trying to interfere with the president of the United States efforts to bring sanity to within his own administration, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=23.56s)]
*  within the executive branch of which he is the chief executive. How is this going to work out? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=35.08s)]
*  Right. Well, this isn't anything new. We've seen this for the last four years. This is the weaponization of our justice system. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=40.76s)]
*  So thank God we have Pam Bondi and now as attorney general, because it's not going to stand. We did expect it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=49.08s)]
*  We understand that there are some very inappropriate, radical judges that are seeing this as a platform to elevate themselves and get a headline. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=55.2s)]
*  We don't have any time for it. And President Trump's agenda is the one that the American people voted on on November 5th. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=65.8s)]
*  It's really not President Trump. It's what they wanted. And that's the way our country works. It's a republic. That's how it goes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=70.84s)]
*  So we'll deal with them in court. This is obviously not something we're not familiar with doing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=78.32s)]
*  And there will be repercussions, frankly, for those that try and go after President Trump's orders, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  for those people that are trying to step in his way and his agenda, which is the American people's agenda. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=91.28s)]
*  Well, it is a constitutional conflict here. And it kind of amazes me that more people don't see it, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  especially Democrats who complain that, say, Elon Musk is not elected when, of course, these federal judges are certainly not elected. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=101.96s)]
*  And the only one who is elected is President Trump, who is trying to do what he was elected to do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=109.0s)]
*  Do you see this going all the way to the high court or do you see this as something that will get settled before that point? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=116.92s)]
*  It should be settled before that, but they're relentless and they're desperate, as we've seen. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=127.0s)]
*  And as you pointedly said, there's something called the separation of powers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=131.16s)]
*  There's something called the government has different departments. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=135.08s)]
*  He is the executive branch of the government, the leader of the free world. And this is the way it's supposed to go. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=140.32s)]
*  But again, like I said, this is a weaponization that was created under the Biden administration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=146.04s)]
*  We're seeing them cry and scream and they need to adjust to reality. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=150.44s)]
*  And they're having a hard time with that. But we're going to have to fight it. We know that we're ready for it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=154.12s)]
*  And when these decisions were made, they were vetted. They went through White House counsel's office. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=158.72s)]
*  They went through all the right elements of our administration to make sure that they will withstand any challenges that we get from radical left. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=162.16s)]
*  Well, I appreciate the fact that you are standing there making this good, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=170.28s)]
*  important fight over such important constitutional issues and serving the country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=174.88s)]
*  And thank you for joining us this morning, Alina Habba. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=179.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEbwcBuDIw&t=183.20000000000002s)]
