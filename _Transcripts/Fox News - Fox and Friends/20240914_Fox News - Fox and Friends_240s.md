# ‘ON THE MARCH’: Putin already sees himself at war with the West, Kurt Volker warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI)
*  Well, two Russian jets were detected and tracked on Friday in the Alaska Air Defense Identification [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=0.0s)]
*  Zone, marking the second detection this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=9.28s)]
*  This comes as Russia and China held the largest military drills since the Soviet era, which [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=13.14s)]
*  included 90,000 troops, 400 warships and 120 planes and helicopters. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=18.16s)]
*  But Joe Biden is brushing off Putin's threats to attack NATO if Ukraine is allowed to strike [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=24.44s)]
*  inside Russia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=30.76s)]
*  What do you say to Vladimir Putin's threat of war, Mr. President? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=31.76s)]
*  I don't think much about Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  Here to react former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Kurt, thanks for being here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=43.84s)]
*  Why are, why have Russia and China been driven together and why are we seeing such robust [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=46.0s)]
*  exercises near one of our states? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=52.32s)]
*  Well, they share an interest in disrupting the global world order that has existed for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=55.32s)]
*  70 years and created peace for the last 70 years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=60.64s)]
*  China wants everything to revolve around itself and it wants to replace the United States. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=64.4s)]
*  Russia is just trying to rebuild the Russian Empire, so they share a little bit of a common [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  interest. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=73.48s)]
*  But let's be clear, in this, Russia is the junior partner, China is actually the big [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=74.48s)]
*  concern. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=79.4s)]
*  They're doing these exercises just as a way to try to get under our skin. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, Kurt, we're, at this point, there's talk of Western approved long range missiles [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=85.8s)]
*  into Russia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't that lead to an escalation that Vladimir Putin could use as a justification [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  to widen the war? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=102.46s)]
*  Are we not making a wider war more likely by approving something like that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=103.88s)]
*  Actually, I think if Vladimir Putin could escalate, he would already be doing it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=110.48s)]
*  I don't think he's gone into Ukraine just in a half measure effort saying, oh, maybe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=115.4s)]
*  I'll take it, maybe I won't. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=120.8s)]
*  He's throwing everything at this he can. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=122.64s)]
*  He is literally trying to overthrow the government, take over the entire country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=125.28s)]
*  And his forces have bogged down in eastern Ukraine to some degree. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=130.28s)]
*  He's not able to defend other parts of Russia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=134.28s)]
*  And he's doing this from bases inside Russia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=137.16s)]
*  So basically by telling the Ukrainians, oh, don't hit back, we're basically telling them, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=140.36s)]
*  give Russia a sanctuary. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=145.0s)]
*  They can come strike you and then go home and be safe. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=146.36s)]
*  But that's if you're talking about the war in a vacuum. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=150.32s)]
*  Like, OK, but by allowing the West to use, Ukraine to use Western made missiles and approving [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=152.96s)]
*  it from NATO countries into Russia, you are giving him license to widen the war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=160.44s)]
*  You're making it more likely that America gets directly involved. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=165.76s)]
*  How is that in our interest? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=168.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, first off, we're not directly involved. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=170.8s)]
*  But more importantly, Putin already sees himself as at war with the West. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=173.36s)]
*  They've conducted cyberattacks, they've conducted targeted assassinations, they've conducted [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=178.44s)]
*  arsons, and they are literally trying to take over Ukraine in order then to threaten other [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=182.72s)]
*  allies that we actually do have to defend in Europe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=189.88s)]
*  So Putin is actually on the march here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=193.0s)]
*  It's very important that Ukraine stops him so we don't face a bigger problem. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=196.6s)]
*  Real quick, do you really think Vladimir Putin wants to go to Paris, to Munich? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=200.0s)]
*  Paris? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=205.2s)]
*  Paris? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=206.2s)]
*  No. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=207.2s)]
*  The Baltic states? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=208.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=209.2s)]
*  Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, parts of Poland? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=210.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=212.24s)]
*  Finland? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=213.24s)]
*  I would watch out because that also used to be part of the Russian Empire. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=214.24s)]
*  So it's reuniting the USSR in your view, which I think is more astute than believing he wants [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=217.48s)]
*  to go all the way through Europe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=223.44s)]
*  Kurt Volker, thank you for your time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=224.44s)]
*  I appreciate your insight. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2M7dbXAqQI&t=226.39999999999998s)]
