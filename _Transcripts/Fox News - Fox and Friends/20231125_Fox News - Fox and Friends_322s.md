# Biden admin will have to use leverage if Americans aren't released, warns Morgan Ortagus
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI)
*  Today has been a product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=0.0s)]
*  From the moment Hamas kidnapped these people, I along with my team have worked around the clock [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=4.32s)]
*  to secure the release. Today's release are the start of a process. We expect more hostages to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  be released tomorrow and more the day after and more the day after that. We return with a Fox News [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  alert. That's President Biden touting America's involvement in the release of 13 Israeli hostages [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=21.2s)]
*  from Hamas captivity. Yet still no Americans have been released this go around, but we're [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=26.96s)]
*  expecting more hostages to be released today. Here with her take, former State Department [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=32.0s)]
*  spokesperson Morgan Ortegas. Good morning, Morgan. Thanks for joining us. Give us your [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=36.88s)]
*  perspective of this. There are a lot of takes in several directions. Is this good? Is it bad? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  What's next? Well, Joey, I mean, listen, as you watch the videos online and you see the families [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=48.16s)]
*  reunited, not only the Children, I was just watching a video of 85 year old Yafa Adar. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=54.88s)]
*  She actually survived the Holocaust. She survived the Holocaust to see the state of Israel formed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  only towards the end of her life to be kidnapped by Hamas terrorist and use effectively as a human [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=66.72s)]
*  shield in Gaza. And you see you see her being reunited after family. You think what this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  woman has been through. And of course, the images that we're seeing of the Children being [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  reunited, especially the little Children and their mother believe there's two sets of mothers [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=83.04s)]
*  and Children that have been reunited. And so your heart is filled with joy for those people. But [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=87.04s)]
*  of course, we as Americans remember that we still have Americans left behind and the president did [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  not have a good answer yesterday for when we're going to get them out. And that needs to be the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  first and top priority for the president of the United States. And he's certainly going to owe [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  the American people answers if we don't have them out soon. But listen, we're doing this is being a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  part of the State Department being with Mike Pompeo being with Brian Hook and Robert O'Brien. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=111.76s)]
*  As we negotiated for hostages around the world, I can tell you that this is one of the toughest [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=116.0s)]
*  things that you do. Unfortunately, this is one of the reasons I have been so critical [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=120.4s)]
*  of the Biden administration and their past hostage negotiations. Remember on the anniversary of 9 11, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  Joey, just a few weeks before October 7, the Biden administration gave $6 billion to Iran [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=132.0s)]
*  for us hostages. And I was critical back then because I said every time you said a bounty that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=138.56s)]
*  high, you make it harder and harder to get Americans out around the world. I unfortunately [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=143.36s)]
*  didn't realize how quickly I would be right about that. There are a lot of layers to this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  that I'd love to get into. But as someone that was at the State Department understands this type [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=152.16s)]
*  of diplomacy, what we saw yesterday, it didn't surprise me, my colleagues that are in DC, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=155.44s)]
*  but it surprised me a little bit seeing these citizens from Thailand being released kind of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  almost a separate deal. And I guess my question is, it seems like the U.S. is very much going to a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=164.4s)]
*  negotiation table with Egypt, Qatar, Israel, Hamas, but there are all these other countries [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=171.12s)]
*  that maybe are contacting Hamas directly. Will there come a point if American hostages aren't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=176.8s)]
*  released that the U.S. might go to Hamas directly or are they already? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, essentially what's happening right now in Qatar is you're having the United States, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  Israel, Qatar, others. Egypt is involved in the negotiations as well. And so, no, we're not [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=193.76s)]
*  talking to Hamas directly, but we are talking to them through the Qataris and through the Egyptians. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=199.44s)]
*  You'll remember that during the Taliban negotiations in 2019 and 2020, we were also [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=204.72s)]
*  using the Qataris in Doha. So we have done this before in Qatar. This is not a new role. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  However, the administration, if we don't get more Americans out today, we should know within hours [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  who the next list of 10 to 13 are that are getting out. If there aren't Americans on that list, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  this administration is going to have to use leverage. They're going to have to be very direct [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  with all of our negotiators, but especially with Hamas. This is also one of the reasons. And none [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  of this stuff happens in a vacuum, Joey. This is why three years of trying to appease Iran doesn't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  help the situation today, doesn't help get Americans home. Bad policy for three years on Iran [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=244.88000000000002s)]
*  directly affects what's happening today in Doha. Real quick on this, on the specific of getting [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=249.84s)]
*  Americans out, is there more pressure on the Biden administration to get Americans out or is there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=255.28s)]
*  more pressure coming from the Biden administration to Israel to get Americans out? Well, listen, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=260.24s)]
*  they're Americans, so there are responsibility ultimately. And we have been, you know, I think, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=266.64s)]
*  thankfully, except for the extreme fringes, we have been, there has been a bipartisan consensus [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=272.0s)]
*  that have been supportive of the state of Israel. That needs to continue. I very much worry, of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=277.2s)]
*  course, what we're seeing on the extreme left. But ultimately, the responsibility of any president [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=282.32s)]
*  of the United States is to get Americans home. And remember, during COVID, Joey, we had to get, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=287.12s)]
*  I was a part of the team that had to get 100,000 Americans home. We had to repatriate them from [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  around the world. So this is tough. These are tough issues, but they can be done with a strong [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=297.2s)]
*  president and a strong secretary of state. Morgan Ortega, thank you so much for bringing your [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzqnD5UPqI&t=301.91999999999996s)]
