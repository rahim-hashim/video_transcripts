# BREAKING: FEMA employees fired over 'egregious' migrant payments
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs)
*  Fox News alert moments ago we received this together. We received a statement from the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=0.0s)]
*  DHS regarding the 59 million dollars sent from FEMA to New York City migrants last week [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=5.92s)]
*  quote four employees being fired today for circumventing leadership and unilaterally [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=11.9s)]
*  making the egregious payment for hotels for migrants in New York City. We have not announced [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=17.48s)]
*  it yet. So you have so we have it first. There's going to be firing to names are going to be [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=24.16s)]
*  out and let's bring in New York Congressman Mike Lauer. Congressman your thought about that move. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  Well it's long overdue frankly. These funds have been misappropriated going back to the Biden [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=38.4s)]
*  administration and New York City a sanctuary city has been wasting billions of dollars of taxpayer [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=46.64s)]
*  money billions with a B to provide free housing clothing food education and health care to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=56.52s)]
*  illegal immigrants including criminal aliens that are here illegally. And so you know I [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=64.0s)]
*  applaud frankly DHS for taking action to stop these payments under President Trump's leadership [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=70.4s)]
*  because we have incentivized cities like New York and states like New York a sanctuary state [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=79.32s)]
*  to allow this to continue and it has to stop. Look it costs New York and its little salvage of us [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  billions of dollars because the water was wide open for four years and the mayor that spoke up [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=94.28s)]
*  got exiled in the Democratic Party. Ironically he's about to be I guess in a way pardoned or [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=100.28s)]
*  or protected by this president who sees a lot of the targeting of Mayor Eric Adams as the same [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=107.8s)]
*  thing that happened to him. No question Eric Adams spoke out against what the Biden administration [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=114.2s)]
*  was doing. He said that the migrant crisis was quote unquote destroying New York City. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=121.16s)]
*  Kathy Hochul authorized billions of dollars of state taxpayer money to pay for all these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=126.92s)]
*  expenditures. Meanwhile she's fleecing hard-working New Yorkers $2,500 just for the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=134.84s)]
*  privilege of driving to work. It really just speaks volumes to how inept incompetent and corrupt [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=141.08s)]
*  New York has become under feckless leadership. We have to stop this massive influx at the border [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=148.12s)]
*  which is what President Trump is doing but we have to stop incentivizing states and cities like New [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  York by spending billions and in this case from FEMA $59 million to support their efforts to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=161.0s)]
*  circumvent federal law. That's really what this boils down to. States like New York are circumventing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=169.88s)]
*  federal law allowing illegal immigrants to get benefits and access to taxpayer money. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=176.28s)]
*  All right so let's talk about something else that's just bizarre that it's happening in New York. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=183.88s)]
*  New York's top court said to consider non-citizen voting in New York City elections today. Get this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=187.64s)]
*  non-citizens you don't belong here you're not registered blowing off court appearance doesn't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=193.32s)]
*  matter that would add 800,000 non-citizen voters. Why is this even a discussion? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=197.64s)]
*  It shouldn't be. New York Republicans fought back against this effort several years ago. We were [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=204.6s)]
*  victorious in the lower court and the appellate division and now it goes to the court of appeals. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Unfortunately I'm a little bit concerned because the New York court of appeals has been corrupted [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=216.92s)]
*  by Kathy Hochul and New York Democrats. This is why they tried to gerrymander our maps again last [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=223.88s)]
*  year. They added people who are way too progressive for the court to try and move the court in a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  different direction. I am concerned certainly that the court of appeals will make a political decision [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=239.72s)]
*  and not follow the constitution. It is very clear non-citizens do not have the right to vote [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=246.76s)]
*  in our elections period. There's a reason New York is a sanctuary state and city though and the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=254.12s)]
*  reason is they want illegal immigrants counted as part of the census. That gives them more [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=259.88s)]
*  congressional seats and it gives them more electoral votes. That's what this all boils down [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=265.88s)]
*  to. They want them to be able to vote in our elections. I fundamentally believe that it is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=270.68s)]
*  wrong. It violates both the U.S. and New York state constitutions and needs to be prohibited. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  If the court had any courage or any conviction at all it will reject this outright today. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  You would think because they want to loosen up that. Next thing you know non-citizens voting in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=292.52s)]
*  general elections. They'll figure out a way to do that. You know what I think it is? Republicans [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=296.04s)]
*  getting very close in New York to winning a lot of traditional democratic seats. Maybe even the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=300.36s)]
*  governor's mansion and they got to start letting everybody know that we're going to have to maybe [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=304.6s)]
*  bend the rules a little to stay in power. Mike Lohler thanks so much. Thanks Brian. All right [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  congressman and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fDA-G5nTLs&t=313.48s)]
