# Blue states form a resistance group against Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ)
*  As Trump wins back the White House, Democratic governors, including several potential 2028 contenders, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  are now vowing to protect their states from Donald Trump's policies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=7.0s)]
*  The group is called Governors Safeguarding Democracy, and it's being dubbed as a nonpartisan group, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=11.5s)]
*  an alliance vowing to oppose whatever Trump's second term might bring. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=18.5s)]
*  Here with reaction is former executive director for draft Biden in 2016, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=23.5s)]
*  and a former senior advisor to Bernie Sanders, Mr. Will Pierce. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Hey Will, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=31.5s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Lainey. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=33.0s)]
*  You're welcome. All right, tell us about this group. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=34.5s)]
*  It's a resistance group against Trump. It's called Governors Safeguarding Democracy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=36.5s)]
*  Why do these governors, some of these Democratic governors, come together, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=40.5s)]
*  Governor Pritzker of Illinois, Governor Polis of Colorado, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=43.0s)]
*  to write this and give this playbook to other governors? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=47.0s)]
*  Overall, I just personally think it's an uncivil what they're doing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=51.0s)]
*  President Trump hasn't even been elected or inaugurated into office yet, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=54.0s)]
*  and he had these governors coming out against him automatically. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=57.5s)]
*  Overall, I just think that they should be respecting the will of the constituents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=60.0s)]
*  For example, in Illinois, for example, 44% of the state voted for Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=63.5s)]
*  Colorado, 43% voted for Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=67.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=69.5s)]
*  And now you have these governors coming out and they're saying, oh no, we're going to oppose. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=70.0s)]
*  They don't even know what the administration is going to be doing yet. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=74.0s)]
*  They're just sitting here and they're just trying to get their campaign ready for the next presidential election. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=76.0s)]
*  I agree with you, Will. When we reached out to both of the governor's offices, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=80.5s)]
*  they just sent us the press releases. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=83.5s)]
*  Or one of the articles I was reading, that's what they said. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=85.5s)]
*  They said the press releases to that publication didn't ever respond to this, really. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=87.5s)]
*  But they wrote a press release, so that means this is not a secret. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=93.0s)]
*  They're not writing this playbook and giving it out to governors. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=96.5s)]
*  They say it's nonpartisan, but I don't think they have any... [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=100.0s)]
*  They haven't heard back from any of the Republican governors. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=103.5s)]
*  They're not going to get the support from the Republican governors. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=105.5s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=108.0s)]
*  Have you heard behind the scenes there are Republican governors that are wanting this playbook? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=109.5s)]
*  Absolutely not. What I am actually hearing behind the scenes a little bit though, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=116.0s)]
*  is that you actually have government news coming in and getting involved as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=119.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry, if you just look at these cities and look at these communities that these governors are representing, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=123.0s)]
*  you have Chicago, San Francisco, LA. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=127.0s)]
*  These governors should be more focused on getting their communities back on track instead of sitting here worrying about... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=129.5s)]
*  I agree. I agree. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=134.0s)]
*  Governor Polis was on another network and he said we are going to work with him, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=135.0s)]
*  meaning Donald Trump and his administration, however we can for our state. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=138.5s)]
*  So why would you start this resistance group, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=142.5s)]
*  especially when a big portion of your state has voted for Donald Trump? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=144.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's unseparable. Let's take it a step further. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=149.5s)]
*  We know what this is really about. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=152.5s)]
*  Sitting here and they're already... [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=153.5s)]
*  They're going to be defending the illegal immigrants and working to keep them inside their states. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=155.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, you have so many resources being taken away by these states. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=160.0s)]
*  You have out of control crime. You have housing crisis. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=163.5s)]
*  And you have these governors focus on these issues instead of focus on what's going on in their own home state. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=171.0s)]
*  We haven't even had an inauguration and they're already against him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=172.0s)]
*  Day one. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=175.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Will, for coming on. Great to see you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6mQo7oLqDQ&t=176.0s)]
