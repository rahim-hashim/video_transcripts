# Why Elon Musk will pay Trump $10 MILLION
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI)
*  The Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOJ, securing two big court wins, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=0.0s)]
*  with one judge restoring Trump's federal buyout program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=4.86s)]
*  Another ruling the administration can limit access to federal funds under certain conditions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=8.36s)]
*  Peter Ducey joins us live from the White House. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=13.64s)]
*  Were these programs, Peter, did they DOJ a bullet? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  They did DOJ a bullet. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=19.64s)]
*  And a federal judge is also telling unions trying to stop the federal workforce buyout [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=21.52s)]
*  to stop it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=27.76s)]
*  This ruling came down from a federal judge in Massachusetts, and part of it says about [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=29.16s)]
*  this Fork in the Road Directive, the unions do not have the required direct stake in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Fork Directive. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=39.56s)]
*  This is not sufficient. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=40.88s)]
*  Second, this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff's pleaded claims. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=41.88s)]
*  So far the Trump team believes they've shrunk in the federal workforce by about 3 percent. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=47.88s)]
*  By the deadline, 75,000 people said they wanted to take the offered buyout, so long as it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=52.16s)]
*  holds up in court and Congress funds the eight months of pay and benefits, that is going [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=57.6s)]
*  to be 75,000 fewer federal workers. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Another win for the White House yesterday, a different federal judge in Rhode Island [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=66.12s)]
*  has ruled the president and his advisors can cut or freeze federal spending as long as [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  existing laws on the books are being followed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=76.44s)]
*  They're taking massive amounts of money and spending it on items. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=80.92s)]
*  I went through a list of 200 expenditures that were made, and I found three that looked [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=85.56s)]
*  like they were reasonable. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=91.56s)]
*  I want to commend Elon because he's done a fantastic, he doesn't need this, you know, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=92.8s)]
*  he's abused by you people every day. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=97.24s)]
*  He's found more things than anybody could find. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=99.92s)]
*  I think he's got the credibility to do it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=102.28s)]
*  I know he does. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=104.16s)]
*  President Trump said he's going to have a press conference about this at some point [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=106.36s)]
*  later on today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  We would expect that to be just what he thinks the highlights of Doge are because there's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  a lot that they have been doing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=114.92s)]
*  Doge says they canceled 58 contracts worth $150 million just yesterday. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=116.48s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=123.28s)]
*  Hey, Peter, real quick. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=124.28s)]
*  I know Elon and the president are pals. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Why is Elon paying Donald Trump $10 million? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=128.68s)]
*  Because Donald Trump sued Twitter before when it was called Twitter and before Elon owned [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=134.8s)]
*  they kicked him off the platform in 2001. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=141.12s)]
*  Trump has been settling lawsuits. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=144.96s)]
*  He also collected a big check, I think it was closer to $25 million from Metta for kicking [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=146.32s)]
*  him off Facebook and Instagram. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  So $10 million to the Trump account. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=152.68s)]
*  And I believe that they are putting most of this money that they're getting from media [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  companies and social media platforms, rather, towards the Trump presidential library to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=158.08s)]
*  open sometime after 2029. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=163.76s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=166.84s)]
*  So the president's going to have one heck of a library. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=167.84s)]
*  You know, after the first term, he wasn't even talking about it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=169.76s)]
*  Now by this one, I think it's going to be the nicest one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=172.16s)]
*  I could see him going into total. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  I wonder where it would be. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=176.12s)]
*  Well, see, that's the question. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=177.12s)]
*  Would it be here in New York or would it be in Florida? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=178.52s)]
*  And I bet they'll be in New Jersey. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=182.0s)]
*  You remember he has said he loves New Jersey. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=184.12s)]
*  He has said he wants to be buried at Bedminster in New Jersey. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=186.4s)]
*  I didn't know that either. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmcHcJJzXI&t=191.12s)]
