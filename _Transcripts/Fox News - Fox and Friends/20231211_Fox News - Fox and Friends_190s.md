# More than 100 Israeli soldiers killed in war against Hamas
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4)
*  Fox News alert Israeli government says Hamas terrorists are beginning to give up their fight as the idea continues to advance further into the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, Trey Yates is in southern Israel with the latest Trey. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=9.0s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. I do want to start with some breaking news here. Earlier today, rockets were fired once again toward Israel's second largest city of Tel Aviv, sending hundreds of thousands of people to bomb shelters. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=13.8s)]
*  The IDF says 10 of those rockets came from the Gaza Strip, one of them making a direct impact just south of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=25.3s)]
*  It comes as Israeli forces continue to make their way deeper into Gaza, focusing their efforts over the weekend on northern Gaza's Jabalia neighborhood. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=32.300000000000004s)]
*  You can see in this video here a reconnaissance unit operating in this area as they're engaged in close quarters combat. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=41.0s)]
*  You're looking here at the Nahal Infantry Brigade's 931st Battalion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  They say Hamas fighters had prepared an ambush but were thwarted. Since the ground operation began, 104 Israeli soldiers have been killed, and as the fiercest battles continue across Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has this warning for Hamas. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=52.300000000000004s)]
*  In recent days, dozens of Hamas terrorists have been surrendering to our forces. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=69.0s)]
*  They are laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters. It will take more time. The war is in full swing. But this is the beginning of the end of Hamas. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=74.6s)]
*  I say to Hamas terrorists, it is over. Don't die for Sinwar. Surrender now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=86.1s)]
*  He's talking about Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and the number one target for the Israelis. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=94.5s)]
*  Now, amid activity on the southern front, Israel remains prepared for battle on the northern front. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=100.5s)]
*  The chief of staff here, Herzl Halevi, visiting troops this weekend as Israel reportedly set a deadline for attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to push the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah away from the border with Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=105.7s)]
*  At this point, Israeli officials say they think there is a low chance of finding a diplomatic solution in the north. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=117.9s)]
*  Although the international focus does remain here on the southern front with Gaza, as there are still 137 hostages being held by Hamas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=132.3s)]
*  Hey Trey, as part of post-war Gaza, are they really recommending that Hamas be a junior partner? Don't they know that's a non-starter with the Israeli government? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=133.3s)]
*  I actually haven't seen that and according to the officials we are talking with, they will continue to push forward through Gaza until they completely degrade and destroy Hamas as an organization. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=142.9s)]
*  Now, some critics of the Israeli government say this simply isn't possible because so much of the organization is built around an ideology. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=156.10000000000002s)]
*  You not just have thousands of fighters inside Gaza, but also across the West Bank. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=163.3s)]
*  Hamas is extremely popular when it comes to being a political party. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=167.5s)]
*  So Israeli forces likely will continue to operate inside Gaza until they kill or capture senior Hamas leadership and destroy as many of the low-level fighters as possible. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=171.1s)]
*  But then you have this question, who controls Gaza next and what happens to the more than 2 million Palestinians living there? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=186.5s)]
*  Trey Yanks, great reporter. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXToJ9Zi8h4&t=187.5s)]
