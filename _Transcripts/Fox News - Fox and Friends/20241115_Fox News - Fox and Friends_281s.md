# Musk, Vivek's DOGE sends message to Americans
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc)
*  Doge Duo, accepting applications. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are looking for workers [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=4.24s)]
*  to help run the government efficiency department, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=7.44s)]
*  but warns the jobs are not for the faint of heart. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Posting this on X, quote, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=12.92s)]
*  we need super high IQ, small government revolutionaries [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=14.46s)]
*  willing to work 80 plus hours per week [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  on unglamorous cost cutting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=21.48s)]
*  Here to react is Fox and Friends Weekend co-host, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=23.68s)]
*  Will Kane. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=26.04s)]
*  Hey Will, do you think you're gonna get any takers [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=26.88s)]
*  with that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=28.7s)]
*  Will Kane, Ainsley? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=30.619999999999997s)]
*  Yes they will. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  Despite the fact that you or I or anyone watching might go, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=32.98s)]
*  wait a minute, 80 hours a week, no pay. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=36.3s)]
*  Doesn't sound like the best deal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=39.18s)]
*  I do believe in Elon Musk and more importantly, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=40.9s)]
*  I believe in President Donald Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  What I mean by that is this Ainsley, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=45.3s)]
*  as you read there in that post, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=46.68s)]
*  they're asking for small government revolutionaries, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=48.22s)]
*  people on the cause, ready to man the wall. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=50.14s)]
*  And this is what it's gonna take. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=53.58s)]
*  This is why I bring up Donald Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=54.9s)]
*  We're all watching what's happening this week. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=56.54s)]
*  And some people have concerns about nominations, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=58.6s)]
*  some people are celebrating nominations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=61.28s)]
*  But one thing you have to say is it's revolutionary. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  It's a bomb, it's not incremental change. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=65.16s)]
*  It's not like we're gonna use competency on the fine margins [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=66.84s)]
*  to make sure that we get this country back on track. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=70.3s)]
*  It's an understanding that Trump was never a threat [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=72.08s)]
*  to democracy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=75.0s)]
*  He was a threat, as Elon Musk says, to bureaucracy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  And I'm really excited about an outside government [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=80.32s)]
*  institution like Doge with Elon Musk, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=82.64s)]
*  and Vick Ramaswamy, and an army of revolutionaries [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=85.36s)]
*  improving, fixing, making this country great again. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=89.16s)]
*  Yeah, and they're gonna make it all public too. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=93.28s)]
*  I'm excited to see that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=94.52s)]
*  I wanna just see what is being wasted, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=95.48s)]
*  and hopefully they can prevent that from happening [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=98.16s)]
*  so that our dollar goes farther. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=100.88s)]
*  Tyson and Paul, that big fight, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=103.18s)]
*  we've been anticipating that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=105.16s)]
*  It's finally here, it's happening tonight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=106.16s)]
*  Did you see yesterday when Tyson slapped Paul? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=108.64s)]
*  What do you think? I did. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=112.92s)]
*  Did he step on his foot? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if he stepped on his foot [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=118.16s)]
*  at the same time in a WWE style maneuver. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=119.48s)]
*  You know, I'm of a certain age, Ainsley, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  that the idea of fighting Mike Tyson is enough [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=127.28s)]
*  to absolutely paralyze you with fear. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=130.6s)]
*  And I've gotta give Jake Paul this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=135.04s)]
*  I don't know, Mike Tyson's 60, I get it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=136.56s)]
*  60 year old men can't fight men half their age. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=139.08s)]
*  But Jake Paul is getting in the ring [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=141.96s)]
*  with the idea of Mike Tyson, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  and I give Jake Paul a lot of credit. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=146.24s)]
*  I mean, I don't know many people, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=149.16s)]
*  now there's a lot of money on the line [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=150.84s)]
*  of why he's doing it, but my good Lord, Jake, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=152.24s)]
*  God bless you, good luck. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=154.28s)]
*  He may win, because Tyson's still 60, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=156.52s)]
*  but on the other hand, he's also Mike Tyson. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a 31 year age difference. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so Pete was nominated for Secretary of Defense. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=163.4s)]
*  We are all excited for him, because we love him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=166.8s)]
*  He's part of our family, but you worked with him, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=168.96s)]
*  you worked with him for years on the Weekend Show. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=171.24s)]
*  What was your reaction of this? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=174.28s)]
*  Ainsley, what are you doing? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=177.44s)]
*  You know, there used to be a show. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you ever see Jerry Maguire? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Do you ever see that Ainsley, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=183.52s)]
*  the movie Jerry Maguire, you remember that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=184.44s)]
*  Yeah. Remember they did that scene, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=185.96s)]
*  they had the guy, there used to be a show on ESPN [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=187.24s)]
*  called Roy, with Roy Firestone. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=189.28s)]
*  He'd get all the athletes to come in, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=190.84s)]
*  and the thing was Roy would make the athlete cry, you know? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=192.44s)]
*  And then in Jerry Maguire, the scene was, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  you're not gonna make me cry, Roy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=197.96s)]
*  You're not gonna make me cry. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=199.24s)]
*  You're not gonna make me cry, Ainsley. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=200.6s)]
*  You're not gonna make me cry on TV. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=202.0s)]
*  I'm not gonna do that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQjWZFKnkc&t=203.35999999999999s)]
