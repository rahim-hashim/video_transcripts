# Dave Ramsey: This is mind-blowing
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE)
*  Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to make a third consecutive cut of interest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=0.0s)]
*  rates later on today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  While inflation has ticked down, it's still a percentage higher since President Biden [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=7.48s)]
*  came into office, as you can see right there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=13.36s)]
*  Here to discuss is personal finance expert Dave Ramsey. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=15.4s)]
*  Dave, good morning to you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=18.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=20.84s)]
*  Merry Christmas, Steve. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=21.84s)]
*  Merry Christmas to you as well. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=22.84s)]
*  We're going to talk about Christmas gifts and stuff like that in a minute, but you know, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=23.84s)]
*  It will kind of be a little Christmas gift from the Fed if they do cut interest rates. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=27.38s)]
*  But when you look at the numbers over the last year or so, actually during Joe Biden's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=32.7s)]
*  term, the cost of pretty much everything is up at least 20%. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=42.5s)]
*  And so, you know, when you go up 20% and then you come down, you're still higher. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  That's the way the math works on this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=52.42s)]
*  So even though we're only up 2% right now in the inflation rate, it's a 2% over a bigger [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=53.78s)]
*  number than we had before. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  So it's a problem. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=61.42s)]
*  But you know, good news is people are starting to adjust. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=63.04s)]
*  We seem to be heading in the right direction. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=65.42s)]
*  The sun will come out tomorrow. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=67.5s)]
*  It looks like Q1, Q2 next year are going to be a wonderful time in the economy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  Well during the first quarter and the second quarter, people in the United States will [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=73.5s)]
*  still be paying off the amounts of money that they are spending right now for Christmas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=77.98s)]
*  And in fact, the average American is going to spend over $2,000 this Christmas season [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=83.1s)]
*  on all this stuff. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=87.7s)]
*  And the parents are expected to spend $461 per child. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=89.34s)]
*  And here's the thing, Dave, when you look at that number right here, there are still [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=96.06s)]
*  a lot of Americans who are still paying off what they spent last Christmas today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=100.7s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=107.42s)]
*  Yeah, the average over the last several years has been that people pay their credit card [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=108.9s)]
*  debt from Christmas into May. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=112.94s)]
*  So it takes them about half the year to come back because they don't plan for Christmas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=114.98s)]
*  Like it sneaks up on them, like they move it or something. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=120.54s)]
*  It's always in December. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=122.78s)]
*  So let's lay out a plan here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=123.78s)]
*  And the old Christmas club from the 1950s or 60s could come back, meaning you save money [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  every month to get ready for the coming Christmas, not pay in arrears for the last two Christmases. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=131.78s)]
*  Which is where we are now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=139.26s)]
*  But those numbers are mind-blowing when you look at the averages there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=140.26s)]
*  That's a lot of money going out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  And all in the name of happiness comes from stuff, and it doesn't. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=146.5s)]
*  From stuff. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=151.86s)]
*  Your daughter Rachel was with us a couple of days ago, and she had a tip for people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=152.86s)]
*  Rather than go into a store and just spend willy-nilly, in your mind, or at least on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=158.66s)]
*  a piece of paper, make a list of how much you're going to spend on each person. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=163.34s)]
*  Like, okay, Ainsley Earhart, I'm going to be spending $75 on Ainsley. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=167.34s)]
*  Lawrence Jones, I'm going to be spending $125 on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=172.86s)]
*  You need to have numbers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=176.86s)]
*  You know, I'm old and I met a guy from the North Pole. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=181.74s)]
*  He said make a list and check it twice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=184.46s)]
*  So Rachel's right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=187.06s)]
*  And if you do that, you put a name beside it, and then you total up those dollar amounts, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=189.46s)]
*  you have what's called a Christmas budget. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=193.34s)]
*  And then if you stick to that, you won't overspend. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=195.3s)]
*  The problem with Christmas is not that we enjoy buying gifts for someone else. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  That's a wonderful thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=201.66000000000003s)]
*  The problem is we impulse our butts off, and we double up what we spend, because the retailers [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  make all their money during this season. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=208.74s)]
*  And so they're great merchandisers. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=211.08s)]
*  They're great at putting stuff in front of us that we hadn't planned to buy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=213.3s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=216.78s)]
*  You know, Dave, it's striking me looking at you right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=217.78s)]
*  If you had a red hat on that had a little fuzz on it, you might look like somebody who's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=220.22s)]
*  going to be very busy next week. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-rT1EgwBE&t=225.98s)]
