# Brian Kilmeade: How hard would this have been?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g)
*  Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Roe owning up to some of the agency failures including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=0.0s)]
*  a lack of communication and drone issues that led to the first assassination attempt on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=7.58s)]
*  President Trump, the first. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=13.06s)]
*  It comes as a new Secret Service report reveals that local police responsible for the roof [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=15.32s)]
*  where the shooter was found had never spoken to the Secret Service prior to the attempt [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=18.96s)]
*  on Trump's life. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=24.02s)]
*  Joining us now with more is Fox & Friends co-host and host of One Nation, Brian Kilmeade. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=26.54s)]
*  Brian, great to see you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=31.38s)]
*  What do you make of this quasi-mea culpa and what's been revealed around the investigation? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=33.66s)]
*  I mean, Ronald Roe has an opportunity to say, listen, I wasn't in charge, this is what I [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=39.7s)]
*  found, let's work on this together. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And I appreciate the fact that he's coming out and he's addressing us because you know [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=46.82s)]
*  who didn't? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  He acted the director that was responsible, Kimberly Cheadle, who looks as though looking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=51.9s)]
*  at her resume she had no business running the Secret Service, who came out arrogantly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=56.78s)]
*  and just smugly sat there and said after her testimony, which was such a train wreck, she [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=61.0s)]
*  resigned. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=67.22s)]
*  But to me he comes off defensive. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=68.3s)]
*  We know these people are great. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=70.58s)]
*  I have a lot of trouble, as do you, being critical of law enforcement. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=71.94s)]
*  People that throw themselves in front of bullets should be lauded, not criticized. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=76.08s)]
*  And I worry that they're watching me and you and saying, I work 18 hours a day, I haven't [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=81.42s)]
*  seen my family in three months, and now these guys are going to be critical of me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=85.9s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=89.86s)]
*  But the systems are broken. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=90.86s)]
*  I can't believe how bad this was. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=92.7s)]
*  Do you know one of the highlights for me was instead of using their radios to say we're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=95.18s)]
*  looking for a would-be gunman, they can't find him, they're texting. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=100.6s)]
*  I mean, how hard would it be to use your radio which would have alerted everybody? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=105.1s)]
*  How hard would it have been to put local police in a meeting with the Secret Service [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=109.3s)]
*  in order to coordinate an event? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  And Pete, I thought about this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=114.8s)]
*  How many other events, mostly probably Trump because he does most of them, were barely [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  protected? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=121.7s)]
*  How many other events where a handful of cops with no coordination with the Secret Service? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=122.7s)]
*  If you really cared, you'd go back, not just to Butler, to others and say what was the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=127.66s)]
*  deal? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=132.54s)]
*  And then I like to get Secret Service involved. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=133.54s)]
*  I hear one of the requirements for to be Secret Service is college. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=135.54s)]
*  If you are a special operator and you come out at 32 years old and you want to retire [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=140.94s)]
*  and do something productive, maybe you want to go to the Secret Service or any of your [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=145.7s)]
*  bachelor's degree. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=148.82s)]
*  Can we waive that and get some of the best trained people in our country around the most [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=149.82s)]
*  important people in our country? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=154.62s)]
*  Especially when they have a shortage of counter snipers and specialties that easily could [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  be filled by experts from the military. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=160.14s)]
*  Well, you had a chance to talk to... [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=163.7s)]
*  Oh, go ahead, Brian. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to say, and the other one, I do not understand how they consider the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=166.0s)]
*  golf thing, assassination number two, a success. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  You got to have somebody walk in the perimeter, say, I love what my agent did, spotting the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=175.38s)]
*  barrel of the gun, but I'm disappointed we didn't have someone on the other side of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=179.89999999999998s)]
*  fence. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  Don't just say we did enough because logic gets in here and you say, what else are you [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=184.89999999999998s)]
*  not being candid about? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=189.38s)]
*  But I asked President Trump this, Pete. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=190.86s)]
*  I said, I know you feel protected. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=192.46s)]
*  You've already said that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  But what about your family? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=195.46s)]
*  And this is what he said. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  I know you and your safety and the special secret service, but do you worry about your [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=199.5s)]
*  family too? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't talk about it, but I do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  I have to worry about family. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=208.18s)]
*  I have to worry about everybody. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  I worry about you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  I worry about everybody because, look, we're under siege and no country has ever suffered [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  like we have for the last three and a half, almost four years, when they allow millions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=217.78s)]
*  of people to come into our country from prisons, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=222.18s)]
*  From prisons and terrorists and people from mental institutions, and they take over our [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=226.46s)]
*  parks. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=231.3s)]
*  Look at New York. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=232.3s)]
*  They can't play Little League Baseball anymore. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=233.3s)]
*  You know, that doesn't sound serious, but it is serious. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=234.3s)]
*  When they take away your whole lifestyle, when they live in hotels better than our incredible [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=237.46s)]
*  veterans who are lying on the street opposite the main entrance to a hotel, and in that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  hotel you have illegal aliens that have come in, and by the way, destroying the hotel, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=247.5s)]
*  fighting at levels that the police don't even want to go into the hotels. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=252.9s)]
*  When you have that happening at this city and this country, I do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=256.5s)]
*  I want to protect everybody. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=260.34s)]
*  You know, P.D., he has meetings during the day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=262.86s)]
*  Then he goes to the cryptocurrency, first purchase ever by a former president, buys [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=267.26s)]
*  a bunch of hamburgers, does Gutfeld, which took an hour and a half, and then he gets [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=272.5s)]
*  on a caravan, goes to Long Island, has to take pictures with 300 VIPs all paid for it, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=276.5s)]
*  does 10 minutes with me, which you know is taxing and exhausting, and then he does a [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=282.54s)]
*  two hour live event in front of 18,000 people with maybe 6,000 on the outside, and then [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=286.94s)]
*  who knows what he did on the way back in New York. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=294.02s)]
*  He didn't worry about his son at a local college here in New York City. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=296.62s)]
*  I mean, that's tough for a 28-year-old. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=300.34s)]
*  What about a 78-year-old? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=303.34s)]
*  But he thinks he can do this, and we're going to find out in the next 45 days if he can. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=305.22s)]
*  Sure will. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  I wonder who has more energy, Donald Trump or Brian Kilmeade? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  That is an open question. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=315.82000000000005s)]
*  We will debate it on the couch. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  It's a toss-up. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=318.1s)]
*  It's a toss-up. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=319.1s)]
*  But Pete, I'll tell you, I have a chance to talk to you tonight at 9 o'clock. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=320.1s)]
*  You have done something for me that I just can't thank you enough. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=326.42s)]
*  You watched thousands of hours of video and pulled out the media moments of the week, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=329.6s)]
*  and I can't wait to see what you have. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=333.54s)]
*  Robert Davie overdressed, but he's going to be great talking about celebrities and singing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=335.06s)]
*  Should they be weighing in on what you guys were just talking about when it comes to these [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=339.5s)]
*  elections? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  And ask Asa Raskin and Tristan Harris. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  Asa invented the scrolling mechanism on your phone that lets you go through Instagram and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  all your things. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=354.46s)]
*  He feels guilty. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  It formed an addiction in this country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  Is AI a friend or foe? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=358.85999999999996s)]
*  Both of them, break it down for us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=360.29999999999995s)]
*  We've seen the entire interview with Donald Trump on One Nation tonight. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=362.1s)]
*  Do not miss it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  Brian? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTs6c8_oR7g&t=366.78000000000003s)]
