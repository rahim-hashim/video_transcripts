# Katie Pavlich: 'Everyone should be afraid'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI)
*  So a Fox News alert, eight people are injured after a man yelling, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=0.0s)]
*  free Palestine, attacked a rally for Israeli hostages with a makeshift flame blower. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=4.16s)]
*  The suspect, an Egyptian national who was in the U.S. illegally after overseeing his visa, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  has been charged with at least eight felony charges, including first degree murder, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=16.48s)]
*  although police have not yet confirmed that anyone was killed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=20.8s)]
*  Fox News contributor Katie Pavlis joins us now with a reaction. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=25.36s)]
*  Katie, a line needs to be drawn, right? The Jews are afraid, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  and the criminals seem to be empowered on the streets today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Everyone should be afraid. This is a case of American citizens in a United States city [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=39.92s)]
*  being firebombed by an illegal alien from Egypt who has Islamic terrorism ties and ideology. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=46.64s)]
*  Exercising their First Amendment rights, Al Fawwack saying, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=54.96s)]
*  we don't think that innocent people should be taken hostage and they should be released [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=57.68s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip. And this is what we've seen over the course of the past couple of months. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=61.68s)]
*  We've seen attack after attack after attack. And what is this fueled by? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=66.64s)]
*  First, it's fueled by an American media which has been lying and spreading falsehoods about [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Israel's defensive war against this death cult in Gaza and elsewhere in the Middle East. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=76.0s)]
*  And also it's fueled by Democrats like the Biden administration who want to let in people who are [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=82.4s)]
*  anti-American, who don't share our values and who think the way to settle scores with people you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=88.64s)]
*  disagree with is to try and murder them. And that's what we saw yesterday. That's what we saw [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., the capital city, where two staffers from the Israeli embassy, one a Christian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=99.2s)]
*  from Germany and an American citizen were gunned down in the streets by someone who thinks that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=105.12s)]
*  this free Palestine ideology is something that they're willing to take people's lives over. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=111.76s)]
*  This is anti-American. It has to stop. And it vindicates the Trump administration when they say, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=117.36s)]
*  we're stripping visas from people who engage in this kind of ideology, who think that this is the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  way that you settle scores in this country. That's not what we do here. And they're trying to get [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=127.92s)]
*  them out. And you saw Stephen Miller, who of course is the deputy chief of staff, a presidential [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=132.4s)]
*  adviser yesterday saying the suicidal importing of this kind of ideology is going to stop. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=137.28s)]
*  Katie, I feel like we're missing the big picture, though, as an American people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=146.48s)]
*  And you're right. It's not just the Jews that are being targeted. It's Americans as well. The [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=150.88s)]
*  ideology that they proclaim is not compatible with our American Judeo-Christian values here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=155.68s)]
*  You can be a peaceful Muslim, but you cannot be an Islamist. You can't call for an antifada. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=162.8s)]
*  And people think they're just chants. They're not just chanting. They have meaning behind them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Why is that important for people to understand? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=172.72s)]
*  Well, I'm not really sure where people expect this movement to go, given where it's been over [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=177.68s)]
*  the course of the past two years almost, year and a half after the October 7th attacks, when [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=182.96s)]
*  Americans were murdered, where Americans were held hostage, where this ideology has spread [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=188.96s)]
*  on college campuses in the United States of America, this type of terrorism justified [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  by the elites in this country, the mealy-mouthed response of the previous administration to this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=199.52s)]
*  type of ideology which is now playing out in the taking of lives and the attempted murder [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=205.52s)]
*  of American cities across the United States. This is something that could have been prevented [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=211.44s)]
*  if it had been condemned, but in lots of different circles, it is something that is not only not [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=218.8s)]
*  condemned, but that is celebrated as a reason to push back against some kind of defensive action [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  against terrorism, not just in the Gaza Strip, but also in the United States of America. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=230.96s)]
*  And so the bigger picture is, if you don't think they're coming for you and that this doesn't go [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=237.36s)]
*  somewhere else, you're wrong. I fear it's going to get worse before it gets better. Globalizing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=241.84s)]
*  the intifada means killing people wherever they are. And we saw that in the intifada, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=246.96s)]
*  and we've been warning about this for months when we hear these chants on college campuses. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  I've been to a number of these pro-terrorism, pro-Hamas protests, rallies, riots. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=256.0s)]
*  In Washington, D.C., last summer, they tore down all of the American flags at Union Station [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=262.32s)]
*  across from the United States Capitol, burned them, and hoisted up the same flag that Hamas flies. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=269.36s)]
*  If you're not paying attention, you better pay attention now, because it could get worse if [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=275.84s)]
*  people aren't willing to stand up and call it for what it is. And it's terrorism, and it's not [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  welcome here in the United States of America. You're right, Katie. It is going to get worse. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=284.08s)]
*  It's not if. It is, because they're already here. We allowed them to come. So now we've got to deal [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  with the consequences. Thank God we've got an administration that's ready to have some type of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=291.84s)]
*  defensive posture. We're trying to get them out. Thanks, Katie. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McvDcrzANnI&t=295.84s)]
