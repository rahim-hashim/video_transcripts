# 'Once-in-a-lifetime': Highlights from Trump's historic Madison Square Garden rally
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0)
*  All right, on this Monday morning, let's talk about what happened last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm sure you saw it live right here on Fox News Channel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=6.8s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump made one last pitch to voters in the world's most famous [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=9.78s)]
*  arena yesterday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  So who was there? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=15.66s)]
*  Huck Hogan, Dana White, and Elon Musk all sharing their support for Trump before the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=16.66s)]
*  pact. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=20.46s)]
*  Madison Square Garden crowd got a surprise appearance from former first lady Melania Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=21.46s)]
*  I envision a wonderful America where the seeds of security, prosperity, and health are sown [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=28.56s)]
*  once again for the benefit of our families. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=37.16s)]
*  Let us charge together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=45.2s)]
*  Let's size this moment and create a country for tomorrow, the future that we deserve. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=53.64s)]
*  And now, please welcome our next Commander in Chief, my husband, President Donald J. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=66.48s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=80.96s)]
*  And the former president sharing a message of hope with that massive crowd. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=97.08s)]
*  I'm asking you to dream big again. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  We're going to dream big again. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=109.32s)]
*  We haven't been dreaming big at all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=110.52s)]
*  This will be America's new golden age. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  It's going to happen quickly too, very quickly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=119.52s)]
*  Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Next Tuesday you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've done [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=132.1s)]
*  a terrible job. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=139.62s)]
*  That crooked Joe Biden has done a terrible job. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  You've destroyed our country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=147.74s)]
*  We're not going to take it anymore. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  Kamala, you're fired. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=153.54s)]
*  Get out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=156.1s)]
*  Get out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=157.1s)]
*  You're fired. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=158.1s)]
*  On issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=160.9s)]
*  We're going to fix it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  But we're just not running against Kamala. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=171.06s)]
*  I think a lot of our politicians here tonight know this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=174.42s)]
*  She means nothing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=178.18s)]
*  She's purely a vessel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=180.14s)]
*  To save our country, for the past nine years we have been fighting against the most sinister [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=181.14s)]
*  and corrupt forces on earth. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=186.98s)]
*  With your vote in this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=189.62s)]
*  not belong to them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=193.88s)]
*  This nation belongs to you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=196.02s)]
*  It belongs to you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=198.78s)]
*  No city embodies the spirit, energy, and potential of the American people more than where we [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=201.58s)]
*  are gathered tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=209.12s)]
*  We want to win our country, but we also want to win New York and make it safe and strong [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=211.34s)]
*  and beautiful and affordable and vibrant again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=217.82000000000002s)]
*  And we're going to do that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=221.18s)]
*  You know, you saw it all here yesterday on the Fox News Channel, and he opened his address, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=224.1s)]
*  his 78-minute address, with something that we had suggested that every candidate should [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=231.98s)]
*  do, making their closing argument, and he became another one who did it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=238.02s)]
*  But it was very effective because it really harkens to how Americans are feeling. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=242.18s)]
*  And he said, essentially, are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=246.38s)]
*  And that's the decision everybody's got to make as you see him walk in with a very rare [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=251.22s)]
*  Lee Greenwood actually singing the song live, God bless the USA, just off on the side of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  the stage. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=263.41999999999996s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  That was his opening pitch. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  Are you better off today or four years ago? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  And the crowd went cra- Look at that, y'all. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  It was packed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=271.82s)]
*  I think the most spectacular thing that he did, though, even though you have this massive [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=272.82s)]
*  crowd in front of you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=277.34s)]
*  If you talk with people that are in the conservative movement, they feel really good about the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=280.18s)]
*  chances of the former president winning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  They think they are ahead. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=285.38000000000005s)]
*  But he made it very clear that the people still need to go out there and vote. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=286.66s)]
*  Every vote counts. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=290.3s)]
*  And he did that poll of who's already voted, who is going to vote. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=291.3s)]
*  And I think that's important right now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=295.18s)]
*  I think that in talking to some people higher up with the campaign, they said, what's the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=296.5s)]
*  focus? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  And they said, it's in New York. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  It's at the world's most famous arena, but it's in the country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  If they had their druthers, they would have had a little bit closer to Election Day, but [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=306.22s)]
*  Madison Square Garden has only so many vacancies. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=309.3s)]
*  They do, the Knicks and Rangers do hope to play there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=311.82s)]
*  So I think that's it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=315.46s)]
*  And the whole thing is- Did he try to get the rally closer to the election? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=316.46s)]
*  That was the hope, to get a little bit closer, but it's still pretty cool on Sunday right [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  before. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  But the beginning of the closing is today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=323.97999999999996s)]
*  But it is the speech that they've wanted to outline the problem, but talk optimistically [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=326.97999999999996s)]
*  about I can fix it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=331.46s)]
*  So okay, you're going to watch, in the perfect world, everything get a little bit more optimistic [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=332.86s)]
*  all throughout the week. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=338.5s)]
*  So and that's just it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=340.1s)]
*  And to put together that roster of people, I want you to take a listen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=341.7s)]
*  If you had a chance, you know, if Sunday night didn't work for you to be able to watch this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=345.5s)]
*  year, just know this, 20,000 plus inside, probably another 10,000 outside. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=349.22s)]
*  And think about this, in 2016, it was known like the protests. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  Trump wins protests on the outside. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=359.06s)]
*  Trump comes here, there's protests outside Trump Tower. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=361.38s)]
*  There were no protesters yesterday. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  Look at this, outside. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=365.94s)]
*  People were at all the bars and the restaurants celebrating and watching it online, too, or [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=367.26s)]
*  watching it on TV. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=371.34s)]
*  I think those are folks who are lined up to go inside. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=372.46s)]
*  But there are thousands on the outside. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=375.26s)]
*  There were a lot that couldn't make it in. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=376.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  So take a listen to some of the moments that stood out last night. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=379.22s)]
*  But today, Trump-a-maniacs, the energy in here is something like I've never felt. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=383.46s)]
*  The energy of all these Trump-a-maniacs is the most powerful force in the universe. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=390.82s)]
*  And today, this is Donald Trump's house, brother. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  He's proven to be the strong leader allies and adversaries alike must respect. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=402.38s)]
*  He's proven he loves this country so much, he's literally put his life on the line for it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=410.78s)]
*  As you can see. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=416.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm not just MAGA. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=420.78s)]
*  I'm Dogg Gothic MAGA. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=424.78s)]
*  Well, it's... the energy in this room is incredible. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=428.78s)]
*  What a great group of people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=440.78s)]
*  Your money is being wasted and the Department of Government Division C is going to fix that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=442.78s)]
*  We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=451.78s)]
*  Our hometown, where architectural symbols of strength, courage and unity create a canvas [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=456.78s)]
*  for the world's undisputed capital of industry. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=465.78s)]
*  Where tidings of finance, fashion and entertainment convene among an iconic range of superior design, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=471.78s)]
*  structures and artistic accomplishments. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=483.78s)]
*  And American individuality blossoms among determined citizens who raise across city streets [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=487.78s)]
*  and between offices striving for success. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=502.78s)]
*  It is you who are the heartbeat of this great metropolis. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=507.78s)]
*  So when I'm walking around the city, typically if someone supports the former president or supporter, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=514.78s)]
*  you'll get in New York City a nice little thumbs up, people very quiet about it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=521.78s)]
*  Hey, whisper. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=526.78s)]
*  I watched the speech from the area, sir, but I landed and by the time I got back to my building, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=527.78s)]
*  the lobby was full with red hats. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=532.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=534.78s)]
*  I had no idea that some of my neighbors supported the former president. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=536.78s)]
*  They had gone to the rally? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=541.78s)]
*  They had gone to the rally. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=542.78s)]
*  It's something that you typically don't see in New York City. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=543.78s)]
*  And the sea of red hats in my lobby, it just really shocked me. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=547.78s)]
*  But this was an opportunity for a once in a life opportunity. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=551.78s)]
*  A Republican came to New York City and all those Republicans in the city showed up. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=554.78s)]
*  That's right. At MSG, normally known as Madison Square Garden yesterday. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=558.78s)]
*  You can see the New York Post cover is MAGA Square Garden. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=563.78s)]
*  The guest roster and we featured that for you right there showing a lot of the stars, including Elon Musk. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=567.78s)]
*  It puts people into space when they were chanting his name. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=574.78s)]
*  He looked moved. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=578.78s)]
*  It felt a lot like the RNC reunion. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=579.78s)]
*  You saw a lot of people you saw at the RNC right there. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=583.78s)]
*  Of all the comments, however, of the warm up acts, there was a comic who made some offensive comments [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=587.78s)]
*  about Latinos and Puerto Ricans and African-Americans and others. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=594.78s)]
*  And he's already been denounced by Republicans and by the campaign. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=598.78s)]
*  But unfortunately for the Trump campaign, the Harris campaign has denounced it and mobilized influential Puerto Rican influencers like Bad Bunny, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=604.78s)]
*  who's very big in the Puerto Rican community, in the Latino community. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=614.78s)]
*  He put out something on Instagram. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=618.78s)]
*  And so did Ricky Martin with millions of followers. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=620.78s)]
*  And he wrote or he said, This is what they think of us vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=623.78s)]
*  A Trump adviser said the speaker's remarks were not vetted. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=629.78s)]
*  We're going to talk to Caroline Levitt. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=632.78s)]
*  It's going to be with us in a moment. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=635.78s)]
*  That was part of the pre-show. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=636.78s)]
*  That was part of the pre-show. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=637.78s)]
*  That was two hours before the president. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=638.78s)]
*  The warm up. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=639.78s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=640.78s)]
*  The cover of the New York Times. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=641.78s)]
*  Trump at Garden, a closing carnival of grievances, misogyny and racism. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=644.78s)]
*  Only somebody who works for the Harris campaign and pretending to be a reporter for the New York Times would write something like that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=649.78s)]
*  If you watched that three hours or four hours, you had to flip around to get it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=656.78s)]
*  We didn't take all of it live. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=660.78s)]
*  But did you also you don't point out that RFK, the most famous Democratic family, actually was one of the featured speakers around the most famous inventor in the world. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=662.78s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=673.78s)]
*  That stands out. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=674.78s)]
*  No, a comedian with a successful podcast. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=675.78s)]
*  But you lose goodwill when before the rally even started, they called it a Nazi rally before they even took the stage. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=678.78s)]
*  They had already said that it was going to be a racist rally. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=686.78s)]
*  Number two, maybe it's just me. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=689.78s)]
*  I have a dark sense of humor, you know, and so I like maybe this was not the appropriate format for the comedian be there. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=691.78s)]
*  But it's comedy. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=698.78s)]
*  Look, I mean, they're focused. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=700.78s)]
*  You all watch the interview with Jake Tapper and JD Vance over the weekend. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=701.78s)]
*  They're focusing on the wrong things. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=705.78s)]
*  I mean, look at that crowd. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=706.78s)]
*  Twenty it seats twenty thousand people, nineteen thousand sold out, people out on the street. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=707.78s)]
*  And I was reading it was tens of thousands of people that were outside outside. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=712.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=716.78s)]
*  Mike Johnson was there. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=717.78s)]
*  The speaker of the House, Vivek was there. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=718.78s)]
*  Tulsi spoke. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=720.78s)]
*  RFK Junior, Hulk Hogan, Dr. Phil, Dana White, JD Vance, Elon Musk, Melania Lee Greenwood was on stage with him singing, as you all mentioned. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=721.78s)]
*  And he and Melania went over and thanked him. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=730.78s)]
*  Did you say Melania? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=732.78s)]
*  I did. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=733.78s)]
*  I wonder when it'd be great tomorrow. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=734.78s)]
*  We're having a live show in this room. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=736.78s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=738.78s)]
*  She's going to be here live. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=739.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=740.78s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=741.78s)]
*  We carry Tucker Carlson was also great. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=742.78s)]
*  He said, I cannot believe I'm sandwiched in between RFK and Elon Musk. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=744.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=749.78s)]
*  Well, you know, and so you were talking a little bit about and Brian about the messaging from the other side, how the Republicans, rather the Democrats are trying to portray Donald Trump as fascist. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=750.78s)]
*  They will not lay off that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=762.78s)]
*  Well, particularly the fascist stuff, which comes from John Kelly and some other people talking about when he was president. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=764.78s)]
*  One of Kamala Harris's biggest super PACs, it's called Future Forward. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=769.78s)]
*  They warned Democrats that attacking Trump as a fascist is less effective in the final eight days than if you actually highlight her proposals and how they would help. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=774.78s)]
*  So in other words, stop with the attacks. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=788.78s)]
*  Talk about how she will change America's life. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=790.78s)]
*  Well, because it's baked in. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=792.78s)]
*  I mean, they've been doing this for 10 years against the guy, the American people that feel that way about him. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=794.78s)]
*  They've already made their decision. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=799.78s)]
*  But don't kid yourself. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=801.78s)]
*  If a Democrat would have went to a Republican stronghold and packed a house like last night, the coverage would have been much different. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=803.78s)]
*  If Kamala Harris would have been in a Republican Tulsa and had a stadium full of supporters there, the coverage would be, do you see the momentum here? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=812.78s)]
*  Well, she was in Texas last week with Beyonce. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=822.78s)]
*  Well, she was in Houston, Texas, which is a Democrat stronghold. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=824.78s)]
*  So it's not really different. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=827.78s)]
*  Pick a conservative, leany stronghold and then we'll see the coverage. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=830.78s)]
*  By the way, isn't it interesting, Beyonce didn't sing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=836.78s)]
*  Evidently, people were upset by that. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=839.78s)]
*  People were. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=841.78s)]
*  They thought they were going to get a free performance. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=842.78s)]
*  I mean, everybody else sang. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=843.78s)]
*  And the other one was Amber Rose said, Beyonce stole her speech. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=844.78s)]
*  Amber Rose is the star of the RNC that seemed to cross party lines because basically she stole the text of my speech. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=848.78s)]
*  You know, I remember when President Bush was out, did his second term, lame duck, done. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=855.78s)]
*  John McCain knew that at that point, President Bush, 43, he's much more popular now, was not popular. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=862.78s)]
*  So big deal. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=868.78s)]
*  Bush said, hey, listen, I'm not helping you. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=869.78s)]
*  Go do your own thing. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=871.78s)]
*  Don't even refer to me. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=872.78s)]
*  But evidently, Joe Biden is such a poor loser and can't figure out why he's not out there. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=873.78s)]
*  No one explained to him how much he's slipping and what a terrible president he's been. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=879.78s)]
*  Look what Axios' headlines are. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=883.78s)]
*  I mean, look right now. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=885.78s)]
*  They say that Biden has not been asked, much to his sergrine, to do anything. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=886.78s)]
*  Harris stiff arms gives the heisman basically to Biden. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=891.78s)]
*  And Axios is reporting that the Harris campaign keeps saying to his team, we'll get back to you. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=896.78s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=902.78s)]
*  We'll let you know. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=903.78s)]
*  Sometime in December. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=904.78s)]
*  He should have been in Pittsburgh and just did an event. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=905.78s)]
*  And he just screams out what a loser Donald Trump is. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=907.78s)]
*  That's not helpful. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=910.78s)]
*  They have Obama out there, but not the current president. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=911.78s)]
*  Well, they have everybody out there for her. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=914.78s)]
*  And I think there's a difference. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=916.78s)]
*  When people came to Houston, Texas, they came to see Beyonce. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=918.78s)]
*  When people came to MGM last night, they came to see Donald Trump. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=922.78s)]
*  And I think that's the difference. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=926.78s)]
*  You have a candidate that is at such a deficit when it comes to popularity that they're needing every single celebrity to galvanize support for her. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=927.78s)]
*  You don't see the same thing on the other side. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=937.78s)]
*  Well, the reason that Joe Biden is being snubbed, the number 39, that is his approval rating right now. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=939.78s)]
*  If it was in the 40s or 50s, maybe, but 30s? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=946.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=948.78s)]
*  I mean, grow up. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=949.78s)]
*  It doesn't understand politics. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6-LktjX_z0&t=950.78s)]
