# The Democrats never expected this: Lawrence Jones
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek)
*  Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal, Jerry Baker, our friend who works upstairs here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=0.0s)]
*  he has written a thought-provoking column. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=3.88s)]
*  It's titled, Barack Obama and the Democrats' Politics of Contempt. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=6.44s)]
*  And essentially what it says is if you're thinking about how the mainstream media essentially [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=10.28s)]
*  is saying, hey, if you're thinking about voting for Donald Trump, it's either because you're [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=16.48s)]
*  bad or because you're stupid. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=21.46s)]
*  It's contemptible. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  So this is what a portion of the article says. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=26.16s)]
*  Is it impossible, for example, that black men may think Mr. Trump would do a better [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=29.52s)]
*  job for the economy than another Democratic administration? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=35.04s)]
*  Or that the Democrats' denial that sex is a biological reality is a serious threat to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=38.28s)]
*  both the nation's values and science? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Or that Hispanics might want a candidate who has a record and a promise of imposing a tough [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=46.46s)]
*  immigration policy that will keep the country safer? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=51.72s)]
*  The Democratic self-ordained mission to make better humans of us all is not only tiresomely [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=54.82s)]
*  elitist, it's also of dubious political value. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=61.1s)]
*  If you have such a low opinion of voters, they may end up having a low opinion of you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=65.5s)]
*  So one thing that I've discovered from the Democrats about doing these barbershops and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=72.06s)]
*  talking with voters of different parties, but of course in the barbershop you got some [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=76.02s)]
*  Trump voters as well, which it's new because there's never been a Republican on the ticket [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=82.3s)]
*  in modern day time to get so much support from black men. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  And one thing that I discovered from the Harris voters that still remain with black males, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=92.46s)]
*  they never expected that when they changed the ticket, because Joe Biden was doing bad [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  with black males as well compared to other Democrats, but they thought by having a black [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=103.7s)]
*  on the ticket that it would pressure some black males to vote based on that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=109.06s)]
*  And the black males have completely rejected that policy position. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=115.06s)]
*  They haven't seen anything from Kamala Harris that inspires them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=120.18s)]
*  They don't trust her. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=123.2s)]
*  And the second issue is she hasn't given an answer of substance on why she hasn't put [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=124.78s)]
*  policies in right now to fix the economy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=130.46s)]
*  And whether you love or hate Donald Trump, a lot of black voters, specifically black [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=134.66s)]
*  males, feel like the economy was better under him, and they haven't provided a response [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=140.42s)]
*  to that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=144.06s)]
*  I think there's so much to this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=145.06s)]
*  Number one, I think that fundamentally Trump is the first to this, and I think in future [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=146.18s)]
*  cycles we'll be there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=150.5s)]
*  I think people are tired of being sexualized. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  This is for black men. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=154.9s)]
*  This is for black women. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=155.9s)]
*  This is for Hispanic men. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=156.9s)]
*  This is for Hispanic women. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=157.9s)]
*  This is for women. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=158.9s)]
*  This is for men. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=159.9s)]
*  I think most of all they're Americans. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=160.9s)]
*  They want an opportunity to be successful. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=162.36s)]
*  They want an opportunity to go to school. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=165.8s)]
*  They don't need to smoke pot for free. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=167.5s)]
*  They don't need special loans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=169.74s)]
*  They need an equal playing field. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  Make it equal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=173.82000000000002s)]
*  Don't tell me I need special services. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=175.28s)]
*  And please don't think I'm naive enough to know when you're pandering. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=179.0s)]
*  You have three weeks to get an election. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=182.44000000000003s)]
*  We all see the numbers, and you go give them loans, give them pot, give them special housing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  discounts, and they'll vote for me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=191.16s)]
*  They can see through it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=193.68s)]
*  That is how politics work for a long time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=194.96s)]
*  You can tell pandering from a program. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=199.04s)]
*  These are individual pandering for a program. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=202.14s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump has going for him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=204.56s)]
*  We saw what it was like under four years, under his administration. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=206.48s)]
*  We saw what it was like under Kamala Harris. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  He had to remain in Mexico. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=211.72s)]
*  If you sought asylum, if you're an illegal and you say I need to leave my country and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=212.98s)]
*  come to America, he said you have to wait in Mexico until you're hearing, and then [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=216.8s)]
*  we'll decide. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=220.36s)]
*  Then Kamala Harris and Joe Biden come in and they do away with remain in Mexico. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=221.36s)]
*  94 different border rules. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=225.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=227.56s)]
*  Most everybody can just walk across, declare asylum. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=228.56s)]
*  Once you're in, you're in. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  Once your feet hit American soil, you're in. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  You don't even have to show up for your hearing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=234.12s)]
*  You could be a criminal and you're in. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=236.74s)]
*  And we've seen that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  And then now they're trying to blame it on the border bill that Trump didn't sign. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=242.96s)]
*  That border bill came out this year. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=243.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris was in office three and a half years ago. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=244.96s)]
*  The problem with the pandering though, to Steve and Brian's point, is that the pandering [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=248.76s)]
*  misses the mark. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=254.28s)]
*  You want to put marijuana on the table, but people can't afford groceries. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  So, I mean, putting weed on the table. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Get high, you'll forget you're hungry. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=263.8s)]
*  Yeah, it just doesn't make sense. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=265.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=267.0s)]
*  Then she says that she's going to give loans to black businesses, but then you're going [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=268.0s)]
*  to put more taxes and more regulations on those same black businesses. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=272.0s)]
*  And increase corporate taxes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=275.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=276.92s)]
*  And the policies that she's throwing out there as red meat to try to attract us misses the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=277.92s)]
*  mark every single time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=282.92s)]
*  Here's the thing, and this goes to my point with Brian, and that is American politics. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=285.2s)]
*  It's how it's worked forever. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=288.8s)]
*  I remember when my kids were in grade school and when they were, you know, the kids who [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=290.68s)]
*  are running for class president, they would say, you know what? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=295.0s)]
*  We're going to get Harry Potter, JK Rowling to come to our school. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=298.12s)]
*  We're going to have candy every day at noon after lunch. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  Those kids always won. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=306.48s)]
*  JK Rowling never came to the school and they never got candy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=308.36s)]
*  But it's just one of those things people do in politics. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  Hey, I'll give you some free stuff. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=314.76s)]
*  I just hope I vote in demographic. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=316.6s)]
*  Don't behave like children. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=320.12s)]
*  And don't take the shiny objects. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=321.88s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=325.6s)]
*  I mean, by the way, why is it that black people like pot? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=326.6s)]
*  I mean, is that an insult? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=329.8s)]
*  I mean, what about the white people like Coors beer? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, what are you trying to do? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  I think I think there's a large demographic of Americans that are smoking weed today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=335.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't I don't think that's an agenda for black America. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=340.12s)]
*  I think that's agenda for a lot of people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  But the thing is, people can't afford basic items now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=345.04s)]
*  Being able to buy weed because it's illegal in a lot of states is a luxury right now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=348.6s)]
*  And I think it just misses the overall point of what Americans it is pandering. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  It's insulting in some ways to say that that is a black agenda. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=358.16s)]
*  That's why when the speaker of the House was interviewed over the weekend and they say, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=361.44000000000005s)]
*  don't we want to know the cholesterol of Donald Trump? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=365.36s)]
*  Because no one cares about it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=367.28s)]
*  Cholesterol. We care about being able to afford our groceries. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJr32z5UBek&t=370.0s)]
