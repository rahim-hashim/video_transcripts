# ‘FOLLOW THE MONEY': Iran never had the funds to attack until now
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ)
*  Let's bring in former deputy national security advisor, KT McFarland. She joins us now. KT, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  let me pick up right where we left off there, because you can understand why an IDF spokesman [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  would not necessarily preview what the response might be and that that becomes a strategic [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  political decision for the leadership of Israel. From where you sit, what do you think the Israeli [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=14.16s)]
*  response look like? And then, and likewise, if you're looking at it through the lens of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=20.32s)]
*  America first, what should our response be? Well, I think that to a certain extent, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=23.92s)]
*  President Biden has really limited Israel's responses because on one hand, the Iranians [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=29.28s)]
*  escalated this, right? It was a direct attack by Iran on Israel and all of the Iran proxies on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Israel. So a combined direct attack. But on the other hand, the United States and the United [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=41.44s)]
*  Kingdom and France and Jordan, they joined in the defense of Israel, which I wasn't really expecting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=46.8s)]
*  So President Biden leading that through the US Central Command, leading that response and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=52.0s)]
*  sort of deflecting and catching all the missiles before they hit Israel. So there were sort of two [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  major things going on. Israel's now in a position where Biden has basically said to them, don't [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=63.36s)]
*  escalate, don't respond. Iran has said, that's it for now. Don't worry about anything unless [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=69.12s)]
*  Israel does something else. So it's all kind of muddy. Now, in my 57 years in this line of work, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=74.64s)]
*  when stuff gets muddy and confusing, I think it's time to take a step back and look at the big [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  picture. The big picture is follow the money. Why was Iran able to do this in the first place? Why [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=84.48s)]
*  was he not able to do this in the Trump administration? Iran is rich right now. Thanks to Biden's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=91.12s)]
*  policies, not only freeing revenues to go to Iran and allowing Iran to sell oil on the international [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=97.2s)]
*  market, but basically Biden's energy policy has driven up the price of oil. Iran is rich. It can [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=103.68s)]
*  keep fighting for a long time. You know, it's so interesting how you lay that out because we've [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=109.36s)]
*  been talking about that all morning. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Iran is rich right now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=114.32s)]
*  So, I mean, this is the Biden administration. Is it that they care so much more about their climate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=121.36s)]
*  religion that they don't care how it destabilizes the Middle East and enriches, you know, Iran? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  Or is there something more intentional and nefarious going on? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=134.48s)]
*  You know, I would say it might be the latter, except if you look at the Biden administration's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=139.6s)]
*  sort of zealotry on the climate issue and in fact destroying the climate argument they make [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=143.92s)]
*  because what's the substitute for dirty oil and dirty coal? Clean American natural gas, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=150.48s)]
*  liquefied natural gas. And yet the Biden administration is standing in the way of that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=154.72s)]
*  So it's not just that Iran got rich. It's Russia got rich. You know, when Donald Trump comes out [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  and says, well, they would never have done that. Russia would never have done it. Iran never would [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  have done it when I was president. Well, that's actually quite true. Now, President Trump likes [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  to say it's because he was so tough. Well, that's part of it. But the big part of it is they didn't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=171.2s)]
*  have the money. You know, Iran would love to attack Israel, would love to destroy Israel. For 45 years [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  they've tried to do that. Russia would love to take over Ukraine. They've wanted to do it since [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  the end of the Cold War, but they never had the money until now. And it was directly as a result [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  of Biden's energy policies, in particular with the case of Iran, allowing Iran to sell oil. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Katie, as you point out, you have 57 years of experience. It is something we can't bring to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  bear on how this sort of works. But we're clearly on the ladder. We're on the escalation ladder. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=200.72s)]
*  It starts with October 7th. Israel's analysis, correctly, is that Iran is behind in helping fund [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=206.72s)]
*  what happens on October 7th. Israel climbs a rung of the ladder and takes out an Iranian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=212.96s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard general in Damascus. Iran climbs up another step of the ladder now and says, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=220.72s)]
*  okay, well, we're going to launch all these drone and missile attacks for the first time [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  directly from Iran onto Israel. What's the next step on the ladder? What happens next, Katie? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=230.56s)]
*  When Israel climbs the next rung, what does it look like? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=236.96s)]
*  Well, if Israel does climb the next rung, the question will be a couple things. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  Will the Biden administration support Israel? Will it stand on the sidelines? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=246.0s)]
*  God forbid would it support Iran. And then what would Iran do? Iran has a lot of missiles left [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=250.0s)]
*  and a lot of drones left that it could launch another attack. Unless you follow the money, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=254.88s)]
*  unless you deny Iran the financial ability to wage an expensive war, Iran is going to keep [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=259.84s)]
*  waging these wars. Iran has had the same goal since the Iranian Revolution in 1978, 1979. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=265.44s)]
*  Get the United States divided from Israel, drive a wedge between the U.S. and Israel, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=273.12s)]
*  and then once Israel is isolated, go in and finish the job. And that's where they think they are now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=277.68s)]
*  They think they have a wedge between the United States and Israel. And so President Biden is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=282.56s)]
*  thinking, well, if we step back from Israel a little bit, it's going to be great for us politically [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=286.8s)]
*  in Dearborn, Michigan. We're going to win Michigan. We're going to run re-election. But on the other [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=290.88s)]
*  hand, they're making a bigger war much more likely because if Israel looks alone, then Iran goes in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=294.64s)]
*  for the kill. They've made it really clear for 45 years that's what they want to do. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=299.92s)]
*  Katie, really quick before we go. So you talk about follow the money, but it's also follow [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=304.24s)]
*  the politics. So you alluded now to the domestic politics that are influencing this [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=308.24s)]
*  on Biden's side. But what about the domestic politics in Israel? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=314.64s)]
*  Well, that's going to drive a lot of the decision making that's going to happen in the next 24 [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  hours. You know, can Israel absorb this attack from Iran or will Israel domestic politics [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  insist that it's got to respond in some way, like maybe going after where those missiles and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=330.32s)]
*  drones are launched from? There's a lot of domestic politics at play in every side. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=334.56s)]
*  And particularly right now with Iran, you know, the mullahs had to respond to that Israeli [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=338.64s)]
*  assassination of the leader. They had to do something. They haven't done a whole lot and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=343.92s)]
*  they haven't killed any Israelis so far that we know of. So maybe it rests there, maybe it escalates. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=351.04s)]
*  And so it's domestic politics in Iran, in Israel and in the United States. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=356.16s)]
*  Yep. And Joe says don't and lots of things still happen. So KT, thank you very much for your time [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6OZbi0EPQ&t=361.35999999999996s)]
