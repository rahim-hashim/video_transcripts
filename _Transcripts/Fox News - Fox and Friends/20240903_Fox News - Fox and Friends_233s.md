# 'Growing by the day': Cities overwhelmed by migrant surge
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho)
*  An illegal migrant from Honduras was arrested after he was accused of stabbing a teenage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=0.0s)]
*  girl at a baseball game in Indiana on Saturday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  This coming as a new report reveals migrants are making up 75% of the arrests in some parts [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=10.24s)]
*  of New York City. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=17.72s)]
*  Multiple arrests with the same people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=18.72s)]
*  Griff Jenkins is here with more. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=20.64s)]
*  Griff. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=22.12s)]
*  Yeah, good morning guys. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=23.12s)]
*  Look, the border crisis really hit home in the Midwest this weekend. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=24.12s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=27.0s)]
*  A previously deported illegal immigrant from Honduras was arrested Sunday, authorities [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=28.0s)]
*  said following an intense manhunt in Indiana after he was deemed a person of interest. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=32.2s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=37.4s)]
*  You see him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=38.4s)]
*  Demas Gabriel Yanez, 26 years old. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=39.4s)]
*  Now the Lake County Sheriff's Office says the manhunt began Saturday after a 14-year-old [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=42.08s)]
*  girl was stabbed in the hand with a butcher-style knife while at her brother's baseball game. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=46.92s)]
*  When the girl's mother tried to help, the migrant also tried to stab her before fleeing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=52.28s)]
*  Now the teen girl is OK, was treated and released from a hospital. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=57.2s)]
*  Yanez was apprehended Sunday after cops spotted him running through a cornfield. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  Investigators said he was in the process of trying to cut his hair to change his appearance [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=66.36s)]
*  and evade law enforcement. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  The sheriff's office said Yanez had been previously deported to Honduras in 2018 and quote, may [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  have been engaged in criminal activity across the United States since returning illegally. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=78.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, as you mentioned, Ainsley, in New York, police sources tell the New York Post [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=83.76s)]
*  75 percent, three out of four arrests in Midtown Manhattan for crimes like assault, robbery, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  domestic violence are migrants. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=94.0s)]
*  In parts of Queens, they say the figure is more than 60 percent. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=96.12s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=99.68s)]
*  They blame sanctuary laws for the spike. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=100.68s)]
*  And it's interesting to point out Mayor Eric Adams has been called on the City Council [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=104.28s)]
*  to change those sanctuary laws, try and get it under control. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  And finally, if you dig a little deeper in this New York Post article, it talks about [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=112.48s)]
*  the rise of that Trend Day Aragwa, that dangerous Venezuelan gang that's taken a foothold in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=117.28s)]
*  parts of the country like Aurora, Colorado and in New York City. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=122.84s)]
*  Remember, they were tied to the shooting of two NYPD officers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  They say this threat is growing by the day. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=132.72s)]
*  And, Griff, in that New York Post article, it also talks about these same migrants who [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=133.72s)]
*  game the system to come into the country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  They know exactly how the system works in the sanctuary city. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=140.74s)]
*  They'll go steal some stuff. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=144.18s)]
*  They know they're going to get arrested, but they'll be out in 15 minutes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=145.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=150.02s)]
*  In fact, there's a quote in the article from an anonymous person that works in the courts [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=151.02s)]
*  that says, come Mondays, it's all migrants. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=156.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=159.78s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=160.78s)]
*  Thanks, Griff. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=161.78s)]
*  If you read that article, too, it talks about a 31-year-old migrant. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=162.78s)]
*  He came into this country earlier this year. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  Been arrested five times. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=167.7s)]
*  Latest arrest was arrested for walking into the Target store and getting some pants and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=169.66s)]
*  a beer. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=174.06s)]
*  And they arrested me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=175.06s)]
*  He said, I wanted to change my clothes and sit down and think. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=176.06s)]
*  I didn't know Target sold beer. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=178.42s)]
*  Well, and it's not just the Chundi de Agua within Aurora that is going back. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=180.26s)]
*  And I don't know what the interim police chief is talking about in Aurora. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=185.82s)]
*  He's saying, oh, it's really not a problem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=188.78s)]
*  They've got city council members, community members showing video of them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=189.94s)]
*  And the governor says that, too. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=192.94s)]
*  Yeah, the governor is saying this nonsense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=193.94s)]
*  He wants to be president one day, by the way, saying that it's different apartment complexes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=195.98s)]
*  that they're taking over. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=200.54s)]
*  Now there's reporting going on in Chicago that the gangs within Chicago and the Chundi [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=201.54s)]
*  de Agua are going back and forth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=206.14s)]
*  So we got a crisis. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=208.06s)]
*  Wait, so American gangs are fighting foreign gangs. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=209.06s)]
*  Back and forth. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=211.38s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=212.38s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=213.38s)]
*  You know, Charlemagne the Godman, I interviewed him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=214.38s)]
*  He said the crazy thing that he was getting, people telling him that the gangs are taking [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=215.38s)]
*  on gangs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=218.74s)]
*  That's where New York is heading. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=219.74s)]
*  But you're saying Chicago headed there first. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=220.74s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=222.54s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5Uc_--nho&t=223.54s)]
