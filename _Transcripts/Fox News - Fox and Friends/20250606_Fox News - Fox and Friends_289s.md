# 'IDIOTS!': Sanctuary city mayor sparks OUTRAGE with anti-ICE rhetoric
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc)
*  Meanwhile, the Democrats are asking for some type of boycott against our ICE agents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=0.0s)]
*  They want their masks to be removed because they're trying to protect themselves from [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=4.44s)]
*  being doxed online. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=8.6s)]
*  Mayor Wu is the latest example of how they've been treating our ICE agents. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=11.16s)]
*  Of Boston? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=15.72s)]
*  Of Boston. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=16.72s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=17.72s)]
*  I don't know of any police department that routinely wears masks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=19.84s)]
*  We know that there are other groups that routinely wear masks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=27.36s)]
*  NSC 131 routinely wears masks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=30.12s)]
*  What I said is that Boston police and no police department that I know of at the local level [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=41.84s)]
*  routinely wears masks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=46.28s)]
*  So the White House is calling her out for stoking hatred against our law enforcement, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  But she's doubling down on this rhetoric. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=52.88s)]
*  And the largest ICE operation ever took place in Boston. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  It's called Operation Patriot. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=61.56s)]
*  And it resulted in the arrest of nearly 1,500 illegal immigrants. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=64.2s)]
*  Now Fox News was embedded with these ICE agents just for a few hours. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=67.72s)]
*  While we were embedded, agents were arrested. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=72.2s)]
*  They took down a murderer, two child rapists, one who lived next to a playground, one fentanyl [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=75.36s)]
*  rapist, one child sexual assaulter. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=82.0s)]
*  That all happened within a few hours. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=85.24s)]
*  But overall, they arrested 1,461 illegal aliens. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=86.76s)]
*  790 of them had criminal convictions or charges. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=92.04s)]
*  277 had final removal or deportation orders. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=95.92s)]
*  They are keeping the streets of Boston safe without the help of Massachusetts because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=100.56s)]
*  it is a sanctuary state. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  My officers and agents walk into danger so other people can sleep safely at night. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=109.68s)]
*  So kids can make it to school safely and play outside. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=114.68s)]
*  So while it's easy to be an armchair quarterback and make up talking points that get activists [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=118.28s)]
*  riled up, the bottom line is my officers and agents are out there protecting the same people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  who are threatening their safety. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=127.84s)]
*  Law enforcement's common sense. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=129.68s)]
*  Politicians need to stop putting my people in danger. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=132.24s)]
*  I'm not asking them to stop. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=134.44s)]
*  I'm demanding that they stop. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Here's what I have to say to Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  and anyone else stirring up the outrage about what ICE does. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  These are real people with real families you're hurting with your ridiculous rhetoric and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=146.6s)]
*  inflammatory comments. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  And it's time to remember that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=152.64s)]
*  The worst things the Democrats ever said and most of what walked the back was to fund the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  police. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=159.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=160.16s)]
*  Re-imagine police. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=161.16s)]
*  And they spent the next six years trying to tell everyone that was just a few handful [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=162.16s)]
*  of people in the squad. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=165.64s)]
*  This is the same thing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=167.44s)]
*  And the reason why they cover their faces is two reasons. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=168.92s)]
*  One, a lot of these guys are picking up international terrorists. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=170.64s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=173.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=174.16s)]
*  International terrorists. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=175.16s)]
*  Number two is because of the aggression on the left of people doxing, following, getting [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=176.16s)]
*  in between ICE and illegal immigrants, they have to worry about their identity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=179.52s)]
*  You think they want to wear a mask? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=184.2s)]
*  Also, you're upset that ICE is wearing a mask, but you're not upset that Harvard students [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=186.04s)]
*  are wearing a mask. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=189.76s)]
*  You're not upset that NYU, City College, UCLA, they're not wearing a mask. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=190.76s)]
*  You have no idea what the mask ban is about. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=194.6s)]
*  You can't get the governor of New York to support a mask ban. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=196.32s)]
*  But you have law enforcement agents covering their face for their identity and now you're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  saying take the mask off as if that would change the operation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  And just understand, you are saying to fund the police. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=208.44s)]
*  You got midterms coming up. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=211.04s)]
*  I hope you pay that penalty. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's not just the doxing that's going on when it comes to our ICE agents, but you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=213.84s)]
*  got the cartel that is targeting them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=217.48s)]
*  They're breaking up major operations every single day. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=219.56s)]
*  I just got to ask the Democrats, is thank you not in your vocabulary? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=223.32s)]
*  They just took, without your help at all, you gave them no resources, no sources and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=227.84s)]
*  methods, took over a thousand criminals off your street. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  You would think they would thank the ICE agents for this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=237.44s)]
*  They're saying, so what are they saying? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=240.12s)]
*  They want the rapist, they want the child sex predator rapist to live next to the school? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=241.56s)]
*  They want him to stay in his house and watch all the little kids? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=246.68s)]
*  Is that what they're saying? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=249.72s)]
*  They want the ICE agents to arrest the child rapist without a mask, you idiots. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=250.76s)]
*  The last thing is, they wanted to go undercover sometimes too. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=254.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=258.4s)]
*  So you cover, you can go undercover, but not the guy I recognize on Boston television and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=259.4s)]
*  on Fox News. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=263.64s)]
*  Can't do it, but now we can. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=264.96s)]
*  Grow out the beard, you go underneath, you talk to people that work in narcotics. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=266.64s)]
*  They always have some type of costume going on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=270.76s)]
*  So Todd Lans, the acting ICE director who you just heard from, he will be on our show [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=273.08s)]
*  at 8.30. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=277.16s)]
*  We'll ask him about this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=278.16s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=279.16s)]
*  Try and kill me. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_9LxCojExc&t=280.16s)]
