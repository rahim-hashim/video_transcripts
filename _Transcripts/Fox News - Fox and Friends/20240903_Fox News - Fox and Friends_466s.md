*  restrained by a group of men. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=39.64s)]
*  They're shouting Yankee go home [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  before a bag is put over that Marines head. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=43.36s)]
*  You can see another Marine [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  who's also in plain clothes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=47.599999999999994s)]

*  Now this incident took place yesterday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=86.92s)]
*  In the coastal city of Izmir, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=88.6s)]
*  which is in the western part of Turkey, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  where the USS Wasp arrived a day ago [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=92.44s)]
*  after the hospital these Marines then [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  were able to return to their ship. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  Brian, thanks so much. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=98.88s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=100.08s)]
*  Alright 29 minutes now after the hour. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Let's expand on this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  Let's bring in GOP center Mark [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=103.96s)]
*  Wayne Mullen. He sits on Armed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=105.75999999999999s)]

*  That's a NATO ally, but we know Turkey. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=109.44s)]
*  A lot of the people are hostile towards US, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  but this was about going up for the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=114.8s)]
*  Palestinians in our support for Israel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=117.32s)]
*  What is your takeaway? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=119.64s)]
*  You know, we can't support Israel enough. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=121.92s)]
*  Unfortunately, what you do, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=124.28s)]
*  what you have here is revision or [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  country that shouldn't exist. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=127.32s)]
*  Brian, you have you have a party that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  is openly embracing Hamas and terrorist [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=130.44s)]
*  organization that they are, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=132.48s)]
*  and that's the Democrat Party. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=133.72s)]
*  And this right here is what happens [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=135.12s)]
*  when they when our leader in the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=137.24s)]
*  White House shows weakness and they [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=139.48s)]
*  do instead of having peace through [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=141.28s)]
*  strength they have a piece to appeasement. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=143.24s)]
*  You end up having people that they [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=146.04s)]
*  don't respect and they don't fear [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=148.12s)]
*  the United States. This should never [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=149.92s)]
*  have happened. I commend the service [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=151.84s)]
*  members you're seeing right there on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=153.72s)]
*  the video because these individuals [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=155.64s)]
*  show great restraint. I guarantee you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=157.32s)]
*  if these individuals wanted to cut it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=159.28s)]
*  loose they could cut it loose and those [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  individuals that were attacking them [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=163.68s)]
*  would be slaying on the ground. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=165.16s)]
*  You see the Marine being very calm. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=166.76s)]
*  Even the one that ran in there [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=168.56s)]
*  didn't run in there throwing punches. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  He ran in there simply pushing people back. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=171.92s)]
*  I guarantee you that had very strict orders [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=174.08s)]
*  when they left the ship to not engage. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  Otherwise these individuals would be. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  It is to be a much different story and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=180.4s)]
*  so why I hate to see this I commend [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  those Marines for the restraint that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  they had, but this should never happen. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=186.52s)]
*  If we had a tougher commander in chief [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  that stood solid with Israel and bleed [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  in peace through strength and member [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=192.8s)]
*  Erdogan has said I'm he's tempted to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=194.4s)]
*  put troops into Gaza to help out Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=196.44s)]
*  So you know exactly where the people stand. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  So let's talk about something. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=201.08s)]
*  Go ahead. What's what's the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=202.52s)]
*  matter with that Brian? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=204.12s)]
*  As you know, there's a very important [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=205.12s)]
*  base that we have in Turkey that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  there's a partnership with a very [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=209.4s)]
*  strategic important base that we have. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  And in any given time the disruption [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=213.68s)]
*  of that base could disrupt a lot of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=216.12s)]
*  security measures we have in the region, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  so we still have to have a relationship [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=221.44s)]
*  with Erdogan and Turkey and being a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  NATO ally this stuff shouldn't happen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  But this is why we have I go back to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  Brian, a weak leader causes this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=231.44s)]
*  type of action to happen or non leader [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=233.28s)]
*  who spends all this time on the beach [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  instead of letting everybody know where [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=237.44s)]
*  he stands and this must seem like a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=239.28s)]
*  foreign country to you because I have [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=241.44s)]
*  three affiliates for affiliates over [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=243.44s)]
*  in Oklahoma. I've been there a lot. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  What do you think when you see what's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=246.88s)]
*  happening in New York City 7000 people [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  just 48 hours after the assassination [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=251.28s)]
*  of six of six hostages we have this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=253.28s)]
*  type of unrest in the streets of New [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=255.76s)]
*  York City for palette. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=258.28s)]
*  For the Palestinians, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=259.68s)]
*  what is your takeaway from that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=260.64s)]
*  For me there needs to be some type [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=262.48s)]
*  of investigation into outside [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUA5t6GZN0&t=264.96s)]
