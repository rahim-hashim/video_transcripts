# Democrat suffers blowout loss as Senate flips red
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q)
*  Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  John Tester, extending the GOP Senate majority [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=3.4s)]
*  and paving the way for Trump's agenda [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=6.68s)]
*  to become law in January. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=8.44s)]
*  Senator-elect Tim Sheehy joins us right now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=10.24s)]
*  Senator-elect, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people are excited [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  for another door kicker to be in Washington. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=17.72s)]
*  You didn't only defeat him, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=20.76s)]
*  but you blew him out of the water. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=22.48s)]
*  How were you able to do that? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=23.68s)]
*  Well, it was a lot of hard work, Lawrence, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=26.92s)]
*  and you're right, we got a lot of doors to kick [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=28.28s)]
*  because we had a lot of work to do. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=29.84s)]
*  I mean, we just heard from Mark Siegel about, you know, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=31.28s)]
*  how much problems we have with the FDA [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=33.16s)]
*  and just our basic food supply. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=35.04s)]
*  And, you know, our government is not functioning [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=36.8s)]
*  as well as it should. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=38.56s)]
*  It's not serving its people as well as it should. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=39.46s)]
*  It's not too much for the American people to ask [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=41.92s)]
*  that their government put the interests of our country first. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=44.0s)]
*  And I think when you asked why we won so handily, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=46.64s)]
*  I think that's what it comes down to is common sense. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=49.8s)]
*  I mean, our message was based on, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=51.68s)]
*  let's bring common sense back to our government. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Montana's want a secure border, safe streets, cheap gas, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=56.36s)]
*  cops are good, criminals are bad, boys are boys, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=59.12s)]
*  girls are girls. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=61.16s)]
*  And that kind of message where, you know, policy, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=62.0s)]
*  you know, initiatives and identity politics, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=64.72s)]
*  I think falls to the side when people say, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=67.2s)]
*  I just want a government that does its job, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=68.64s)]
*  makes my life better and gets out of my way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  And that's really what our campaign's been focused on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=74.72s)]
*  I think common sense is resonating with people [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=77.08s)]
*  and that's why we won so big. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=79.28s)]
*  So Tim, it looks like the former president has set an agenda. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=80.72s)]
*  You just highlighted it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=83.64s)]
*  The Republican party has a massive coalition right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=85.44s)]
*  Black folks, Hispanic folks, working class folks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=88.92s)]
*  I mean, it's a diverse party at this point. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=91.8s)]
*  The question is, once it gets to the Senate, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=94.32s)]
*  how are you gonna pass this legislation? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=96.6s)]
*  So when it's time to cast this private vote, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=98.32s)]
*  I know it is private, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  who are you gonna support for the leadership of the Senate? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=102.16s)]
*  Well, I don't even know many of these guys yet, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=107.36s)]
*  to be quite honest with you, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=109.28s)]
*  as you know, I'm a first time candidate for anything, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=110.12s)]
*  not even student council I ever run for. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  So I'll get to know some of these folks [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=114.16s)]
*  in the next few weeks here when I get there [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=116.64s)]
*  and start to figure out what priorities are gonna align best [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  with the America First agenda. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=121.8s)]
*  Again, it's about common sense. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=123.64s)]
*  So we'll see who's on the docket when we get there, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  but not sure it's gonna be yet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  I got a lot of folks I have to get to know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=129.88s)]
*  in a short period of time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=131.2s)]
*  I will say we have a fantastic freshman class here [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=132.2s)]
*  with our Senate group. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=135.0s)]
*  I think those of us who've been called [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=135.88s)]
*  and those who look like they're gonna be called [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=137.4s)]
*  are some fantastic, not just candidates, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=139.68s)]
*  but they're gonna be fantastic senators too. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Tim, I get the impression [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=144.2s)]
*  there's gonna be a lot to do on this agenda [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=145.96s)]
*  when it comes to passing legislation, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=147.8s)]
*  but is the border, is it fair to say the border [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=150.08s)]
*  is gonna be the number one priority [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to legislation? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=154.84s)]
*  Obviously, we expect day one, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=156.28s)]
*  the president to sign some executive orders [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=158.0s)]
*  to really put a stop at the border, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=160.32s)]
*  but from a legislative standpoint, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=162.4s)]
*  is that the first thing you guys tackle? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=164.32s)]
*  I think it's so important [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=168.36s)]
*  the border has a legislative solution. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=171.32s)]
*  The border has been, you know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=173.12s)]
*  in the hands of the executive, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=174.56s)]
*  and of course it's a hot potato issue, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=176.08s)]
*  goes back and forth. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  One executive seals it, the next administration unseals it, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=178.48s)]
*  and it gets, we need to pass legislation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=181.24s)]
*  that by law secures the border in perpetuity, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=184.48s)]
*  and in addition to the border, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  creates metrics around immigration [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=191.04s)]
*  and funding for border security [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=193.36s)]
*  that are gonna be enduring and can't just be undone [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=194.88s)]
*  or overwritten with executive orders. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  So yes, I believe that will be, if not the first, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=199.2s)]
*  you know, among the top, and then of course, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=201.84s)]
*  we've got to get inflation under control, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=203.84s)]
*  we've got to stop printing money, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  but of course those issues are linked, you know? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=206.44s)]
*  Massive immigration into this country [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=208.4s)]
*  has a direct impact on the economy of this country, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=211.08s)]
*  and we've had more people come into this country [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=213.16s)]
*  than we've ever had in the history of our nation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=215.32s)]
*  in a very short period of time, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  whether it's housing, whether it's healthcare, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=218.88s)]
*  whether it's inflation, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=221.28s)]
*  that issue has a direct impact on the economy too. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  So we've got to solve both those things, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  and that's gonna be our top priority. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Senator-elect, congratulations, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=227.36s)]
*  the special operations community, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE5pKg0ju4Q&t=229.48000000000002s)]
