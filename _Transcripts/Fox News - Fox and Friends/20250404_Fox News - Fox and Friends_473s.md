# Pelosi 'sounds like Trump' in flashback video: 'BIGGEST HOAX OF ALL'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM)
*  So, I mean, we watched what happened in the markets yesterday, and it was expected, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=0.0s)]
*  it was pretty steep, and nobody likes to look at their 401K, the Dow down almost 4 percent, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=4.28s)]
*  S&P and NASDAQ down. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=9.36s)]
*  And we'll see where it goes today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=11.36s)]
*  But I think the one thing that could reverse the trend is when these countries, if the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=12.98s)]
*  president accepts their call and their offer, because he also wants the revenue, if these [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=17.32s)]
*  countries come in and say, we're zeroing out our tariffs, we're going to get, we're going [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  to match you with our tariffs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=25.52s)]
*  For example, I'm a little confused that Vietnam came in two days ago and they said, we'll [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=27.2s)]
*  zero out our tariffs, but the president still slammed them, and we do a lot of textile work [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=31.36s)]
*  there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=35.6s)]
*  And then Israel said, we'll zero out our tariffs, and the president still hit them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=36.6s)]
*  So I don't know if that's a clerical thing or is that, you know, we have to go with the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=40.68s)]
*  trade representative and work that into the budget. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=44.84s)]
*  But what's amazing to me, guys, is that Nancy Pelosi sounds like Donald Trump today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=48.16s)]
*  We are great staff got this fantastic clip from 1996 because this had been a concern [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=54.26s)]
*  for years from Donald Trump when he was just a businessman, certain lawmakers, a lot of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=60.3s)]
*  Democrats that are free trade agreements that were going to hurt the worker. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=64.86s)]
*  And guys like Ross Perot in 1992 said it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=70.1s)]
*  But listen to Pelosi, different hairstyle, same woman. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=73.1s)]
*  And by the way, original hips, 1996, June 27. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=76.74s)]
*  That we know of. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=80.58s)]
*  In terms of tariffs, I think it's interesting to note that the average US MFM tariff on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=82.58000000000001s)]
*  Chinese goods coming into the United States is 2 percent, whereas the average Chinese [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  MFM tariff on US goods going into China is 35 percent. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=93.7s)]
*  Is that reciprocal? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=98.78s)]
*  In terms of jobs, this is the biggest and cruelest hoax of all. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Not only do we not have market access, not only do they have prohibitive tariffs, not [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=105.78s)]
*  only are our exports not let in very specifically, but China benefits with at least, at least [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=110.34s)]
*  10 million jobs from US-China trade. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=117.98s)]
*  China trade supports 170,000 jobs in the United States, 170,000 jobs, whereas our imports [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  from China support 10 million jobs at least. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=131.02s)]
*  The fact is that US-China trade is a job loser. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=135.0s)]
*  I just find this incredible, Anselaine Bryant. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=139.82s)]
*  You know, they give speeches all the time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  But the passion that she speaks when she's talking about this issue, I mean, I was four [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=146.18s)]
*  at the time when she gave this speech. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=150.82s)]
*  What changed? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=154.26s)]
*  Has she evolved on the issue? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=155.26s)]
*  Or does she not like the person that is now supporting essentially everything that she [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  just said in that clip? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=162.22s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=163.7s)]
*  Several things are going through my mind when you watch that clip. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  You were four. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=167.66s)]
*  I had just finished my freshman year of college. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=168.66s)]
*  And she sounds like Donald Trump now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=172.98s)]
*  That's how far their party has gone. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=175.66s)]
*  It's either that or they just hate Donald Trump so much they're melting down. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=178.34s)]
*  They haven't even given us a minute. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  This all just happened. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=185.62s)]
*  So we've got to take a breath. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=187.1s)]
*  The markets will calm down next week. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  We knew the markets were going to be volatile because of all this uncertainty. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=190.38s)]
*  It's always been that way. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=194.26s)]
*  And so as Secretary Brooke Rollins says, there will be a short term of uncertainty. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=195.9s)]
*  And then we'll move back to the prosperity that the president's envisioned. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=201.5s)]
*  Donald Trump says we're already getting chips. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=204.26s)]
*  We're already getting steel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=206.26s)]
*  Steel factories coming in. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=207.26s)]
*  GM, the car company, is ramping up production in the United States, increasing their U.S. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=208.26s)]
*  truck production by hiring temporary employees at the Fort Wayne, Indiana assembly plant. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=212.94s)]
*  But you have these Democrats that are melting down. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  They are now planning to force a vote to kill these tariffs, which they probably don't have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=220.58s)]
*  the votes to do. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=224.17999999999998s)]
*  And then when it comes to TikTok, that's a big deal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=226.22s)]
*  This weekend is the deadline. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=229.27999999999997s)]
*  So Donald Trump is saying if China wants to negotiate on tariffs, do a deal on TikTok. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=232.38s)]
*  Maybe I'll consider it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=237.26s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=238.26s)]
*  For instance, with TikTok as an example, we have the situation with TikTok where China [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=239.26s)]
*  probably say, we'll approve a deal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=249.62s)]
*  But will you do something on the tariff? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=252.5s)]
*  The tariffs give us great power to negotiate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=254.86s)]
*  Always have. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=258.18s)]
*  I've used them very well in the first administration, as you saw. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=259.18s)]
*  But now we're taking it to a whole new level because it's a worldwide situation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's very exciting to see. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  Is that something that you floated to them or you've heard from them? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=272.32s)]
*  I'm just using that as an example. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=275.94s)]
*  Let's say we had a problem with TikTok and let's say China was it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=278.42s)]
*  Where to approve? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=282.14000000000004s)]
*  We could use tariffs in order to get it approved. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=283.8s)]
*  You know, the deadline is something in return. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=289.98s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=291.98s)]
*  Number one, when it comes to TikTok, I don't want to talk about that later, but the sale [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=293.3s)]
*  has got to be complete. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  They can't have any sign of the algorithm because it's a national security interest. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=297.86s)]
*  I don't care about the money. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=301.86s)]
*  They're not going to want to sell because this is all about espionage, in my view. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=302.86s)]
*  The president's saying I'm going to use leverage when I can. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=306.7s)]
*  And if I want something done, whether it's Russia, whether it's, you know, whether it's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=309.58s)]
*  something in the Middle East, if Jordan wants a break or whatever it is, if they could do [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  some of Gaza, I will use all levers of power. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=316.86s)]
*  And I think it's true. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=319.3s)]
*  Also, General Motors came out and said, we'll be making operational adjustments to Fort [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=320.5s)]
*  Wayne, as you guys mentioned. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=324.82s)]
*  Ford has already said they're making adjustments. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  People coming home. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  He mentioned that Oracle is going to do the TikTok deal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  They'll be at the hub of it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=331.86s)]
*  And word from Charles Gasparino with the TikTok deal. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=333.34s)]
*  They don't believe Amazon should be a part of it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=336.06s)]
*  They got so many products from China there and it might be a little bit difficult to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=337.85999999999996s)]
*  sign off on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  But JD Vance was sitting down with you, Lawrence. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  And here's what he said about the deal that could come down today. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=345.18s)]
*  We've been working very hard, me and the president, the entire team, to really accomplish two [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  things. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=353.9s)]
*  First of all, you want to make sure that the TikTok app in the United States is not spying [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=354.9s)]
*  on people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=358.38s)]
*  It's good for national security. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=359.38s)]
*  You also want to give people access to this incredible platform, which as we know, that's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  where a lot of young people get their news. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=365.18s)]
*  That's where a lot of young people found out about the policies of the Trump administration. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=367.14s)]
*  And we got to accomplish both of those things. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=371.14s)]
*  I think that we're in a good place. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=372.94s)]
*  We're going to keep on working at it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=374.5s)]
*  But I'll let the president make that announcement. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  If it doesn't come out before the deadline, because I know the president extended. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=377.3s)]
*  It'll come out before the deadline. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  It will come out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=382.34000000000003s)]
*  We got to wait a couple of days to continue working on it to finalize some things. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  And of course, we're going to let the president announce whatever we ultimately decide. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=386.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=389.06s)]
*  I'll just quick thing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=390.06s)]
*  We want that deal to come, but it's mainly a security thing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=392.3s)]
*  And we also have to put something out there that stops China from launching another app [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=394.62s)]
*  or anybody, North Korea, that becomes popular again. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=398.22s)]
*  But the only thing I want to add is Trump's doing everything at once. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=401.26000000000005s)]
*  Keep an eye on the big, beautiful bill making its way through the Senate. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  These are all normally it's bill six months off, trade deal six months. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=408.22s)]
*  Trump's doing everything at once. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=413.82000000000005s)]
*  So when the bill comes through with making the tax cuts permanent and it gets to the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=415.42s)]
*  House, they work it out later in the spring. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=419.38s)]
*  That's going to be a boon to the market. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  So I'm not Stuart Varney or Larry Kudlow, but don't overreact to today and tomorrow [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=423.26s)]
*  or yesterday. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=428.62s)]
*  Focus on the value of these companies because nothing has really changed, guys. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=430.78s)]
*  Well the deadline is tomorrow. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=435.82s)]
*  So it sounds like JD Vance says it's going to happen before the deadline, which means [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=437.46s)]
*  today. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  So maybe we'll hear something about this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  We'll continue to watch this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=443.38s)]
*  But will he is there any way that you think he could push the deadline? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=445.34s)]
*  He could. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=448.7s)]
*  Farther down the road like he's done in the past? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=449.7s)]
*  He could. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=451.18s)]
*  As I asked JD Vance yesterday, what's going to happen if they don't get the deal, he was [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=452.78s)]
*  adamant that the president is going to get the deal before the deadline. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=457.26s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=460.86s)]
*  That's in a couple of days. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gozfUVtVM&t=461.86s)]
