# Menendez Brothers set to appear virtually in court Monday
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0)
*  Tomorrow, Lyle and Eric Menendez are set to be seen and heard for the first time in years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=0.0s)]
*  The two brothers, who have been serving life sentences without possibility of parole for killing their parents, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=7.0s)]
*  are set to appear virtually for a status hearing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=13.0s)]
*  Outgoing Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascones recommended the case be resentenced, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=16.0s)]
*  which is a decision the next DA wants to review. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=22.0s)]
*  Here to discuss is former federal prosecutor Nima Ramani. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=25.0s)]
*  Good to see you, sir. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=29.0s)]
*  I'm fascinated by this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=30.0s)]
*  These guys have been behind bars for 34 years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=32.0s)]
*  And you've got the Los Angeles outgoing district attorney saying, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=36.0s)]
*  we need to reopen up the sentencing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=40.0s)]
*  And it seems to be predicated largely on a documentary, a Netflix documentary that's gotten people's attention. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=42.0s)]
*  That seems odd since this should be kind of a legal thing, I would think. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=52.0s)]
*  Is this more about the popularity of the show or more about a real difference in legally how we should look at this? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=56.0s)]
*  It is fascinating and it's really the power of a Netflix series. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=63.0s)]
*  We've seen it time and time again when a documentary can completely change the course of a legal case. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=68.0s)]
*  Britney Spears was freed from her conservatorship largely because of a documentary. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=73.0s)]
*  R. Kelly was finally brought to justice because of a documentary. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=78.0s)]
*  Folks like Bob Durst, the documentary, The Jinx, and Jeffries, the Abercrombie and Finch CEO, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=81.0s)]
*  finally brought to justice because of a documentary. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=87.0s)]
*  But the Netflix series Monsters has really shown a spotlight on the sexual abuse that the brothers suffered. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=90.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of public support for their release. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=96.0s)]
*  And we know that every prosecutor in this country is either elected or appointed by someone who is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=99.0s)]
*  So there's certainly politics at play here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=105.0s)]
*  The outgoing DA, George Gascon, said, I want to relook at the sentencing for this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=107.0s)]
*  He lost the election for his seat. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=113.0s)]
*  And we've got a new DA in Los Angeles who said, I will look at the case again, but he hasn't made any decisions or promises. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=116.0s)]
*  Has there has there been new evidence that's come to light that would perhaps change the new DA's view on the case [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=125.0s)]
*  and open up the possibility that the brothers could be granted parole? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=132.0s)]
*  There's two key pieces of evidence, but they're certainly not new. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=137.0s)]
*  They were included in the habeas petition filed last year. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=140.0s)]
*  That is that Jose Menendez also abused an individual named Roy Rossell√≥. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=144.0s)]
*  He was a member of the Mexican boy band Menudo. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=150.0s)]
*  And one of the brothers wrote a letter to his cousin detailing the abuse eight months before the murders. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=152.0s)]
*  This was all included in a habeas petition filed in early 2023. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=159.0s)]
*  Of course, right before the election, George Gascon decided to recommend re-sentencing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=164.0s)]
*  Of course, he lost. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=170.0s)]
*  Now, it's really up to incoming District Attorney Nathan Hockman. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=172.0s)]
*  The question is, is he going to honor that request? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=175.0s)]
*  In his public statements during the election, he didn't take a position one way or another, nor has he since he has been district attorney elect. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=178.0s)]
*  So tomorrow's status hearing is going to be really important. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=186.0s)]
*  The question is, are prosecutors going to detail what Hockman intends to do? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=189.0s)]
*  Because I think that's the key piece of evidence, because the re-sentencing hearing isn't until December 11th and Hockman takes office on December 2nd. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=195.0s)]
*  You know, they're doing a lottery system to give out tickets to watch this remote appearance by the Menendez brothers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=203.0s)]
*  I mean, does that surprise you that it's become such a spectacle? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=213.0s)]
*  It doesn't. This is my hometown of Los Angeles, and this is probably the biggest case here since O.J. Simpson. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=217.0s)]
*  There's a lot of support for Eric and Lyle being released. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=225.0s)]
*  People want to be in that courtroom. There's only 16 seats available to the public and two standby seats. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=230.0s)]
*  So there's going to be a long line outside of that courthouse tomorrow morning. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=236.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable stuff. Nima, great analysis. Thanks for being with us today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=240.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Brian. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCfTayL5ye0&t=244.0s)]
