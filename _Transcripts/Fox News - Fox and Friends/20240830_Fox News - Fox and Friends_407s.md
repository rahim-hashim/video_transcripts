# Kamala Harris has no regrets about lying to America: Lara Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI)
*  Well, after being shielded from the media for over a month, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris finally sat down for a first interview, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=3.6s)]
*  27 minutes long, and says America is ready for a new way forward. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=12.0s)]
*  for President of the United States [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=16.4s)]
*  and to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=18.2s)]
*  which is a new way forward, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=23.0s)]
*  and turn the page on the last decade [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=25.0s)]
*  of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=27.8s)]
*  But the last decade, of course, the last three and a half years, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=35.4s)]
*  has been part of your administration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=38.2s)]
*  I'm talking about an era that started about a decade ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=39.8s)]
*  That's kind of a funny moment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Let's bring in Republican National Committee co-chair [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  and Trump campaign surrogate, Laura Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=49.6s)]
*  Good morning to you, Laura. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=52.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=53.8s)]
*  Okay, Dana Bash asked a lot of the questions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=54.8s)]
*  We've been talking about for the last week. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=57.2s)]
*  What's your headline from last night's show? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=59.2s)]
*  I mean, honestly, Steve, it feels like Kamala Harris is running for junior class president [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  versus President of the United States. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=67.2s)]
*  You've got no specifics whatsoever. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=69.0s)]
*  And there was not a moment that I watched that interview [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=71.4s)]
*  and I, as an American citizen, felt confident that this is a person [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=74.4s)]
*  who understands the job of President of the United States, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  has a true plan of action to do anything for America, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=80.0s)]
*  could negotiate with the world leaders on behalf of me as a citizen in this country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=83.8s)]
*  And I think it's kind of what we've come to expect from Kamala Harris. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=89.6s)]
*  Look, she had to have her emotional support animal of Tim Walsh with her for this interview. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  And she had such an opportunity. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=98.8s)]
*  The first question Dana Bash asked her was, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=100.4s)]
*  what would you do day one? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=103.2s)]
*  And she had an opportunity to really go in depth on policy, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=105.0s)]
*  say, here's how I will be as president. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=107.8s)]
*  She said, essentially, I want to help the middle class. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=110.0s)]
*  No specifics, no real way that she would achieve that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=112.4s)]
*  I'll tell you what day one she did as vice president alongside Joe Biden. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=115.4s)]
*  They shut down the Keystone XL pipeline. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=119.0s)]
*  That, of course, took away our energy independence, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  weakened our standing on the world stage, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=124.0s)]
*  drove up gas prices, drove up inflation and hurt who? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=126.0s)]
*  The middle and the working classes in this country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  A lot of platitudes, a lot of word salads. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=133.8s)]
*  And then if you wanted a real example as to how phony Kamala Harris really is, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=136.8s)]
*  I actually think it's the moment where she told the story about Joe Biden calling her. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=142.0s)]
*  You know, it was a Sunday. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=147.0s)]
*  I was cooking bacon and oh, the phone rang. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=148.6s)]
*  They put together a puzzle. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=151.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, as though Ed McVann had just surprised her by showing up with a giant check. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=153.2s)]
*  If anyone believes she did not know that there was an orchestrated plan underway [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=158.2s)]
*  to get Joe Biden out of office and plug her in as their candidate, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=163.0s)]
*  I've got a bridge and a couple of gold watches to sell you, Steve. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=167.8s)]
*  In Times Square, I saw those yesterday. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=171.6s)]
*  Laura, here's one other sound bite where, you know, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=174.4s)]
*  we've all seen Joe Biden's decline over the last year or so, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  but she has been steadfast before he dropped out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  She said, no, he's completely with it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=185.4s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  After the debate, you insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=189.4s)]
*  Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=194.4s)]
*  No, not at all. Not at all. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=202.2s)]
*  He has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgment and disposition [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=208.4s)]
*  that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know what, Laura, Joe Biden was in bad shape. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=220.4s)]
*  The New York Times, to their credit, yesterday ran an item that said, essentially, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=223.6s)]
*  you know, we heard that the top advisors for Biden went and talked to the senators. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=228.2s)]
*  And at the Senate meeting, apparently, Senator Jack Reed said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  if Joe Biden wanted to stay in the office, he should submit to an examination [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  by two independent neurologists who were willing to report their findings at a live news conference. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=244.2s)]
*  And apparently, the extraordinary thing about that was everybody around said, Joe's got to go. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=250.0s)]
*  But Joe Biden's advisors never told Joe Biden the Senate wanted him to go. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=256.6s)]
*  It wasn't until Chuck Schumer showed up at the beach house on the weekend where he goes, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=262.0s)]
*  what do you mean they didn't tell you? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=267.0s)]
*  Everybody wants you to go. So he was in bad shape. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=268.6s)]
*  That's my point. Well, he's in bad shape right now, Steve. He's on the beach. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=271.8s)]
*  He's been on vacation for two weeks. Who is running the country? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  And what you heard there from Kamala Harris, I think is very important. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=281.0s)]
*  No, she has no regrets, America, about lying to you about the cognitive ability [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=284.2s)]
*  of the current president of the United States. He is not up to the job of president. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=289.2s)]
*  That is very scary. We tried to call this out during the election in 2020 and warn people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=294.4s)]
*  This was problematic for this country. Here we are right now with an inept president [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=300.0s)]
*  who doesn't seem to be on the job whatsoever. And you want us to give Kamala Harris, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=304.8s)]
*  and continues to lie about it and opportunity? I don't think so. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=310.6s)]
*  The American people deserve better. They deserve someone who day one can do the job, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  who has done the job, and that's President Donald J. Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=318.8s)]
*  Speaking of President Trump, yesterday he made a statement that nobody saw this coming. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=321.6s)]
*  He said if he wins, he would make IVF free. Didn't say how it would work or who would pay for it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=326.8s)]
*  Where'd that come from? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=334.0s)]
*  Well, I'm sure Donald Trump, unlike Kamala Harris, will actually articulate [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=336.0s)]
*  the ways in which he will go about doing such a thing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=339.4s)]
*  Here's what the Democrats are running on, Steve. They are running on emotion, vibes, and abortion. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  You saw the mobile abortion ban that they had at the DNC. You could get a taco and an abortion right outside. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  Really nice. Wow. What a great thing for America. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=352.4s)]
*  That is what they're running on, and they continue to lie about Donald Trump and his stance on abortion and IVF. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=355.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has said multiple times, I will not sign a federal abortion ban. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=361.2s)]
*  They continue to lie, as did Tim Walsh in his speech at the DNC about Donald Trump's stance on IVF. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=366.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wants more babies in America, not fewer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=373.0s)]
*  He is very pro the miracle that IVF has given to so many families across this country, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=376.8s)]
*  and he wanted to make his stance on that explicitly clear, and that's why he talked about it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=382.6s)]
*  Okay, he did indeed. I'm sure we'll hear more details as the weekend approaches. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=386.8s)]
*  Laura, thank you very much for joining us on this Friday. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=391.4s)]
*  You got it. Thanks a lot. You bet. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Dk7pL_zXI&t=394.6s)]
