# VP Vance defends free speech after man's arrest for praying outside abortion clinic
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg)
*  The back slide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of religious [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=0.0s)]
*  Britons in particular in the crosshairs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=7.08s)]
*  A little over two years ago, the British government charged Adam Smith Connor, a 51-year-old physiotherapist [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=10.6s)]
*  and an Army veteran, with the heinous crime of standing 50 meters from an abortion clinic [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=17.22s)]
*  and silently praying for three minutes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=25.12s)]
*  Not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=28.6s)]
*  Vice President Vance taking a strong stance for free speech and religious liberty on the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=35.0s)]
*  international stage this weekend. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  Adam Smith Connor, who was highlighted in the speech, joins us now along with Senior [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=41.68s)]
*  Legal Communications Officer for the Alliance Defending Freedom International, Lois McClatchy [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=45.64s)]
*  Miller. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=51.56s)]
*  Welcome to you both. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=52.64s)]
*  What an honor to have you both on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=53.64s)]
*  I'm going to start with you, Adam. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=54.96s)]
*  How surprised were you that Vice President Vance chose to highlight your story as an [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=56.68s)]
*  example of how Europe is losing its values? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=64.08s)]
*  I was incredibly surprised. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  I had no idea it was going to happen. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=71.8s)]
*  I was a physiotherapist. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=74.32s)]
*  I was treating a patient. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=76.0s)]
*  I just had a few minutes gap between patients and Lois's number came up on my phone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  So I quickly answered it and she said, the Vice President of America is talking about [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=83.24s)]
*  your case. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  So it was incredibly surprising and I'm very grateful to him for highlighting this case. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  So take us back to when you were in front of that abortion clinic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=93.72s)]
*  Why were you there and what were you doing? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  So I've been part of 40 days for life for a few years and we pray, we offer help to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  women and we have a phone number that people can call. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=110.36s)]
*  I wasn't doing any of that on this occasion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  On this occasion, I had no banner. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't saying anything aloud. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't even particularly close to the clinic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=123.72s)]
*  I was behind a tree obscured from view and I was there for not very long. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=126.52s)]
*  I was there for about three or four minutes silently praying. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=133.48s)]
*  I wasn't interfering with anyone and these two officers came up to me, asked me what [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=140.12s)]
*  I was doing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  I said I was praying and then amazingly, shockingly, they asked me what was the nature of my prayer [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  and it was my answer to that question that I was praying for my son, Jacob, who they [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=155.4s)]
*  knew had died in an abortion that led to my prosecution. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=160.32s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=165.88s)]
*  I'm really taken aback. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=169.72s)]
*  Lois, tell me about what happens now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=171.16s)]
*  So he was prosecuted, you guys are now appealing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=173.88s)]
*  What are the penalties? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=176.88s)]
*  For those of us who don't understand British law, take us through that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=178.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=181.52s)]
*  Adam was convicted on account of his silent prayer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=182.52s)]
*  He now stands a criminal because of his thoughts and he was ordered to pay Â£9,000 to the other [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  side who prosecuted him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=191.6s)]
*  As a result, ADF International are supporting Adam's legal defense as we seek to appeal [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=193.52s)]
*  this judgment in July, but this intervention from President Vance highlighting the case, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=197.76s)]
*  that's really exposed that this is the worst example of censorship in the West right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  If we cannot think thoughts in our head on certain British streets, then we have no hope [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=207.12s)]
*  for freedom anywhere else. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it is truly stunning, although I can't sit here as an American and say that we're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  clean of any of this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=220.0s)]
*  The last administration imprisoned plenty of pro-life activists who were in front of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=221.72s)]
*  clinics as well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=226.84s)]
*  Thankfully, Donald Trump has set them free. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  Adam, what's your message to the British government, to Western powers, just as JD Vance was up [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  there? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=236.44s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=237.44s)]
*  What would you like to say about any of this? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=238.44s)]
*  Well, my case is not an exception. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=240.44s)]
*  I'm very grateful that mine was highlighted, but JD Vance could have spoken about Claire [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  Brennan, who has been prosecuted in Northern Ireland for saying the Lord's Prayer, could [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  have spoken about Stephen Green, who was prosecuted and had his appeal turned down. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  His appeal, he was doubly prosecuted in a sense for holding a Bible verse in Ealing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  in London and Isabelle Vaughan Spruce in Birmingham, who has been arrested twice and is being [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=265.36s)]
*  harassed continuously by the police for silently praying. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=273.28s)]
*  There's Sean Goff, also in Birmingham, who was, they attempted to prosecute him for having [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=278.16s)]
*  a bumper sticker. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=283.48s)]
*  So my case is one of many, many cases that are out there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=285.12s)]
*  And I wanted to highlight that many of our MPs and members of parliament are backpedaling [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=290.36s)]
*  now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  They're saying that, oh, no, no, no, we haven't banned silent prayer. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  And I just want to remind them that on the, I looked this up before I came on air, on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=299.44000000000005s)]
*  the 7th of March, 2023, 255 members of parliament voted against an amendment to the abortion [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=303.64s)]
*  clinic buffer zone clause to ensure that silent prayer was not made an illegal activity outside [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  of abortion clinics. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=318.52s)]
*  Amongst those 255 MPs was our Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, our Foreign Secretary, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=320.8s)]
*  David Lammy, our Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, our Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Rees, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=329.72s)]
*  and our Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, all voting to make it a crime to pray silently. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=336.16s)]
*  Our Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, didn't think it was important enough to even vote on it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  He abstained. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=348.88000000000005s)]
*  So these people really... [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=350.6s)]
*  Finish your thought. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=354.56s)]
*  Yeah, in my opinion, my humble opinion, that Britain is a country that has always stood [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=356.12s)]
*  for freedom alongside America in the Second World War and at other times. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=363.16s)]
*  If you cannot even stand up for the basic right to practice your faith in peace in this [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=368.92s)]
*  great nation, in my opinion, you do not deserve to be in government. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=374.92s)]
*  And I call upon these people to repeal this law. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=380.68s)]
*  It goes against everything that we as a nation stand for. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=384.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  I thank you, Lois, for representing Adam. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=390.6s)]
*  He's definitely deserving of that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=395.44s)]
*  And Adam, I thank you for speaking out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=397.24s)]
*  This sounds like not just an attack on free speech, but it sounds like a war on Christians, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  frankly. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=403.44s)]
*  And I just want to thank you both for joining us and sharing this message. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=404.44s)]
*  And I know you appreciate JD Vance highlighting this as well. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=408.16s)]
*  Thank you both for joining us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=411.88s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=412.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3VdGCk2acg&t=414.6s)]
