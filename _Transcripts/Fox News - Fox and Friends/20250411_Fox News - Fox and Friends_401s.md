# Bird crashes Peter Doocy's report: 'LANDED ON MY HEAD!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js)
*  And now to a Fox News alert. China escalating the ongoing trade war with the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=0.0s)]
*  raising the tariffs on US goods to 125%. Peter Deuce is live at the White House with the details. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. Good morning. They did raise the tariffs overnight, but the Chinese are putting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=12.48s)]
*  out the word now today that they are done matching the Trump US tariffs. So they got them up to 125%, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=17.12s)]
*  but the Chinese officials are telling us that they don't think it's worth matching [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=24.08s)]
*  tariff for tariff anymore with these economic sanctions that they call a joke. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=29.36s)]
*  How close are you to the first country coming to actually make a deal with the United States [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  over tariffs? Is it days, months? Well, I think it's very close, but you know, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=40.28s)]
*  we have to have a deal that we like. We don't want a deal that's going to be a bad deal or I [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=43.72s)]
*  could make every deal in one day if I wanted to. You wouldn't extend the pause? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=48.0s)]
*  We'll have to see what happens at that time. So the Chinese rate on US imports is now 125%. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=52.199999999999996s)]
*  The new US rate on Chinese imports 145% overall. That's higher than yesterday because the existing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=59.36s)]
*  20% fentanyl tariffs were left off the calculation. The president is also warning Mexico today that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=67.92s)]
*  they owe 1.3 million acres of water acres to Texas under a 1944 water treaty. He wrote, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=74.56s)]
*  my agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, is standing up for Texas farmers and we will keep [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=83.64s)]
*  escalating consequences, including tariffs and maybe even sanctions until Mexico honors the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=88.72s)]
*  treaty and gives Texas the water they are owed. And there's a great item in the Wall Street [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=93.84s)]
*  Journal today about how these negotiations, these trade deals the White House is taking on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=98.76s)]
*  typically take years each, but the White House wants to get them all done in the next several [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  weeks. We will see President Trump later on this morning when he was when he is on his way to Walter [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  Reid for his annual physical back to you. All right, Peter, will those will that information [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  be public? As much as he wants to put out, they are very they are big sticklers with HIPAA for the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  president. So as much as he wants to put out, we should get in the next couple weeks. And Peter, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=127.88s)]
*  on this trade thing, do you think it caught the administration by surprise that China could let [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=133.12s)]
*  one from 84 to over 100? No, if you talk to folks around here, they think it is the plan working. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=137.56s)]
*  They think that that is China recognizing there is a limit to how far they can go in this trade [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=144.0s)]
*  war that White House officials believe is basically the US and every other country now against China. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=150.88s)]
*  Peter, one more question. What about the water in Lawrence's state in Texas? They're saying that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=158.6s)]
*  that belongs to the US. Where is the water? What what bodies water they talking about? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=163.96s)]
*  That is a great question, Ainsley. I am learning about this on Truth Social, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=167.68s)]
*  like a lot of people this morning. And so we can get I don't want to say the wrong the wrong [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=171.92s)]
*  water, but it's 1.3 million acres. Well, we already have the Gulf of America. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=176.6s)]
*  Right. Yeah, Peter, I appreciate it. Your hair standing up now. I mean, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=180.16s)]
*  you got good hair. What's going on? That's probably so scary. Did he say dirty? Hey, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=195.6s)]
*  President Trump, if you're watching upstairs, we got to do something about these birds. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. The parks, they're always out here sweeping the street and blowing, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=211.68s)]
*  except when the birds are landing on my head. Right. Hope it didn't have the flu. That's right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, great. Yeah. Thanks. Can we get the shampoo guy down here? Right. Oh, my God. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Somebody get some 10x. All right. It had to be scary. It was like a back from a flyback as well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=232.56s)]
*  Right. You know, I think China knows exactly who they're dealing with here. I remember in 2017, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=241.2s)]
*  the president invited the president, President Xi to Mar-a-Lago to have dinner. And in the middle [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=246.68s)]
*  of that dinner, he steps away and goes in orders of strike on Syria. So he understands the toughness [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=253.08s)]
*  of Trump. He knew this was going to be a back and forth. I think eventually they'll do cave. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=260.08s)]
*  And there's going to be a deal somewhere in the middle. I don't think it's going to go zeroed out, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=264.32s)]
*  but I like the pressure that's been finally put on China. Well, I think this, I don't think they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=269.2s)]
*  flat out cave because I think there's a pride thing going on here. But the China economy, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=273.68s)]
*  it's got huge problems. It's got a property market slump right now. They're trying to dig [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  themselves out of a crisis by putting more stimulus money in. But basically, they have so much housing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=282.88s)]
*  and not enough people to fill it. They built cities and no one went. They were trying to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  generate a wealth effect, but it has not happened. 70% of their household wealth is tied to real [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  estate and the confidence in their own economy is eroding. And they've got this other thing that's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  caught them by surprise. The next generation of Chinese workers are not working. 18 to 34, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=305.24s)]
*  they're coming out of college, either refusing to or not having jobs. Now, what do you do? You [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  got to put them to work. Where are you going to go with that market? You got to go outside the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=316.28s)]
*  borders. You can't just serve the Chinese market. They're not buying. We are their number one [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=320.2s)]
*  consumers. So this is something that right away they say that they're growing at 4.5%. The GDP [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  could lose right away, 0.5%. So they've relied on our outpouring of goods and getting rid of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=331.08s)]
*  their cars, dumping all this material in all the Western countries. If we all stop buying it, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=337.08s)]
*  or it becomes cost prohibitive, they're going to find themselves in a huge crisis. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=344.84s)]
*  All right, Jameson Greer, the US Trade Representative, the one that you've seen on Capitol Hill [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  testifying in front of Congress, both houses, he is going to be on our show at 7.30. We'll ask him [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=353.56s)]
*  all these questions and maybe he'll spill the beans on what the first deal is going to be, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  because Donald Trump said we're very close to making a deal. But we have some clues. Taiwan [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=363.8s)]
*  wants to buy more of our weapons right away. They want to start working on a deal. It looks like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  Japan is addressing the tariffing already, affecting the auto and steel industry. They want to talk to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  us about that. And South Korea's government is going to provide $6.2 billion in assistance [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  for business exporting to the US. So they're trying to adjust while trying to do a deal. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=383.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyhMPY01Js&t=390.2s)]
