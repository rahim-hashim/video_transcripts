# DEA has ’been busy’ arresting criminal migrants: Special agent
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I)
*  As ICE clamps down on illegal criminal migrants across the country, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=0.0s)]
*  Borders R Tom Homan says more needs to be done. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Border numbers are down over 90% in three weeks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=8.8s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=11.6s)]
*  You know, I worked hard at it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=12.1s)]
*  You know, Kristi Nolans working hard at it and we already got over [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=14.0s)]
*  56 almost 16,000 people we arrested in the interior. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=16.5s)]
*  That's three times more than Joe Biden had a year from now, but [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=20.1s)]
*  it's not enough. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=22.8s)]
*  We got to do more. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=23.3s)]
*  This as DEA agents arrested nearly 100 migrants, including 10 of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=25.1s)]
*  Colorado's worst criminals with at least three being Tren DeRogua gang [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  members all in the past two weeks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=34.900000000000006s)]
*  DEA Rocky Mountain Field Division Special Agent in Charge, Jonathan [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=37.0s)]
*  Pullen joins us now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=42.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us, Jonathan. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=43.1s)]
*  So what is it? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=44.5s)]
*  Tell us about some of these criminals that you all rounded up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Charlie. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=49.7s)]
*  So listen, we've we've been busy the last three weeks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=50.9s)]
*  We've arrested folks from really all over the world, but primarily [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=54.5s)]
*  from Central America and South America and quite you know, we [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=58.0s)]
*  have a problem with this TDA gang here in the Denver area. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=62.1s)]
*  And so we've been targeting them for months and what you're seeing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=65.5s)]
*  on your screen is a culmination of those efforts and you know, we've [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=69.5s)]
*  been working with our counterpart agencies at Homeland Security. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=72.5s)]
*  That's ICE and HSI as well as FBI and ATF collaborating daily on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=75.69999999999999s)]
*  who we're going to target how we're going to go after them where [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=81.89999999999999s)]
*  we're going to find these guys. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=84.1s)]
*  What's the difference been for you on the ground in terms of the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  previous administration compared to the current administration in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=91.5s)]
*  terms of being able to go after some of these people? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=96.3s)]
*  Well, listen, we've always done this work. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=100.0s)]
*  DEA has always been involved in tracking down the worst offenders [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  in our cities and our states. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=105.0s)]
*  What's different is now that we have some added immigration authorities [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=107.6s)]
*  that have been granted to the Department of Justice agencies and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=111.4s)]
*  I can tell you Charlie, it's it's making a huge difference. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=115.2s)]
*  I mean you can see from the from the stats that Mr. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=117.5s)]
*  Holman was talking about, you know, just with just at DEA. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=120.9s)]
*  We've arrested almost a hundred people in the last three weeks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=124.1s)]
*  That's not including what HSI ICE and FBI in our neighborhood has [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=126.9s)]
*  done as well. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=130.0s)]
*  So that extra immigration push is essentially allowing us to take [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=131.10000000000002s)]
*  people off the streets and send them to their home countries as [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=135.5s)]
*  opposed to spending time and money investigating prosecuting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=140.4s)]
*  and incarcerating them which cost an enormous amount of money [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=144.4s)]
*  to the US government. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=147.4s)]
*  In some cases we can bypass that and they've already committed [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  a crime, entering the country illegally and they're likely [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  involved with other crimes as a lot of people on that top 10 [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=154.8s)]
*  list are and we can send them home. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  And I'm assuming that that crackdowns like the one that you've [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=159.5s)]
*  just executed probably goes to the heart of breaking up the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=162.9s)]
*  gang in a place like Colorado for good. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  That's what we're hoping for, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=172.5s)]
*  I mean some some of these people are very serious criminals, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=173.8s)]
*  right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  We're talking about major drug trafficking. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=176.5s)]
*  If you look at that list, there's a guy on the top center there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=178.9s)]
*  His name is his name is Kevin. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Kevin's a fentanyl dealer, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  He also deals in meth. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=184.0s)]
*  Kevin sold some drugs to a woman in Wyoming that ultimately [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=185.5s)]
*  killed her one-year-old baby. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=191.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=192.5s)]
*  So listen, we found out about that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  We tried to prosecute the case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of layers to it, but the case was not taken by [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=197.5s)]
*  the local DA's office. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=201.5s)]
*  So we started to investigate Kevin Moore. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=203.1s)]
*  We actually even bought more fentanyl and more meth from him [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  and then recently we were able to arrest him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=208.1s)]
*  So in a case like Kevin's, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  Where he's selling fentanyl that killed a child. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=212.1s)]
*  Now we're going to be able to take him off the streets. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=215.4s)]
*  We've already taken him off the streets. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=217.3s)]
*  He's in custody, sending back to his home country and with a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=218.6s)]
*  stronger and border, he's likely not going to be able to cross [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=221.4s)]
*  again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=224.7s)]
*  Kevin's actually crossed the border illegally several times [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=224.9s)]
*  already. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=227.8s)]
*  And what is he doing? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=228.7s)]
*  He's not he's not getting a job in construction trying to send [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=229.4s)]
*  money back to his family. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=231.8s)]
*  He's selling fentanyl and meth and he's killing Americans. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=233.3s)]
*  Keep up the good work. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=237.0s)]
*  Thank you, Jonathan. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T3FhNu2s8I&t=238.2s)]
