# ‘EXTREMELY RARE,’ Dr. Marc Siegel explains Gene Hackman’s death
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w)
*  Hey, second person has now died from the measles as the outbreak grows to nearly 230 cases in Texas and New Mexico alone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=0.0s)]
*  Our next guest spoke to HHS Secretary R.F.K. Jr. about the impact of vaccines on the spread. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=8.24s)]
*  Measles vaccines protects the community. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=16.0s)]
*  And there are people who cannot be, who should not be vaccinated in the community because they have autoimmune disease or other immune problems. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=21.84s)]
*  And if you do get vaccinated, you're protecting those people from a possible spread. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=30.4s)]
*  Fox News Senior Medical Analyst Dr. Mark Siegel joins us now. Dr. Siegel, thank you so much. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=35.84s)]
*  This is obviously a great interview you had with R.F.K. Jr. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=41.84s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. And, you know, he emphasized the need for the community to be immunized. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=46.08s)]
*  And he said that HHS is going to be sending a lot more vaccines down there, which is important because there's a shortage is in the pharmacy there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=50.96s)]
*  And, you know, you have to he also emphasized working with the individual and talking to them about it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=58.8s)]
*  I mean, and getting a higher compliance rate, because in young children in that area of Texas, it's only about 86 percent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=64.16s)]
*  And that allows measles, which is highly contagious, to spread vaccine being our absolute best tool there is a very effective vaccine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=71.44s)]
*  He also talked about the importance of having good science. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=79.44s)]
*  We need to understand the relationship between good health and chronic disease. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=83.12s)]
*  If you are healthy, it's almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=90.64s)]
*  In modern times, because we have nutrition, because we have access to medicines, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  what we need is good science on all of these things so that people can make rational choices. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=101.92s)]
*  So do we have good science about this? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=108.16s)]
*  Well, we have good science about certain things like the vaccine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  But his point about nutrition is profound. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=114.0s)]
*  I thought, Charlie, because, listen, I asked him what about the Mennonite community? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  And he said he's been talking to doctors on the ground there, and he doesn't think that they have good nutrition. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  And his point that if you have poor nutrition or poor health status, we saw during covid that people that were obese or in poor health did did poorly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=125.68s)]
*  And the same would be true for measles. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=133.84s)]
*  If you got measles and you're in poor health or were malnourished, you would more likely end up in the hospital. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=136.8s)]
*  That's where that whole vitamin A thing came up, because vitamin A deficiency is likely leads to a worse outcome with measles. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=143.12s)]
*  So it's all about being in good health and being well nourished. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=150.8s)]
*  That's his whole theme right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=153.76s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=156.32s)]
*  And, of course, bringing quite the revolution to that whole area of trying to make America healthy again, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=157.52s)]
*  which is probably the right direction to go in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=163.84s)]
*  I also want to ask you about new details that have come out in the death of Gene Hackman and his wife. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=166.32s)]
*  We find out that authorities now believe that that Mrs. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=173.6s)]
*  Hackman may have been dead for over a week before Gene Hackman himself died. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=178.56s)]
*  And it just kind of strikes me that a lot of people are affected by the issue, the illness of Alzheimer's. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=185.2s)]
*  Can you make sense of some of this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=194.56s)]
*  How does something like that happen? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=197.12s)]
*  Here's how I put it together. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  And remember, I'm going based on what the medical examiner revealed, and I didn't see the actual findings. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=201.84s)]
*  But I think what happened is hantavirus is very rare, but it's found in deer mice in that area. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=207.44s)]
*  And you can get it from the dust of droppings. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=213.36s)]
*  And there's about 20 cases a year. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=215.84s)]
*  And if you get a severe pulmonary problem, which she had, you know, it's very deadly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  It's 30 to 50 percent deadly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=222.56s)]
*  You get respiratory failure. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=224.24s)]
*  You know, she's 56. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=226.16s)]
*  He, according to the autopsy, had severe Alzheimer's, which means you're not aware of your surroundings very tragically. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  And you can't take care of yourself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=234.32s)]
*  And he had severe heart disease, so likely he wasn't even aware of what happened. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=236.24s)]
*  And after she passed, he wasn't able to take care of himself. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=240.96s)]
*  And he ended up with a heart problem or a heart attack days later and maybe wasn't even aware of what happened to her. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=244.32s)]
*  That's how I put it together. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=250.88s)]
*  That's the best way to look at the facts right now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=252.64s)]
*  More will come out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=254.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  And we know for a fact that the hantavirus is not something that is communicable from one human to another. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=256.08s)]
*  It's only obtainable from the actual deer mice droppings. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=262.88s)]
*  That's extremely important that you said that, because people will worry. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=269.52s)]
*  You're not going to get this from someone else. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's why it's so isolated number of cases. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't have a treatment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=277.36s)]
*  We don't have a vaccine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=278.24s)]
*  But it is extremely rare. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=279.28s)]
*  It's something that's endemic in rodents, not people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=281.11999999999995s)]
*  People rarely get it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=284.55999999999995s)]
*  The dog, I don't think had it, by the way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=285.76s)]
*  It doesn't get dog sick. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=287.76s)]
*  The issue with the dog was totally different. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=288.96s)]
*  Dr. Mark Siegel, thank you so much for your wisdom. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JGDRi9dP-w&t=291.35999999999996s)]
