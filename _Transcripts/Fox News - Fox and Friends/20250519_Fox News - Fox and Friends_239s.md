# 'LYING TO OUR FACEâ€™: Hosts react to shocking Biden-Hur audio
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U)
*  So it's just amazing how much that Joe Biden was has been in the news over the last few days for all the wrong reasons [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=0.0s)]
*  You have books coming out talking about how he really wasn't present and you have the people have to being asked over and over again [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=5.74s)]
*  How did you let this slip by how dare you not speak up? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=12.68s)]
*  And I think it's phenomenal [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=15.58s)]
*  It's just one thing I think to keep in mind is the story isn't why did he run again? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=17.04s)]
*  The story is how did he pull off four years where he clearly was? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=23.04s)]
*  Cognitively coming apart and maybe was coming apart as early as 20 as it was evident in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  2017 when he's running and all these people that knew it now suddenly say I never talked to him [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=35.0s)]
*  I never was with them. He was never around me [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=40.48s)]
*  But what's so interesting now is instead of the transcript coming out on him talking freely openly and without cameras around [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=43.08s)]
*  We now for the first time now that we have a new president have the Robert Herr [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=50.56s)]
*  Investigation tapes that are out so you can listen to this and you decide if President Biden should have been president [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=54.76s)]
*  My problem was I never knew where any of the documents or boxes were specifically coming from [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=67.2s)]
*  This is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=81.0s)]
*  This stage in 2009 so [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=84.4s)]
*  And of course this was the interview with the FBI or its special counsel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=89.0s)]
*  regarding the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=94.2s)]
*  Documents case and of course at the time when this this audio was made [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  The the the Biden team Democrats fought tooth and nail to keep us from hearing the audio [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=100.44s)]
*  And we only ended up getting the transcript from which they altered and which they altered and I mean if you if you looked [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  If you do a side-by-side of the transcript that we were given with a transcript of what we now know based off of this audio [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=114.0s)]
*  It's it's amazing how different it is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  But now we know why they were working so hard to keep us from hearing the audio tape and he interviewed him [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=125.32s)]
*  Robert Herr interviewed President Biden October 2023. This was a year before the election. It was [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=131.44s)]
*  During the time of October 7th [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=137.6s)]
*  While the attacks right right and then we received the report last March and Robert Herr said sympathetic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory and you can hear in those sound bites and there are a lot of clips that have come [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=146.68s)]
*  out [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=152.26s)]
*  Where he can't remember things can't remember dates and now people writing these books are saying he was forgetting [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=153.28s)]
*  Some of his staffers names people he was very good friends with he forgot George Clooney [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=159.68s)]
*  Who he'd been friends with for 20 years had fluorescent tape on the floor so that he could see where to walk and where to go [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  He's calling Jake Sullivan [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Steve [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=171.68s)]
*  Repeatedly so put it this way if you're doing all these things giving these cards with great detail like walk in the room [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Sit in the open chair, you know, how bad he is, you know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=178.68s)]
*  How bad he is and how does James Clyburn not know how bad he is? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=182.32s)]
*  How does Chris Koon sign a whole bet he is so they were so comfortable lying to our face putting our country in jeopardy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  and you're seeing some of the catastrophic decisions and some of the legislation that would that just buried us in debt and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=193.04s)]
*  Curried a covered us in shame with Afghanistan and then you think to yourself [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=200.0s)]
*  Why would you believe anything they say if they lied to your face for four years and don't tell me you were surprised [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=204.64s)]
*  And don't tell me you never talked to him because you talked to him you had these fundraisers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=210.0s)]
*  All of them and just don't get caught up in the reelection talk [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=214.56s)]
*  The question is how did he win election and when he got there? How did he keep the job? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  And fundamentally they're gonna say we thought a diminished Biden was better than Kamala Harris. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0woKpYu0U&t=222.84s)]
