# This is the 'biggest problem' facing Mayor Adams: Turley
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw)
*  Fox News alert exactly 6 30 here in New York City. Just a couple of hours. New [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=0.0s)]
*  York City's current mayor, Eric Adams, will be arraigned in court on bribery [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  and campaign charges. He is accused of accepting upwards of $100,000 in ritzy [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=9.36s)]
*  hotel rooms like these, along with first class flights and lavish gifts in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=15.48s)]
*  return for favors to Turkish leaders. But Mr Adams is arguing it has more to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=20.22s)]
*  weaponized Department of Justice after comments he has made like these over the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=26.5s)]
*  years. They watched me navigate 52,000 people coming into our city without one [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=32.260000000000005s)]
*  penny from the federal government. The president and the White House has failed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=39.54s)]
*  New York City on this issue. Why isn't every elected official in Washington, D. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=44.46s)]
*  C. Asking the national government? Why are you doing this? Why are they doing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=50.22s)]
*  this? George Washington University Professor Jonathan Turley joins us [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=57.22s)]
*  right now from the D. C. Area. Jonathan, good morning to you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=61.62s)]
*  Thank you, Steve. Okay, so when it was first announced that he was gonna be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=65.62s)]
*  indicted, that's what he started saying. Hey, it's because I complained about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration and migrants. Well, now we're taking a look at some [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=73.82s)]
*  of the stuff, and there's not a lot of there there. And you just wrote a great [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=78.38s)]
*  op ed, which essentially says, you know, in the rush to judgment with those [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=82.69999999999999s)]
*  headlines, bribery, corruption, stuff like that, there's not much there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  That's right. There's certainly less than meets the eye. Once you begin to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=92.58s)]
*  look at these, uh, these charges, you know, they, for example, say that there [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=95.38s)]
*  was a quid pro quo where the mayor intervened to speed along a fire [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=100.66s)]
*  inspection approval process for a Turkish consulate. But the mayor can [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=104.94s)]
*  say, Look, that's what mayors do. You know, this is a city with a lot of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=111.02s)]
*  diplomats, and we want to avoid diplomatic problems, including the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=113.98s)]
*  arrival of the president of that country. So he has defenses to say there [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=118.06s)]
*  wasn't any quid pro quo here. The most damaging is probably the allegations of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=123.06s)]
*  solicitation of foreign contributions. But we have to see how much knowledge [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=128.1s)]
*  he had that $100,000 are largely upgrades and hotels, which certainly don't [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=132.73999999999998s)]
*  make him look good. But, you know, I think Steve, the biggest problem he's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=138.94s)]
*  gonna have is that the U. S. Attorney's Office was very aggressive yesterday [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  and basically warned people around him. We will be indicting others, so you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  better cooperate. And they're trying to build a case with his associates [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  because they know that those witnesses are very damaging in front of a jury. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=156.22s)]
*  It was kind of crazy. Apparently they took his phone and he they said, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=160.58s)]
*  unlock it for us. And he said, You know, I changed the password yesterday and I [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=166.66s)]
*  forgot it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=171.06s)]
*  Do the fence by that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=172.88s)]
*  No. And the it's clear that they believe that he was obstructing efforts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=176.58s)]
*  He's not charged with that. But there, you know, the biggest one of the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  problems that people like Adams have is that jurors don't take kindly to these [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=186.9s)]
*  luxury suites, upgrades to business class. But the government still has to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  stick the landing on that one. They've got to show that that Adams knew where [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  these upgrades were coming from. Some people like Adams might not know. Okay, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=201.74s)]
*  one of the thing we want to know about apparently, you know, a three panel of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  judges taking a look at these in the appeal judges, looking at Judge [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  anger on civil fraud case against Donald Trump, where he is ordered to pay [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=215.22s)]
*  about a half a billion dollars. It sounds like yesterday the defense had a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=219.46s)]
*  better job, had a better day than the prosecution. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=225.38s)]
*  Well, certainly New York had a better shot with the Cowboys because this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=231.32s)]
*  this panel expressed real problems. You know, one of them, Justice Friedman, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=235.5s)]
*  said this law supposed to protect the market and the consumers. I don't see it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  here. And he really pointed out how it brought out how grotesque this penalty [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=244.98s)]
*  has been by this judge and how it's growing every day. All right, Jonathan [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=250.7s)]
*  Turley, Jonathan, have a nice weekend, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=255.62s)]
*  Steve. Just rub in that Giants lost way to go. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j09pxigKiQw&t=259.58s)]
