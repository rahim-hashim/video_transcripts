# Lara Trump: Democrats are ‘on their heels’ #foxnews #news #shorts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w)
*  Trump 2.0, kind of the second administration, is different than the first. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think there was so much learned by my father-in-law during his first term in office. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=4.88s)]
*  And certainly over the past four years, watching how many of our freedoms were truly eroded [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=9.4s)]
*  in this country, watching really the destruction in so many ways of America. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  And he really sat back and he looked and he planned what he would do in this moment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=17.68s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=22.16s)]
*  I haven't seen a second of him on defense, or quite frankly, the Republican Party on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=23.16s)]
*  defense. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=27.44s)]
*  He felt like full offense from President Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=28.48s)]
*  He is not bogged down by the media like he was during the first term in office. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  The Democrats are on their heels. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  They cannot get a footing anywhere. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=37.44s)]
*  And he's full seam ahead for America. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIVp4Kx7u5w&t=39.620000000000005s)]
