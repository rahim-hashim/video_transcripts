# What Trump tapping Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary means for the US economy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko)
*  President-elect Trump making a crucial cabinet choice, nominating Scott Bessent as his new Treasury Secretary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=0.0s)]
*  If confirmed, Bessent has a tough job ahead of him as U.S. national debt surpassed $36 trillion for the first time in the nation's history. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=7.0s)]
*  Former Assistant Treasury Secretary Monica Crowley is a personal friend of Bessent. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=17.0s)]
*  She joins us now. Monica, it's great to see you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=21.0s)]
*  So, this is a pick we've been waiting for. Treasury. It's our money. It's a big deal. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=24.0s)]
*  You served in Treasury for two years under Trump. You know Scott Bessent personally. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=29.0s)]
*  What do you think he's going to do? What's his priority as the Treasury Secretary? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=34.0s)]
*  Well, good morning to you, Brian. And I cannot be more thrilled to see my friend Scott Bessent appointed by President Trump to be Treasury Secretary. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=40.0s)]
*  Scott is absolutely brilliant. He knows capital markets better than anybody. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=48.0s)]
*  And he's also fully supportive of President Trump's pro-growth economic agenda, as well as his tariff and trade agenda, which was a critical element in his selection. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=53.0s)]
*  He's been a top adviser to President Trump on economics now for quite a while. The president likes him. He trusts him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=64.0s)]
*  He has full confidence in him to be an outstanding steward of the U.S. economy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=71.0s)]
*  So remember, Brian, President Trump brought the U.S. economy back not once, but twice. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=76.0s)]
*  First, after eight long years of Obama-Biden, and then second, when we began to reopen after the unprecedented economic shutdowns of COVID. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=81.0s)]
*  And now with Scott Bessent by his side, President Trump is going to restore the U.S. economy to strength and growth a third time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=91.0s)]
*  Well, one of the things he's going to have to deal with, and you know this better than anybody, is the national debt. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=99.0s)]
*  Thirty-six trillion dollars. You know, he's got Elon Musk. He's got Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=104.0s)]
*  How does Scott Bessent fit into the story of getting that debt under control? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=110.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we certainly are in a debt crisis right now. And you're right. Thirty-six trillion dollars in national debt. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=117.0s)]
*  But we're also running annual deficits of about two trillion dollars because of out-of-control spending. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=123.0s)]
*  So there's going to be a two-track approach to this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=130.0s)]
*  Brian, first is going to be economic growth, which President Trump delivered once before through a pro-growth economic strategy of tax cuts, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=134.0s)]
*  regulatory relief, unleashing our great energy sector and fairer trade deals. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=143.0s)]
*  So all of those things are going to kick in, as well as his new and creative policies of no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=149.0s)]
*  no tax on Social Security benefits and other elements of this pro-growth economic approach. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=156.0s)]
*  But the other track is going to be cutting government and reining in the size of government. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=163.0s)]
*  So he will have Doge with Elon and Vivek working on that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=169.0s)]
*  But he's also going to have somebody named Russ Vought at the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=174.0s)]
*  Russ was his OMB director in his first term. That is where most of the cost cutting is going to come through OMB. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=180.0s)]
*  And as the president says, reining in the deep state. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=188.0s)]
*  There is nobody better than Russ Vought to work hand in glove with Scott Bessent at Treasury and Howard Letnick at Commerce on the trade agenda, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=191.0s)]
*  but also reining in the size of government. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah, Russ Vought at OMB is kind of the Doge guy on the inside, if you will. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=202.0s)]
*  But I want to ask you really quickly, you mentioned tariffs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=207.0s)]
*  You know, the left is going after President Trump on tariffs, saying it's going to be a national sales tax. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=210.0s)]
*  But Scott Bessent has talked about it as well. And he says it's a negotiating tool. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=215.0s)]
*  How do you expect that whole thing to play out? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, tariffs have three parts to it, all beneficial to the U.S. economy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=223.0s)]
*  Number one, they can be a substantial revenue stream into Treasury. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=228.0s)]
*  Number two, it's all about protecting the American worker. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=233.0s)]
*  And three, as leverage, which President Trump demonstrated in his first term. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=237.0s)]
*  He used tariffs to great effect to bring the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese leadership to the table, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=242.0s)]
*  as well as Mexico to agree to the remain in Mexico policy and enforce their side of the border. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=248.0s)]
*  So tariffs have tremendous power in terms of actual economic as an economic tool, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=255.0s)]
*  but also as leverage to bring our trading partners to the table to strike fair trade deals for the American worker. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=261.0s)]
*  If you want to get a deal, you got to get people to the table. And tariffs are one way to do that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=269.0s)]
*  Monica Crowley, great to see you. Thanks for being with us today. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=274.0s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKh6TAFieko&t=285.0s)]
