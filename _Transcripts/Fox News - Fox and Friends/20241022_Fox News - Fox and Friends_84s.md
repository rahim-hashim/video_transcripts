# Trump vows to ban biological men from women's sports
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc)
*  Some of the fellas are concerned about what's happening in the schools. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=2.84s)]
*  And they want a parent. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=3.34s)]
*  They don't want all this nonsense being talked to their children. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=4.48s)]
*  You're not into transgender, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=7.8s)]
*  And... [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=9.36s)]
*  You don't want your boy going to school. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=10.28s)]
*  So what are you gonna do about that? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=12.24s)]
*  We're gonna end it. It ends immediately. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=13.56s)]
*  And you're not gonna have men playing in women's sports if you have a daughter. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=15.84s)]
*  I mean, it's so crazy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  My daughter's a state... [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=21.56s)]
*  She's a state and national wrestler champion. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=22.64s)]
*  But she doesn't want to wrestle a man, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=25.88s)]
*  In New York, they have yet to segregate. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=28.08s)]
*  In the high schools, they have yet to segregate male and female in wrestling. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=30.04s)]
*  So she was wrestling against boys. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=33.48s)]
*  She's very good? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  She was good. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=36.6s)]
*  So let me ask you, how would she have done against an average man? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=37.6s)]
*  Who? Her? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=40.72s)]
*  Your daughter, yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  She wrestled a man. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=42.4s)]
*  I've seen a pin young men in high school. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=43.8s)]
*  So, and once again... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=47.36s)]
*  You don't want to break up with her in the sports. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=48.44s)]
*  Good line. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=53.56s)]
*  That just says a huge problem. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=54.56s)]
*  Like, boys are told, you know, you treat girls with respect, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  and all of a sudden, you're in a singlet, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=59.44s)]
*  and you're wrestling them at the 136 pounds. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=61.04s)]
*  So they broke it up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=63.64s)]
*  And now there's women's wrestling. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=64.88s)]
*  They should absolutely separate on boxing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=66.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we saw that with the Olympics. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=69.16s)]
*  You're gonna get someone with a concussion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=70.88s)]
*  It's just a safety concern. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g4RKN_jbc&t=72.36s)]
