# Milton 'packed a punch': Florida lieutenant governor gives update on aftermath
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI)
*  All right, meanwhile, for a lieutenant governor, Jeanette Nunes joins us now from Miami with an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=0.0s)]
*  update. Lieutenant Governor, we were kind of surprised to see damage in Miami. Did it catch [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=4.64s)]
*  you by surprise? No, actually, we had seen that this was going to be a far-reaching storm, which [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=9.76s)]
*  is why the governor and his emergency order had 51 of our 67 counties included, especially those [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  that are far away from where the direct impact was supposed to be. And so the tornadoes really were [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=22.0s)]
*  something of concern for us yesterday, all throughout yesterday. We were encouraging [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=27.6s)]
*  people to stay safe, to stay indoors. But as you saw, we're waking up this morning to all [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=31.6s)]
*  the devastation and all the damage. Hurricane Milton indeed packed a punch, but Florida is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  ready under the leadership of Governor DeSantis, and we're going to continue to help people rebuild. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=41.2s)]
*  As we look at some of the damage right there, Lieutenant Governor, you know, one of the problems [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=45.6s)]
*  for Floridians is insurance. You can get flood insurance through the federal government, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  for the most part. But the problem is these days, there are a lot of insurance companies that no [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  longer write hurricane insurance. If you can get it, it is super expensive. It's like quadrupled [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  in the last 10 years. For people who are looking at the damage there and they're thinking, you know, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=67.92s)]
*  should I be insured? What's the message? Well, certainly we want to contend with the issue, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=74.0s)]
*  and that's why under the governor's leadership, we worked with the legislature. We did a tremendous [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  amount of legal reform, but then we've also stabilized the market. So we've seen about nine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=85.04s)]
*  companies come into Florida. They are now writing policies that's created competition. We are far [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=90.0s)]
*  from where we'd like to be, but I'll tell you, this is both a wind and a water event, and we [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  saw multiple areas of the state really being impacted. So we're going to continue to work [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=101.68s)]
*  to make sure people can afford, they can rebuild, and we're going to do everything we can to assist. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=106.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Governor, what about the fatalities? I know that the sheriff of Saint Lucie County said [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=111.84s)]
*  that there were fatalities in the manufacturing homes in Spanish Lakes Country Club, which is in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=117.2s)]
*  Fort Pierce. He thinks about four people died there. Any other fatalities? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so we're still assessing that. I know the governor will be doing a press conference soon, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  so he'll probably announce if there have been additional fatalities. But what I'll tell you, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Ainsley, is a lot of times tragically the fatalities occur after the storm when people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=137.68s)]
*  start using generators inside their home. They get up on ladders, they drive through flooded water. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=142.64s)]
*  So we're encouraging people to really be careful in the ensuing days because many times that happens [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=147.28s)]
*  after, well after the storm has left. So Lieutenant Governor, it's not quite time yet for people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=152.88s)]
*  to leave the shelters, right? Everybody should still be shelter in place. Yeah, absolutely. We [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=158.24s)]
*  want people to stay where they are. Of course, we want people to get back to their homes and be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=164.24s)]
*  able to assess their damage and start cleaning up. But that needs to be done in a timely manner. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=168.24s)]
*  There's still emergency responders out there, national guardsmen, our search and rescue teams [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=172.72s)]
*  are still responding. So we want people to, of course, to be safe, allow the linemen the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  opportunity to start restoring power. We have about three million Floridians right now that do [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=182.24s)]
*  not have power. So we hope to get that back on quickly. Nobody does it better than Governor [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=187.28s)]
*  DeSantis. So again, I think people should just stay home and be safe. 55,000 went to shelters, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=191.6s)]
*  six of the 17 are totally full. That's the numbers I have. But you're also looking to get some gas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=196.96s)]
*  A quarter of the gas stations are out of fuel. So I guess that'll be a focus as soon as the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  roads are clear. Lieutenant Governor, thanks so much. Thank you so much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuX385_CWI&t=207.44s)]
