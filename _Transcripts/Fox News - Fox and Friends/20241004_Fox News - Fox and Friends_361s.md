# OVERNIGHT: Israel targets Hezbollah's possible new leader
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw)
*  Now to a Fox News alert. You are looking live at Beirut. Let's look together. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=0.0s)]
*  After the Israeli airstrikes continue their air campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=4.82s)]
*  Specific sites, it seems, from intelligence gained on the ground. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=10.52s)]
*  The IDF's overnight strikes reportedly targeting Hezbollah's possible successor to terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah, a cousin of his. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=13.72s)]
*  Here to react is on the latest in real time, General Jack Keane. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=21.56s)]
*  General, judging by those attacks, it's clear the intelligence is still strong amongst the IDF, correct? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=25.98s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. I mean, what's going on in Lebanon with Hezbollah? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=32.98s)]
*  They have three things they're doing. One is they're dismantling systematically their leadership. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  And we've seen the evidence of that clearly for the last three weeks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=45.9s)]
*  And here is the so-called successor hasn't been announced yet. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=50.42s)]
*  Hassan Sufidine, as you said, he's the cousin in Israel. He is a founder of Hezbollah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  He goes all the way back to 1982. His son is married to Qasem Soleimani's daughter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=60.82s)]
*  He has been embedded in this for years and is very close to Iran and the supreme leader. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=66.86s)]
*  They're going to keep doing this. They've taken out their senior leaders. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=73.98s)]
*  They've taken down operational leaders like the rocket and missile commander. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=77.54s)]
*  And they've killed a number of their tactical leaders because the second mission they're going after in Lebanon is the rocket and missile force. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  We can only speculate, but about a week and a half ago, I was told by Israelis they had taken down about 30 percent of the rocket and missile force. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  I suspect they're probably close to 50 percent by now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  And clearly that is really what they're after, because that's the weapon that can hurt them inside Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=103.54s)]
*  Then the third thing, Brian, is the ground campaign that's taken place. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=109.38s)]
*  They're attacking on two axes. What they're trying to do is eliminate the threat at the border, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=114.1s)]
*  the rocket and missile threat at the border and the potential for an invasion like Hamas did on October the 7th. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=119.82s)]
*  They've got paratroopers, commandos and armor forces involved in that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=127.1s)]
*  They're working on two axes. They've committed a division to it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=131.22s)]
*  They've got two other divisions in standby, which will likely get committed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=134.38s)]
*  It'll take a number of weeks for them to accomplish this mission. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=138.94s)]
*  Wow. So now let's talk Iran. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=142.62s)]
*  So 180 rockets, missiles into Israel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=145.9s)]
*  It's time for a response. They promise a harsh response. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=150.26s)]
*  They're coordinating with with the U.S. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=153.62s)]
*  Here is what President Biden recommended when asked. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=156.66s)]
*  Do you support Israel's right to Iran's oil facilities, sir? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=161.66s)]
*  We're in discussion. I think I think that would be a little anyway. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  What are the plans to allow Israel to strike back against Iran? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=171.38s)]
*  First of all, we don't allow Israel. We advise Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=175.34s)]
*  And there's nothing going to happen today. We'll talk about that later. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm just why he never talks to the press, but he says don't hit the nuclear sites. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=183.34s)]
*  We're considering hit the oil sites and nothing's happening today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=187.94s)]
*  General, what's what's he thinking? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=191.06s)]
*  Well, that's outrageous that we talk in a public forum like that, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  you know, that he's trying to take nuclear attack sites off the table, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  which obviously gives the Iranians, you know, they can balance [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=204.78s)]
*  what they're going to defend based on that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  And there's still some risk involved because Netanyahu could do it anyway. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=211.62s)]
*  But why play into the Iranians hands? But we've seen this before. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=215.7s)]
*  I mean, the micromanaging their operation in Gaza. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=218.94s)]
*  Who did that help? That helped Hamas. And here we are helping Iranians. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=223.54s)]
*  So our audience understands. I believe and so does the Israelis, who I talk to. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=228.18s)]
*  They certainly believe that Iran is vulnerable. And why is that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=234.86s)]
*  And they're somewhat back on their heels. Well, there are two major proxies [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=239.98s)]
*  where they make all their investment are being systematically dismantled. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=244.54s)]
*  The military effectiveness of Hamas is dramatically reduced. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=249.94s)]
*  And you can see what's happening in Hezbollah. And we just talked about it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=254.46s)]
*  That is a big deal. And what Netanyahu is going for here, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=257.98s)]
*  he's not going for a stop the fighting. He's going for the win. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=263.42s)]
*  And that, I think, is what he should be pursuing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=268.3s)]
*  The second thing is, is that Iran's conventional force is overwhelmingly weak. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=271.38s)]
*  The rocket and missile force is the strongest part of their conventional force. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=277.02000000000004s)]
*  But look at two major attacks and they've had difficulty having any consequential [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=281.70000000000005s)]
*  results from those two major attacks using rockets and missiles into Israel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=287.22s)]
*  And the third thing is the overwhelming majority of the Iranian people are so [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=293.3s)]
*  fed up with this regime. They've been living with it for 40 something years. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=300.82s)]
*  They have nothing to show for it. They're continually oppressed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=304.94s)]
*  They can't speak out. Human rights are being denied on a regular basis every day. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=308.06s)]
*  It doesn't take much to spark this thing. And Netanyahu and his team knows it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=313.98s)]
*  I think that's why they want to hurt Iran, make them weaker as a result of it, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=319.18s)]
*  and create, not overnight, but create a spark and a foundation for an eventual [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=324.18s)]
*  significant civil unrest as a result of it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=331.02s)]
*  And we all know the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, others are clapping about this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=334.5s)]
*  because they despise Iran too. And their silence says a lot. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  Thanks so much, General. This is a historic time. Thanks to Israel's prowess. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=342.62s)]
*  This is an opportunity to destroy our enemy too. General Jack Keane, thanks so much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCIa0n_jtw&t=346.41999999999996s)]
