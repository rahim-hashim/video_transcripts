*  And it's only gonna be better from there the feelings everywhere and the things he said that he's gonna get done is just [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=65.4s)]
*  You know the excitement, especially if you're on our side, it's to the roof [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=71.88s)]
*  But I think people all reasonable people right I feel you know our understanding just like if we would have got a reasonable Democrat [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=74.88s)]
*  Like it's okay. Like we we think differently on a lot of things [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=82.72s)]
*  But if you're a reasonable person, I really got a stress reasonable because Lord knows there's some fruitcakes out there [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=85.88s)]

*  and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=118.38s)]
*  Something old something new [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=119.98s)]
*  Good now we had we had heard we talked about this on [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=122.1s)]
*  Fox and Friends on Friday where I said, you know, it sounds like [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=126.18s)]
*  You had to run the plans by the Secret Service and they said no fireworks and no girls on polls [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=130.02s)]
*  And then your phone started ringing and who was it? Yeah Friday morning I [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=136.3s)]
*  Got a call from the president and Melania and uh [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=142.42s)]
*  It's kind of mind-blowing. I've tried to leave him alone. I got a lot on his plate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  I would think right now and to find the time to call and shoot the junk with me [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=151.42s)]
*  But yeah, he got a call to go to the Secret Service really tell you you can't use strippers [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=156.3s)]
*  I [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=161.0s)]
*  Know sir, I was just joking around it was funny [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=163.64s)]
*  He's so fun he's so fun so how do you explain [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=168.32s)]
*  The the different perception that people have of I mean was so much different in 2017 [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=173.04s)]
*  Well, I think it you know [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=181.56s)]
*  It made it pretty easy, you know watching Joe Biden and that administration for four years to say like wow [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=183.88s)]
*  You know to take a look back at the previous four years and go, okay [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  This is not apples to oranges here. This is you know, wow [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=194.28s)]
*  So the previous look how good we had it right, you know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=197.16s)]
*  And I think he's just you know, I can't stress you my parents instilled me [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=200.32s)]
*  Especially my father just you know the values of common sense, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=203.24s)]
*  And that's been a big talking point on the campaign trail and really in everything he's done [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  I've seen is just exercising common sense and the one thing I will employ that he asked so many people [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=211.06s)]
*  Just regular people like you know, right he called me up, you know, yeah, we joked a little bit [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=217.92s)]
*  But he also you know was talking to me had seen my Fox thing from from Jesse and we talked about that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=222.32s)]
*  Let me goes he goes let me ask you question goes he goes, you know people could could really have a bad experience [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  Maybe some people could could get hurt our first responders. What do you think about me moving the uh, the inauguration indoors and I'm like [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=232.04s)]
*  You [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=239.84s)]
*  Before you go Bobby tell us a little bit about your tours because yeah a whole bunch of places love to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW1tkSqHEM&t=244.28s)]
