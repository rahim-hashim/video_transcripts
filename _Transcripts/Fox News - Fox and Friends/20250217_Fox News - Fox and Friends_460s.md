# Dems melt down over Mayor Adams as Trump's DOJ drops charges: 'Political pawn'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY)
*  The other story in the news right now is Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=0.0s)]
*  And apparently there is a meltdown over him working [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=4.32s)]
*  with the Trump administration, something that he tried to do [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=8.94s)]
*  with the Biden administration about getting the legals [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=10.94s)]
*  that are criminals, we're just talking [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=14.16s)]
*  about criminals right now, out of the country, arrested. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=16.28s)]
*  But they're saying that this was a deal made in private, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=20.32s)]
*  so he didn't have to face charges. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=23.92s)]
*  Let's watch the freak out. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  This is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=28.38s)]
*  It is an outright extortion. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=34.82s)]
*  They have literally taken the mayor of New York City [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=37.18s)]
*  and they have turned him into their own political pawn. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=39.9s)]
*  So as you look over what happened last week, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=43.86s)]
*  a week ago we were on the couch, we didn't see until later [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=47.42s)]
*  in the day or Tuesday that the Department of Justice, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=50.22s)]
*  the acting Deputy Attorney General told the Department [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=53.26s)]
*  of Justice to drop the charges. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=58.78s)]
*  And then five, six, seven, eight people from the DOJ [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=60.26s)]
*  and the U.S. Attorney acting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=63.9s)]
*  for the Southern District of New York, they all resigned. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=66.18s)]
*  They said, you are asking us to essentially do your dirty [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=68.38s)]
*  work because what they have suggested [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=72.78s)]
*  and what they wrote was drop the charges [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=74.7s)]
*  because we need Eric Adams to help us [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=77.56s)]
*  with the migration problem in New York City. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=80.7s)]
*  And also there's an election coming up [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=83.74s)]
*  and it would be disruptive. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=85.66s)]
*  So next thing you know, he announces that they're gonna [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=87.5s)]
*  reopen the ICE office at Rikers and people are going, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=91.66s)]
*  okay, so what happened here was behind the scenes, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=95.78s)]
*  he said, okay, I will help you with the migration problem [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=99.46s)]
*  in New York, but you've got to drop the charges. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=103.62s)]
*  That's what they are saying. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=106.42s)]
*  He was actually on this couch sitting right [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=107.58s)]
*  where you were Lawrence on Friday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=109.9s)]
*  And he said, it was not quid pro quo, watch. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  Think about my attorney, Alex Spira, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  one of the top trial attorneys in the country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=118.5s)]
*  Imagine him going inside saying that the only way [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  Mayor Adams is going to assist in immigration, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=129.02s)]
*  which I was calling for since 2022, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=132.1s)]
*  is if you drop the charges. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  That's quid pro quo, that's a crime. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=136.08s)]
*  It took her three weeks to report in front of her [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=137.66s)]
*  a criminal action, come on, this is silly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=142.46s)]
*  You know, that makes a lot of sense to me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=145.74s)]
*  What doesn't make sense is Amy Klobuchar, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=147.26s)]
*  who we just played, and she went on to say [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=149.54s)]
*  that he's a political pawn, Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=152.1s)]
*  And I'm sitting there thinking to myself, okay, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=154.86s)]
*  it is a plenary power of the federal government [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=157.22s)]
*  to control immigration. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=159.62s)]
*  That means they have sole control pretty much [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=160.62s)]
*  over immigration and nationality. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=163.38s)]
*  We have the Immigration and Nationality Act, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=164.86s)]
*  it's a lot of pages. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=166.42s)]
*  So for him to work with the federal government [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=167.78s)]
*  as a mayor on an issue that is in the power [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  of the federal government makes him a political pawn? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  No, I think that makes him someone abiding [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  by the constitutional order that our founders intended. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=177.54s)]
*  And you know, what I love is the plain speaking [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=180.42s)]
*  of Tom Homan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  Tom Homan was pushed on this like six or seven times [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=183.94s)]
*  on CNN, but here's no nonsense, Tom Homan, listen to this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=186.98s)]
*  I think, I think it was probably eight, nine, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  weeks ago we met and we had the same discussion. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=195.38s)]
*  And we talked about getting a presence in Rikers Island. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=197.74s)]
*  We talked about how we can collaborate [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=200.22s)]
*  on public safety threats and finding the missing children [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=202.5s)]
*  that were, that can be found after they release [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  the sponsors. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=208.34s)]
*  And we had that a couple months ago, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=209.18s)]
*  a while long before this other discussion. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=210.62s)]
*  So I don't think I had anything to do with it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=212.0s)]
*  Matter of fact, the meeting was very well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=213.78s)]
*  It was the same meeting we had a few weeks ago. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=216.26s)]
*  I guess my real issue, look, I know pundits [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=218.82s)]
*  and people in the media are gonna speak [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=222.38s)]
*  about the deal or whatever. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=224.74s)]
*  Where do you think the American people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  gonna stand on this issue right here? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=228.22s)]
*  The mayor that's helping the administration [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=230.0s)]
*  get rid of the criminals. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=232.06s)]
*  There were people in the Bronx, New York, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=233.5s)]
*  it's not like just a white neighborhood. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  Those are immigrants, those are many black Latino folks [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=238.04s)]
*  cheering Tom Homan as well as the DHS secretary [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=241.98s)]
*  as they were getting the criminals out [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=246.1s)]
*  of their neighborhood. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=248.22s)]
*  And so it's just another common sense issue right here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=249.38s)]
*  I know you guys wanna talk about targeting [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  political opponents and what deal, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=253.84s)]
*  but the American people, they only think about the reality. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=255.6s)]
*  In their community, they feel unsafe [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=258.52s)]
*  because there's criminal aliens [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=260.4s)]
*  that are within their communities. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=261.88s)]
*  And a mayor that's fighting with this administration [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=263.28s)]
*  to get that resolved, they're gonna cheer that on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=265.84s)]
*  Well, you know, and when he was here, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  he said, look, because we said, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  why are you suddenly working with ICE? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=274.56s)]
*  And he goes, well, I worked with them before. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=277.08s)]
*  And it's like, no, you didn't. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=278.82s)]
*  And he said, well, I went as far as I could, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=279.84s)]
*  as far as the law would allow me to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  because we're in a sanctuary city here in New York City. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=284.76s)]
*  And so his hands were tied. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=288.11999999999995s)]
*  The thing about him, and we don't know [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  what went on behind the scenes, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=291.56s)]
*  but we do know that apparently right after Trump was elected [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  and it was clear that he was gonna be [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  the new sheriff in town, Eric Adams' lawyers, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  according to the New York Times, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=303.55999999999995s)]
*  went and talked to Trump's lawyers at the White House [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=304.76s)]
*  and said, hey, listen, he wants a pardon. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=308.32s)]
*  And so nothing was decided. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  About a week or so later, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=314.82s)]
*  officials from the White House called and said, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=316.68s)]
*  hey, we'd like to talk about dropping the charges. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=318.36s)]
*  We don't know what those conversations were like, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=320.86s)]
*  but people are connecting the dots. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=324.68s)]
*  Ultimately, what it comes down to is they need cooperation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  Maybe Eric Adams realized, you know what? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=332.52s)]
*  I've been messing it up. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=334.68s)]
*  I should have helped ICE before. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=336.36s)]
*  This town would be less dangerous. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=338.12s)]
*  And now he says that he's gonna do more. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=341.48s)]
*  Maybe, and you know, let me connect some dots. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  Maybe, just maybe, the wake-up call for Mayor Eric Adams [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=346.20000000000005s)]
*  was Jose Ibarra being arrested in the city [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  on child endangerment charges, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=352.12s)]
*  let out, housed on the Roosevelt Hotel, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=353.68s)]
*  on our taxpayer dime, and then he gets a humanitarian flight [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=356.12s)]
*  on our dime to go kill Lake and Riley in Georgia. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=358.6s)]
*  Maybe that was the wake-up call. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=361.44000000000005s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't a meeting. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=363.06s)]
*  So you can connect the dots all you want, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=364.12s)]
*  but the dots I'm connecting are what you said, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=367.0s)]
*  the heinous reality on the ground for New Yorkers [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  when it comes to immigration. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=370.76s)]
*  And legally speaking, and you know this as an attorney, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=371.76s)]
*  I don't understand some of the reporting on this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=376.24s)]
*  because the mayor never needed a pardon. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  This is something I said months on the couch before. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=380.64s)]
*  The charges had been brought, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=383.52s)]
*  but it had never been adjudicated yet. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=386.0s)]
*  And so the reporting that says that he was seeking [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  a pardon in the White House, he didn't need it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=391.2s)]
*  He just needed the charges to be dropped [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=393.86s)]
*  before he even went to trial. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=395.5s)]
*  So again, this is gonna play out for the public to see. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=397.74s)]
*  I still contend that the American people [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=400.62s)]
*  want the criminals out of the country right now. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=402.18s)]
*  And that's the story that we're gonna be focusing on. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, here's ultimately where he stands, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=406.82s)]
*  and that is the fact that, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=410.86s)]
*  given the fact that the predicates [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=413.5s)]
*  for dismissing the cases were, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=415.5s)]
*  he's gotta help us with the migration problem [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=417.46s)]
*  here in New York City. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=420.0s)]
*  And it makes his election complicated. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=421.02s)]
*  They didn't base it on whether or not he was innocent, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  but they did say we can refile charges after the election, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  and that's in June. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=434.26s)]
*  And you've gotta figure if he does not deliver [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=435.7s)]
*  helping with the migration problem, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=440.06s)]
*  there's a real good possibility that could happen. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=442.12s)]
*  You know how it works. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=444.82s)]
*  It could, it's not over until the fat lady sings [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  or until DOJ speaks, I guess. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNZ--U1rKY&t=448.46s)]
