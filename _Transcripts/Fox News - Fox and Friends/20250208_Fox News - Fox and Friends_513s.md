# Whistleblowers rip 'career bureaucrats' at USAID
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw)
*  Overnight, we've got some news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=0.0s)]
*  A federal judge issuing an order temporarily blocking [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=1.36s)]
*  Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=4.12s)]
*  from accessing the Treasury Department's payment systems. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=7.24s)]
*  Now this comes after 19 attorneys general filed suit [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=10.64s)]
*  accusing the administration of breaking federal law [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=14.32s)]
*  by giving DOGE access to federal computer systems [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=16.88s)]
*  that include sensitive personal data. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=19.88s)]
*  And another judge is temporarily blocking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=22.44s)]
*  President Trump's order, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=24.76s)]
*  plan to place more than 2,000 USAID workers on leave. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=26.2s)]
*  The Haltz plan gives, to give overseas aid workers [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=31.36s)]
*  just 30 days to move back to the country [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=34.44s)]
*  on the government's dime. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=37.08s)]
*  The judge claims it would have exposed workers [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=38.9s)]
*  and their families to unwarranted risk and expense. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=41.0s)]
*  And those rulings from the bench adding hurdles [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=45.28s)]
*  to Trump's plans to slash government wasteful spending. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=47.78s)]
*  But despite the block on actions to scale back USAID, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=52.5s)]
*  crews have already taken down signage [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=55.88s)]
*  from the agency's DC headquarters. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=58.28s)]
*  You've gotta just love all this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  What do you, I mean, let's just talk about this, Charlie, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=64.68s)]
*  from your, both of you guys are actually DC guys. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=68.0s)]
*  I know you're a rural guy, but you're a DC guy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  in a lot of ways, you know what's going on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  Just how absolutely explosive. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's insensitive. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=82.16s)]
*  And revolutionary is what we have seen in the last. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=83.0s)]
*  No, Griffin and I were just talking about it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=85.88s)]
*  a minute ago off camera. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=86.96s)]
*  Like you, it's like you're three weeks in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  and are going into our third week [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=91.16s)]
*  and you literally can't, you can't walk away [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=93.6s)]
*  from your phone for 10 minutes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=96.2s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=97.68s)]
*  Because then you come back and there's some whole other thing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=98.52s)]
*  that is going on that Trump's doing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=101.08s)]
*  And it's like, and these are all things [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=103.28s)]
*  that conservatives have sort of, you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=105.0s)]
*  pined for and talked about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=107.08s)]
*  Fantasized about. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=108.84s)]
*  Fantasized about, exactly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=110.0s)]
*  And then Trump is just like doing it all [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=111.72s)]
*  and doing it all like every, like three times in a day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=114.72s)]
*  Like a Tuesday, we're gonna shut down this, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=118.28s)]
*  we're gonna shut down this, and we're gonna shut down this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=120.56s)]
*  I do think it's interesting though that, you know, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=122.4s)]
*  you've got these legal challenges. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=123.92s)]
*  And do the courts really wanna get involved [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=125.52s)]
*  in the particulars of how the executive, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=129.36s)]
*  the head of the executive branch wants to curtail spending [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=132.4s)]
*  and be a better guard of taxpayer dollars? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=136.28s)]
*  I think it's a pretty short runway [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=140.2s)]
*  for justice on that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=143.8s)]
*  It's interesting from that legal angle [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=144.76s)]
*  that you're talking about [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=147.2s)]
*  and do the courts wanna get involved? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=148.04s)]
*  You know, on a more basic level, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=149.6s)]
*  it's putting Democrats in a terrible position [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=151.76s)]
*  where they're like defending USAID [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=154.8s)]
*  and like transgender operas in foreign countries [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=157.44s)]
*  and like just all this crazy stuff they're uncovering. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=160.24s)]
*  And there's more to come. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=163.56s)]
*  I mean, they've only reached, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  Doge has only reached a few agencies. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=166.16s)]
*  I heard they, you know, I've got some sources. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=168.12s)]
*  They just arrived at transportation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=170.64s)]
*  Who knows what they'll uncover there? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=172.76s)]
*  So like every, I got a good source there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  It's like, you know, one after another, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=177.64s)]
*  and we're just gonna keep seeing this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  And how do the Democrats defend this? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=183.76s)]
*  Cause it's not popular. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=186.0s)]
*  So this is such an important point. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=187.56s)]
*  And for the conservative movement, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=189.44s)]
*  I mean, I started in talk radio in the nineties [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=191.2s)]
*  producing Ali North radio show [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  when Sean Hannity was taken off, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=195.56s)]
*  when Rush Limbaugh was the king. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=197.04s)]
*  Back to Rush Limbaugh days in the nineties, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=198.56s)]
*  conservatives have been talking [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  about over bloated bureaucratic government [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=202.76s)]
*  and how it does not serve the American people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=206.48s)]
*  And to Charlie's point, here we are 30 years later [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=209.36s)]
*  and Trump said, I'm taking a wrecking ball to it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=213.16s)]
*  And it's actually happening and it's really remarkable. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=216.16s)]
*  And what you're finding is that Democrats [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=220.2s)]
*  aren't defending the actual transgender opera in Columbia [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=223.56s)]
*  or the DEI program in Serbia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=228.44s)]
*  They're literally showing that they are addicted [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=230.68s)]
*  to the status quo. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=234.6s)]
*  And the addiction to the status quo [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=236.56s)]
*  is this over bloated bureaucracy [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=238.48s)]
*  that is wasting American taxpayer dollars [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=241.68s)]
*  in places like USAID. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it's more than addiction. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=245.56s)]
*  I think their entire apparatus has been upheld by this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=247.12s)]
*  They have been funding media outlets. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=252.04s)]
*  They have been funding, you know, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=253.6s)]
*  revolutions in other countries. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=255.64s)]
*  We have been funding all kinds of stuff [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=257.28s)]
*  that the American people never signed up for. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  And there are people that are profiting off that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=262.0s)]
*  There are NGOs, there's a whole mediocre class of people [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  who have been surviving off of the largesse [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=267.67999999999995s)]
*  of the American people through these shadowy networks [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  within these agencies. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=274.11999999999995s)]
*  And luckily out of these agencies, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  we're also getting some whistleblowers [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=277.44s)]
*  to help us see not just all the stuff [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  that the little engineers, the 20 year olds [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  as they're calling them are uncovering, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  but people within the agencies who have been disgusted [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=285.8s)]
*  with what they've seen and are coming forward. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=288.04s)]
*  Here's somebody who was an employee at USAID. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=290.36s)]
*  He was on Jesse Waters show [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=293.6s)]
*  and talked to also to the Fox digital people as well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=295.24s)]
*  This is from an op-ed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=301.44s)]
*  He said, how USAID went woke and destroyed itself. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=302.6s)]
*  He said, USAID was formed in 1961 to counter Soviet efforts [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=307.88s)]
*  to spread communism in the developing world. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  The transition former communist countries [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=314.88s)]
*  and to transition former communist countries into US allies [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=317.84s)]
*  and respond to global disasters. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=320.84s)]
*  But sometime during the Clinton administration, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=322.4s)]
*  USAID began to promote radical social agendas [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=324.92s)]
*  such as population control. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  Under president Barack Obama, LGBT and climate ideologies [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=329.84s)]
*  were added and then president Joe Biden topped it off [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=332.88s)]
*  with transgenderism. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=335.68s)]
*  Institutionally, its political culture [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  would eventually skew far left, purge of conservatives [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=339.12s)]
*  and independence and here is. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=342.4s)]
*  So, but just real quick, that's somebody who loves USAID [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  and loves the work USAID does, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  but recognizes that it's completely gone off the rails. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  And then a completely separate whistleblower [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=357.12s)]
*  went on Jesse last night and basically said the same thing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=359.88s)]
*  And again, these are the people that love the mission, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  but realize it's gone completely off the rails. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  I was elevated to be the acting deputy chief of staff [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=370.02s)]
*  of the global health bureau during COVID [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=372.7s)]
*  and I immediately observed incredible delay and arrogance [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=375.26s)]
*  on the part of career bureaucrats who I fought [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=379.9s)]
*  and frankly cleaned up their mess. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=382.58s)]
*  And instead of being appreciative [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=384.38s)]
*  that we avoided a embarrassment, I was retaliated against. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  I had to sue them under the whistleblower protection act, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=390.02s)]
*  which is detailed in my op-ed. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=392.94s)]
*  And then they proceeded to botch 10 times more money. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=395.06s)]
*  I should add, this was under the career bureaucrats. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=398.78s)]
*  There were political appointees [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  like our recent assistant administrator, Atul Gawande, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=402.44s)]
*  who did a good job of streamlining bureaucracy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=405.14s)]
*  And that's where there are important programs [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=407.29999999999995s)]
*  that I'm concerned are gonna be thrown out [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=409.9s)]
*  with a bureaucracy that has grown over six decades [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=412.05999999999995s)]
*  without enough accountability. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=415.5s)]
*  There have been efforts to reform it, not successful. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=417.05999999999995s)]
*  And so I hope that this can be an act [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=419.5s)]
*  of creative destruction, which is a good thing, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  instead of just total destruction, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  which would be the concern of overreach. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=425.97999999999996s)]
*  Sounds like the American people, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=428.38s)]
*  from what I'm hearing and feeling around the country, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=429.74s)]
*  and I am in touch with a lot of people around the country, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=432.74s)]
*  they're willing to take that gamble. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=435.6s)]
*  They're willing to see some good stuff [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=436.65999999999997s)]
*  just ends up getting cut [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=438.82s)]
*  just to get rid of this whole Leviathan. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=440.7s)]
*  Yeah, and look, you know, both President Trump [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=444.3s)]
*  and Elon Musk and others have said, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  you look at things like PEPFAR [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=449.5s)]
*  and the combating AIDS in Africa, you know, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=451.26s)]
*  important things aren't going to die here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=454.18s)]
*  The USAID, of course, will have the purview, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=457.42s)]
*  State Department overseeing it, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=460.22s)]
*  and can keep these programs [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=461.46000000000004s)]
*  that are serving a purpose in place, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  and American people will support that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=465.46000000000004s)]
*  It's just a waste in our hard-earned tax dollars [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  that we're gonna rein in a little bit. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=470.38000000000005s)]
*  Joni Ernst talked earlier this week [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=471.82000000000005s)]
*  that she tried to get oversight, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=473.5s)]
*  and many senators have been saying this, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=476.18s)]
*  they've been trying to get oversight over USAID [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=478.18s)]
*  and get some transfer, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=480.54s)]
*  and they were never allowed in to look at it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=481.38s)]
*  So maybe you have to sort of get rid of all of it, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  and then we can go, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  oh, this is a good program to help children with AIDS. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=488.58000000000004s)]
*  Which is preposterous, by the way, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=491.3s)]
*  because Congress created USAID. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=492.22s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=494.42s)]
*  It's, for a lot of them, it is a religion, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=495.26s)]
*  but it's also, it become, as you point out, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=498.26s)]
*  a structure from which they make lots of money. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wYWBUZJRKw&t=500.38s)]
