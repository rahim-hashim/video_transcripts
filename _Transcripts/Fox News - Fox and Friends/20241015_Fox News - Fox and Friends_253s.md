# Biden-Harris have their ‘foot on our neck’: Sen. Mullin
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4)
*  All right. This morning, GOP lawmakers outraged as they claim the Biden Harris administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=0.0s)]
*  is blocking them from getting more answers about an Afghan national charge with an election [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=6.84s)]
*  day plot. Our next guest says this has particularly hardened his state where the Oklahoma City [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=11.84s)]
*  bombing is still painful. GOP Senator Mark Wayne Mullen sits on the Senate Armed Services [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=17.04s)]
*  Committee and joins us now. Senator, first off, I know the House side feels as though [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=21.26s)]
*  they weren't talked to at all. Were you briefed and what could you tell the audience about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=26.0s)]
*  who this 27-year-old is? Yeah, I was briefed a few weeks prior to this, not by the FBI [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=30.18s)]
*  but from a different agency. What we understood is this individual was vulnerable to touch [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=36.82s)]
*  points, meaning that they were accepted in on an SIV, special immigration visa, but there's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=41.22s)]
*  a confusion if he was prior or after the withdrawal. We believe that he was rushed with an SIV [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=47.74s)]
*  after the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and that way, and it wasn't proper vetting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=54.86s)]
*  to actually say he was an SIV. The issue that we have here, Brian, is there's thousands [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  of individuals that was rushed over here because the Harris-Biden withdrawal and they weren't [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  properly vetted. And when you don't properly vet them, you don't know what their touch [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=69.3s)]
*  points. Touch points mean their vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities mean what can be leveraged [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=71.86s)]
*  against the individual to make them turn on their host country like this individual did. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=75.82s)]
*  Fortunately, the FBI was doing their job. They did it correctly that no one was actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=81.18s)]
*  at harm, but they caught the individual. How many individuals are out there that we're [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=85.94s)]
*  not paying attention to? Right, and you're convinced that they have the right guy and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=90.02s)]
*  what they say is true. Sometimes this stuff unwinds differently. So this guy was going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  to try to pull something off because we watched his neighbors. His neighbors had no idea that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=98.82s)]
*  this would, he was up to. They thought he was a normal guy. There's something else the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=103.02s)]
*  Trump team wants you to do. Let's be a surrogate. You will kick off your battleground tour with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=106.86s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard over in Nevada where I think the Trump team got some good news. Las Vegas [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=111.66s)]
*  Review Journal just endorsed him as the pick. What is your message? What is the Trump economic [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=116.7s)]
*  message that he wants you to get out? Well, we're traveling, I'm in Austin right now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=122.66s)]
*  I head to Reno right after this interview, go to Carson City, then Rolla, then North, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=127.34s)]
*  then to Charlotte. We're hitting the business communities in the Native American areas. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=131.54s)]
*  And the business community, let's put the economy back on track, Brian. Washington, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=136.38s)]
*  D.C. has never created a job in its life, but it is supposed to create an atmosphere [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=140.42s)]
*  for job creators to create those jobs. What's happening there at the Harris Biden administration [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=144.7s)]
*  is it's cutting our blood flow to our head. It's literally, they got their foot on their [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=148.66s)]
*  neck regulating us to death and they're choking out the economy. With Native Americans, it's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  about sovereignty and the ability to actually use the land that was given to us, not necessarily [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=158.1s)]
*  given to us, but it was taken away then given to us. And it's about self-determination. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=166.06s)]
*  Native Americans are, I'm Cherokee, right? And we have the ability to actually use the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=170.34s)]
*  resources that's under our feet that we walk over every day. But right now, the way the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=175.54s)]
*  Department of Interior works and the way this administration works, we're having tribes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  that are asking permission to do everything just as simple as healthcare, just simple [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=184.34s)]
*  education, just transportation, just economic development inside the land that is blessed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=188.34s)]
*  to be theirs. And what the Native American community is saying, hey, let us be sovereign. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=194.8s)]
*  Let us have self-determination. Let us make our own way. Quit babysitting us. And the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=199.82s)]
*  Trump administration has a very strong record on that first four years he was in office [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=204.26s)]
*  and we're saying, hey, we're going to bring that back plus plus it up and make it even [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=208.38s)]
*  better for you guys to build to be self-determined. It would be good too. There's Native American [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=212.18s)]
*  issues when it comes to enforcing the border. It would be good to see cooperation there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=216.54s)]
*  Oh my goodness, yes. And there is no cooperation right now, Brian. There is zero communication [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=219.98s)]
*  with the Harris Biden administration, zero outreach to our Native American allies and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=225.1s)]
*  partners, by the way. And it's frustrating for all of us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=230.7s)]
*  All right, Senator Mark-Wayne Mullen, thanks so much for joining us. And it looks like [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  you dodged a bullet over in Oklahoma with that 27-year-old apprehension. Appreciate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=237.5s)]
*  it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu-P_2HMR4&t=242.18s)]
