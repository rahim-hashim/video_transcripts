# 'FIRE THEM ALL': Trump tells Hegseth to get rid of generals
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM)
*  So yesterday was Trump's first cabinet meeting. Lawrence went down there. He was standing with everyone in the press and asked a few questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's one he asked to Donald Trump and to Pete Hegsath about firing the generals who were responsible for the withdrawal of Afghanistan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=7.12s)]
*  Mr. President, you were just talking about Afghanistan and the bots withdrawal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=16.32s)]
*  Have all the generals or command staff that were involved with the withdrawal been fired or relieved of duty? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=21.6s)]
*  Well, that's a great idea. I'm not going to tell this man what to do, but I will say that if I had his place, I'd fire every single one of them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=27.68s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=37.64s)]
*  Well, it's a question we thought a lot about. We're doing a complete review of every single aspect of what happened with the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan and plan to have full accountability. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=38.96s)]
*  It's one of the first things we announced at the Defense Department for that reason, sir. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=49.28s)]
*  Certainly, General Raisin Cain, who's on his way in, was not a part of that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=53.08s)]
*  Instead, he was a part of leading the effort against ISIS by untying the hands of warfighters, finishing the job properly and bringing our troops home. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=58.08s)]
*  So we're taking a very different view, obviously, than the previous administration, and there will be full accountability. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=65.28s)]
*  I don't see big promotions in that group. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=70.4s)]
*  And I think I think they're going to be largely gone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=72.84s)]
*  You know, it was a telling moment because it's obvious where the Secretary of Defense stands on this issue before he became Secretary of Defense. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  But it's a much different role when you become the Secretary of Defense, because when you before you can fire these people or relieve them of duty, you got to have due cause. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=84.28s)]
*  And so he has to let the investigation take place. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=93.4s)]
*  But of course, he's just gotten that directive from the president saying, hey, I want them gone, essentially on live television. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=96.52s)]
*  And I think he's leaning to that direction. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=102.2s)]
*  But he has to have the investigation take place before he makes that ultimate decision. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  What investigation do you need to do? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  We know that Joe Biden was told by his generals, don't do it this way. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, it was Joe Biden's responsibility. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=115.64s)]
*  And he even said in a press conference after all those Americans were killed, he said, OK, the buck stops with me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=118.48s)]
*  Yeah. But. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=124.6s)]
*  He now it's now it's going to be like, OK, we want to hear from the generals who tried to talk him out of doing what he did. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  And yesterday, President Trump said that Biden was the one who gave up Bagram Air Base. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=133.88s)]
*  He said we left all of that equipment behind. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=138.68s)]
*  He said we could land anything on those runways. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=140.96s)]
*  It's so strategically placed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=143.4s)]
*  We need those runways. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=144.76s)]
*  And we gave it up or Joe Biden gave it up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=146.32s)]
*  He said, and don't forget the 13 who were killed at the Abbey Gate and also the 40 people that were badly injured. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=148.28s)]
*  Well, I know that and to your point, Steve, Joe Biden is ultimately responsible for what took place. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=155.12s)]
*  But there are a lot of military aspects and components of it where they failed on the fact that they gave up the base, as you noted, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  the fact that they left the military equipment that the enemy now has right now and are flunting it all over the Internet. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  The fact that they took the soldiers out of there before they took all the other civilians from out there, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=177.72s)]
*  the fact that there was a sniper that saw the IED, that saw someone that was suspicious and someone in command didn't give the order to disarm them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=185.36s)]
*  So there were definitely a lot of military mishaps there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=196.44s)]
*  And I think that's what the SEC is going to be investigating before he makes that ultimate decision. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZKKmlQHqM&t=200.8s)]
