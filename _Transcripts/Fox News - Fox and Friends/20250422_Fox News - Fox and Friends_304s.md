*  Calling out the calling the cuts unconstitutional. So these are grants. They're unconstitutional [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=7.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, the White House is reportedly considering pulling another billion dollars in funding accusing it of failing to address [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=12.42s)]
*  Antisemitism on campus and ending its DEI programs Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett joined us now [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=19.52s)]
*  Greg what about the tactic of not only saying no but suing back [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=25.88s)]
*  Sure, that's a possibility [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=32.44s)]
*  I mean look Harvard seems to be under the mistaken impression that it has a right to government grants [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  well [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=41.2s)]
*  the geniuses there at Harvard might want to check Webster's dictionary because a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=41.7s)]
*  Grant is a gift. It's discretionary the government can give money or not and it can also make the grants [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=46.72s)]
*  Conditional so in other words stop the rampant [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=54.76s)]
*  Antisemitism on campus protect the targeted Jewish students instead of coddling protesters that are threatening those students and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  ensure diversity viewpoints and the hostile [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=67.52s)]
*  Ideological intolerance get back to your core values educating young people but Harvard, you know run by far-left [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  faculty [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=79.48s)]
*  Refuses to do that. So it stands to lose close to three billion or more and that is their choice [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  And you know, maybe it's time that a private university with a fat [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  $52 billion endowment start paying some taxes. That's also at stake here [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=92.36s)]
*  I mean let's use people so, you know where we're at right now [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=97.16s)]
*  Harvard filed the lawsuit against Trump administration the administration requests the IRS revoke the taxes M status the DHS [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=99.68s)]
*  Threaten to deny foreign students from enrolling because we want to find out about their background with seeing some of the anti-americanism [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=106.84s)]
*  anti-semitism anti-israeli [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=113.64s)]
*  attitude arise and freezing 2.2 billion as you know in federal funds so [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=116.28s)]
*  Harvard says also that they're by halting any of the research [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  They are also hurting the chances of fighting cancer and helping soldiers coming back from war [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=126.32s)]
*  But if you're 501 c3 you have to be unbiased yet you could turn around if you're prosecuting this case great [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=131.36s)]
*  But you're the expert and say prove to me you're unbiased because only 3% of your faculty is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=137.52s)]
*  conservative prove to me you're unbiased when we look at your curriculum, especially when it comes to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=143.08s)]
*  political science and foreign affairs and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=147.52s)]
*  Middle East culture and they might not like that examination [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  Right, you should have been a lawyer a good argument Brian, you know legally Harvard [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=155.44s)]
*  I think is facing an uphill battle try to explain in court why a super rich elite private university with a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=160.68s)]
*  shameful record of bias and intolerance [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=168.36s)]
*  Should receive billions in taxpayer money while the gift-giver the government here cannot set reasonable [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=171.4s)]
*  Conditions one of the important questions has Harvard stopped violating civil rights with radically [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Discriminatory quotas which the Supreme Court found the university guilty of the the Trump administration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Quite reasonably wants to know have you fixed it and if you have not fixed it by law [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=193.4s)]
*  Harvard can be deprived of federal funds [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  They can also lose their tax exempt status for violating religious freedom amid all of the ugly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=202.92s)]
*  Anti-Semitism on Harvard's campus. Yeah, by the way, Billy Jones in Indiana the valedictorian doesn't get in but some guy [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=211.48s)]
*  From the Middle East does some activists from Syria or Algeria [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=218.28s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the American people are fed up with that also just real quick a statement from the administration [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=221.88s)]
*  Essentially saying the gravy train is over and they came out with this last night [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=227.64s)]
*  The gravy train of federal assistance institutions like Harvard which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with taxpayer dollars from struggling American families [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=232.92s)]
*  Is coming to an end and guess what taxpayer funds are a privilege and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=240.48s)]
*  And lastly, you know, who's prosecuting Harvard's case? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  Robert Herr all those horrible things you said about Robert Herr when he interviewed President Biden now you love him [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=250.6s)]
*  I don't know if they can have it both ways [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=256.8s)]
*  very interesting [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=259.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know Harvard doesn't teach anymore it indoctrinates and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=262.08s)]
*  Taxpayers shouldn't pay for that far-left [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  Intolerance in anti-Semitism. I'm so glad I refused to go there. I made it I made a statement [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314_v3875Mo&t=270.84000000000003s)]
