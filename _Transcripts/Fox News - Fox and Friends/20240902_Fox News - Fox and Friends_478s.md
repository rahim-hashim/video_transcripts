# Trey Yingst: 'At this point, diplomacy has failed'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4)
*  And we go straight to that Fox News alert. The funeral for Hirsch Goldberg Poland, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=0.0s)]
*  American hostage killed by Hamas in Gaza, will be held today at nine a.m. Eastern time [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=7.2s)]
*  in Israel. Also today, President Biden returns to the White House after a two week long vacation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=12.56s)]
*  to meet with Vice President Harris in the Situation Room. Now, the two reportedly will [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=19.44s)]
*  sit down with the U.S. hostage negotiating team to discuss efforts to secure a deal to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=23.2s)]
*  release the remaining hostages. I mean, shouldn't they have already been working on this? In [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=28.92s)]
*  New York City, thousands gathered at a vigil last night. Remember the six murdered hostages [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=33.400000000000006s)]
*  found in a tunnel in Rafa over the weekend. And this is a live look at a massive protest in Israel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=38.2s)]
*  calling for a ceasefire and hostage release deal as a big labor strike causes a standstill at [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  businesses, schools and Israel's largest airport. Trey Yankst is live in Tel Aviv. Hey, Trey. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=51.16s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. Demonstrations erupted across Israel overnight after the country's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=60.04s)]
*  health ministry announced that six Israeli hostages were executed in Hamas captivity. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=65.64s)]
*  Thousands of people blocked Israel's main highway that runs through the second largest city of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=71.64s)]
*  Tel Aviv. Clashes unfolded between police and protesters with security forces bringing in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=76.6s)]
*  horses and water cannons to clear the road. The demonstrators demanded that the government [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=82.28s)]
*  reach a hostage agreement and bring the remaining captives in Gaza home. Take a look. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  There are clear disagreements between Israeli leadership, between Israel's defense minister, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=93.8s)]
*  Yoav Galant and the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. For the people here in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=97.88s)]
*  streets of Tel Aviv, they are not interested in politics. They are not interested in what the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=102.68s)]
*  government has to say unless it is bringing the hostages home. We do know that we want a deal now [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=107.4s)]
*  because those people supposed to be home yesterday. The unrest about the hostages shifted to civil [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=114.84s)]
*  protests with a broad general strike announced today. Israel's international airport was on [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=122.28s)]
*  strike for two hours this morning affecting incoming and outgoing flights. Other transportation is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=126.68s)]
*  affected as well including Jerusalem's light rail train. With frustration growing across Israel [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=131.96s)]
*  about the lack of a deal, President Biden will meet with Vice President Harris in the situation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=137.08s)]
*  room later today to discuss things with the American negotiating team. Officials in Washington [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=141.56s)]
*  will look for a way to move the ceasefire talks forward giving both Israel and Hamas an exit ramp [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=146.68s)]
*  to end the war. The uncertainty about Gaza comes as Israel launched fresh strikes against the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=152.12s)]
*  Iran-backed group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon overnight. Now the war inside Gaza has been ongoing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=157.0s)]
*  for the past 332 days and still there are no clear diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=162.68s)]
*  Guys back to you. You know Trey, the emotion of grief and loss is not logical. It's just you just [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=169.0s)]
*  feel and the reason why I ask put that into the context is because when you look at Benjamin [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=175.56s)]
*  Netanyahu, the IDF has already described from day one tried to do hostage negotiations. They've been [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=181.32s)]
*  out there to get their people back. Do the people of Israel, the people that are protesting in the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=187.48s)]
*  street actually think there would be some type of deal even when you have Sinwar that is saying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=193.8s)]
*  that he wants to be a part of the deal meaning that the IDF will stop all plans to go after him. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=199.24s)]
*  Do they think there's some type of negotiation that can be reached? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=205.08s)]
*  Yeah Lawrence, it's a great question. Look the majority of the families of hostages still being [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  held inside Gaza, more than a hundred of them, some dead, some alive, do believe a deal is possible [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=215.96s)]
*  and it really comes down to the individual. We talked with one man last night at that demonstration [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  whose son is still being held in Gaza. He's believed to be alive. He was taken on October 7th [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  on Black Saturday from the Nova Music Festival and you could see the pain in his eyes. He didn't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=233.64s)]
*  care how the government got there but just that they were able to cut an agreement with Hamas [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  and get the remaining hostages out of Gaza. There's an understanding that time is running out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=244.2s)]
*  and as Hamas gets back into a corner, Israeli forces continue to push deeper into central Gaza. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  The last remaining Hamas stronghold there in the city of Deir al-Bala, they will start to act like [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=255.0s)]
*  caged animals. They will fight back in ways that they have not done so so far. As we unfortunately [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=260.28s)]
*  learned over the past 48 hours, will include executing hostages and that is what so many of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=266.52s)]
*  these families fear and it's why they are in the streets of Israel again today demanding an agreement. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=272.28s)]
*  You know Trey, if a deal were easy we'd have one right? You're negotiating with a terrorist [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=277.88s)]
*  organization. What's the biggest sticking point for both sides? What is each side holding onto [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  that makes a deal so difficult? Yeah look absolutely Israel is not negotiating with a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=286.68s)]
*  reasonable or rational actor. Hamas has changed their position from the beginning of these [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=293.48s)]
*  conversations. The Israelis have as well but they say they've offered a deal when it's not accepted [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=298.52s)]
*  they move forward with the war and continue to push deeper into Gaza. Look I've talked with both [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=303.8s)]
*  senior Israeli leadership including the country's defense minister Yoav Galant multiple times [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=308.76s)]
*  and senior Hamas leadership and just last week a senior Hamas official sent me a powerpoint of the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=313.64s)]
*  demands that his organization has and the two key discussions right now that basically are the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=320.52s)]
*  sticking points in the talks. One has to do with the Philadelphia corridor that strip of land that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  sits between Egypt and Gaza. It's about the width of a football field. The Israelis want to maintain [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=331.24s)]
*  a presence there. Hamas says they're not willing to move forward with an agreement if that's the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=336.52s)]
*  case. The other is the Nitsarim corridor you've seen from our reports inside Gaza. This is the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=340.76s)]
*  supply route the Israelis cut across Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea. They want to maintain a presence [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=346.12s)]
*  there in case they need to conduct operational raids inside Gaza. These are the two sticking [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=351.64s)]
*  points that Hamas says are non-starters for their organization but look each and every day the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=356.2s)]
*  goalposts are changing. The talks were taking place in Cairo Egypt. They shifted to Doha Qatar [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=360.68s)]
*  and as we speak there are still working groups trying to hammer out the details. Trey to that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=365.64s)]
*  point it seems as if when we talk about a deal it's frankly the deal with the devil and therefore [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=370.76s)]
*  what does international pressure, what role does it play in Israel's part right now saying why [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  why are we even wasting time negotiating a deal when to your point you are [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=381.88s)]
*  executing hostages and potentially executing more. What part does that play? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=386.28s)]
*  It's a great question and look when you step back from this situation you remember there are [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=391.0s)]
*  American citizens being held inside the Gaza Strip by Hamas in the tunnels beneath Gaza as we speak [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=397.56s)]
*  and so the president meeting with the vice president today in the situation room [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=404.68s)]
*  but it's not enough to simply hold meetings. Solutions need to come to the surface to get [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=408.92s)]
*  these remaining hostages out of Gaza and to end the war because look an ongoing conflict doesn't [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=414.44s)]
*  benefit either side. There are hostages American citizens being held in Gaza who will die if the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=420.52s)]
*  conflict continues as we have seen Hamas is now executing hostages according to the country's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=427.4s)]
*  health ministry here and for the Palestinian people thousands of civilians have been killed [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=432.44s)]
*  since the October 7th massacre during the Israeli air and ground campaign against Gaza and so the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=438.28s)]
*  idea of diplomacy, this shuttle diplomacy that's gone back and forth, American officials including [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=444.84s)]
*  top Biden administration officials traveling to the region simply ferrying messages back and forth [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  it's no longer enough. The clock is ticking people are dying on both sides of this conflict [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=455.64s)]
*  and at this point diplomacy has failed. So far you're right great job out there Trey. Thank you [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G6MJe_C-4&t=460.91999999999996s)]
