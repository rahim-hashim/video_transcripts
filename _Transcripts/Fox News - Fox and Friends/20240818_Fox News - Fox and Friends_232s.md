# This has to make the Iranian leadership nervous: KT McFarland
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo)
*  Former Trump deputy national security advisor, KT McFarland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=0.0s)]
*  KT, so far, the idea says they've taken out 17,000 of the 30,000 Hamas fighters. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=3.36s)]
*  Do you think that it's in their interest to stop fighting with so many, including Sinwar, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=9.8s)]
*  still alive? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=15.32s)]
*  No. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=16.32s)]
*  And Israel's just done something really significant in the last two weeks. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=17.32s)]
*  It's taken out three of the top four leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=22.96s)]
*  That's got to shake in Iran to its core, especially because one of the leaders they took out, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=29.52s)]
*  the political leader of Hamas, had been in Tehran for negotiations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=34.48s)]
*  He was killed in his own apartment that was protected by the Iranians in Tehran. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=38.26s)]
*  So that's got to make the Iranian leadership kind of nervous. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=42.84s)]
*  Does Mossad have our address, too? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=46.04s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=47.68s)]
*  I was so struck, though, when I read the White House announcement saying that Secretary Blinken [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=48.68s)]
*  to finalize the terms of the deal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=55.78s)]
*  Finalize? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=58.78s)]
*  There's nothing to finalize. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=59.78s)]
*  Nothing has changed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=61.14s)]
*  If anything, the Israelis are in a better position than they were before, but nobody [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=62.34s)]
*  looks like they're going to come to a peace agreement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=67.9s)]
*  And just so you know, Hamas says they have somebody monitoring there, no one officially [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=69.86s)]
*  there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  They say so far, the progress is just an illusion. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  So good luck with that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=78.66s)]
*  And we'll see, because one thing the Israelis have to do, they have to make sure if they [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=80.66s)]
*  don't take out the bulk of the Hamas fighters, we're going to be right back here in eight [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=85.44s)]
*  months with another horrific attack with rocket fire. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  The other major issue that everyone's keeping an eye on, and that is the penetration of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  Ukrainian forces into Russia beyond their borders, first time since World War II, it [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=98.08s)]
*  looks like Ukrainian forces have just destroyed a key bridge. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  They've moved 300 and over 300 square miles in direction territory. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=108.18s)]
*  As a story today that Vladimir Putin is basically frozen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=113.14s)]
*  He freezes in times of crisis and it's happening again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=117.28s)]
*  How how how destabilizing is this penetration? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=121.98s)]
*  I don't think it changes things in the long run. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  But what it does do, it shakes things up in the in the near term. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=130.54000000000002s)]
*  Once Putin, his initial goal was to go into Ukraine quickly two years ago, change the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=134.34s)]
*  government, be in charge. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=140.46s)]
*  And so for now, almost two years have been fighting and Ukraine has conducted itself [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=141.46s)]
*  unbelievably well against the Russian forces. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=145.78s)]
*  The Russian forces have not done well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=148.14s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this is now a war of attrition. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  War of attrition is always won by the country, which is bigger, has more resources and more [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=154.1s)]
*  people to throw into the fight. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=157.94s)]
*  And that's Russia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=159.5s)]
*  Now, what Ukraine has probably done is force Russia to divert some of its more seasoned [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=160.54s)]
*  and better troops to the area of Kursk around where the Ukrainians have gone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=166.34s)]
*  But at the same time, Ukraine had to devote really good troops to send there as well to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=171.02s)]
*  make that incursion. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=174.78s)]
*  At the end of the day, I think it helps Ukraine in a negotiated solution. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=176.14s)]
*  It puts it in a little better position. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=180.54s)]
*  But the only way this war ends, this forever war ends, is with a negotiated solution where [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=182.76s)]
*  each side is going to get something, not as much as they want. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=188.18s)]
*  But the good news for Ukraine is if they got a negotiated solution, Ukraine would start [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  rebuilding very quickly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  The world would rush in to help invest and rebuild Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  And that's not going to happen if the war ends for Russia. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=200.86s)]
*  Nobody's going to rush in to help rebuild Russia. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  They got their alliance with North Korea, Iran and China. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  I also understand St. Petersburg, they're sending drones in regularly, so destabilizing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  that city. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=213.62s)]
*  So now all of a sudden Russians are feeling this war that they started for no reason. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=214.72s)]
*  KT McFarland, thanks so much. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqv8z7lR9Qo&t=219.48s)]
