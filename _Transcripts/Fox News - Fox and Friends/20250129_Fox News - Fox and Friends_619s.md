*  stepped in threatened tariffs and the government back down [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=140.2s)]
*  right away so they're hoping that is going to send a really [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=143.84s)]
*  strong message to any other country that decides not to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=147.0s)]
*  cooperate and accept these planes with their own citizens [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=150.68s)]
*  inside guys. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=154.24s)]
*  Hey so Brooke I had a question for you there's a story in our [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=155.72s)]
*  packet today about how down in Florida. 2 vans were being [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  driven that had I think 24 Chinese nationals in it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=163.22s)]
*  They had been smuggled into the country apparently China will [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=167.56s)]
*  not take back their people obviously Ecuador does and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=171.4s)]
*  that's why that flight out of the just went there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=175.24s)]
*  What other countries have already said it have they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=178.28s)]
*  either said no don't send them or yes we'll take them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=181.34s)]
*  We know that a flight went to Guatemala and now Ecuador and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=185.34s)]
*  the authorities took them and again that flight that I [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=189.08s)]
*  mentioned to Columbia that denied these illegal migrants [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=191.48s)]
*  this was the perfect example right you have them denying [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=195.72s)]
*  their own citizens not taking them in president Trump [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  immediately taking action saying OK if you're going to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=201.86s)]
*  listen to me then watch what happens and this is the perfect [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=204.7s)]
*  example they want to show countries who do don't cooperate [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=208.26s)]
*  countries who do don't cooperate you don't listen to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxroCw0CFwI&t=211.5s)]
