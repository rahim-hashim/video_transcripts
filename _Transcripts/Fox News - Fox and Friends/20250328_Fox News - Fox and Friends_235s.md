# Anti-Elon Musk protesters prepare for global 'Tesla takedown' day
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8)
*  Oh, anti-Musk protesters prepare for a global Tesla takedown day of action tomorrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is responding to the escalating chaos. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=6.24s)]
*  The real problem is not—not the people—it's not like the crazy guy that firebombs a Tesla [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=10.36s)]
*  dealership. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=17.72s)]
*  It's the people pushing the propaganda that caused that guy to do it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=18.72s)]
*  Those are the real villains here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=26.92s)]
*  And we're going to go after them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  And the president's made it clear we're going to go after them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=31.0s)]
*  Here to react to all of this news, former Pennsylvania congressman Patrick Murphy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=34.16s)]
*  Patrick, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=37.76s)]
*  We had one of our reporters on the ground there asking Democratic representatives what [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=41.44s)]
*  they felt about this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=45.96s)]
*  This is what they had to say, Patrick. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=48.08s)]
*  Can you tell us what you think about what's happening with the Tesla products, the violence [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  at the dealerships? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=54.44s)]
*  What's your take on the situation? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=55.44s)]
*  I'm just trying. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=56.44s)]
*  What's your take on it? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=58.44s)]
*  Do you denounce the violence? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=59.44s)]
*  Why are people so upset when they see a Tesla in the parking lot? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=63.0s)]
*  You know, I can't comment to that, you know, in terms of public sentiment. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=66.16s)]
*  But do you think Democrats are to blame for why people are so triggered by this? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=71.28s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=75.44s)]
*  You know, Patrick, this whole scandal is kind of weird to me because most of the people [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=77.44s)]
*  that I know that drive Tesla are Democrats. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=81.8s)]
*  Right, Lawrence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And we got to make sure that we're clear that political violence has no place in our country, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  We have elections. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  They're over. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  You know, he's a private citizen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  He's doing what he can. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  I thought Brett Barr did a phenomenal job last night having them on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  We can talk about that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  But the reality is this, whether it was January 6th or whether it's bombing Tesla or spray [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  painting or putting splotches on, it's wrong. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=105.08s)]
*  It is wrong. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=107.88s)]
*  And they better not do it in my neighborhood. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=109.0s)]
*  They better not do it against my family members. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=110.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=113.24s)]
*  I think this also goes to the overall point of the temperature being high right now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  The rhetoric is going crazy right now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=120.24s)]
*  You got representatives that are using profanity. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=122.8s)]
*  I want to play this montage of some of the most recent examples from some of the Democratic [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=126.68s)]
*  officials. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=131.08s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=132.08s)]
*  And to see this administration claiming that it cares about competence and merit and then [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=133.08s)]
*  be responsible for an epic like this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=142.36s)]
*  What I repeat is that on the day that the person that should have been president had [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  to deliver her concession speech, I know it's going to be this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  When they go low, we go high. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  He can go. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Liberal friends, they always tell me, what about Trump? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  I think the difference is when you talk about Donald Trump, he's being his authentic self. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  This is a new occurrence for the Democrats. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=171.2s)]
*  Either they were faking before or they're faking now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=172.6s)]
*  But it's not consistent. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=175.28s)]
*  I don't think people are buying it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=176.28s)]
*  Do you? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=177.6s)]
*  Listen, I give up cursing for lead. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=178.6s)]
*  I give up cursing and ice cream for lead. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  So no matter if you're a Democrat or Republican, you got to be authentic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  You got to be genuine. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=189.56s)]
*  And I think that's why people are frustrated. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=190.56s)]
*  And I think they're frustrated because you're seeing the audio isn't matching the video. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  People are saying one thing and then doing another. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=198.16s)]
*  And that's the real frustrating thing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=200.28s)]
*  And I think that's why people are standing up and saying, hey, what's really going on [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=201.28s)]
*  here? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=204.4s)]
*  Well, I hope they get it together because I like competition. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=205.4s)]
*  I like a battle of the parties. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=209.08s)]
*  I used to be a Democrat. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=210.84s)]
*  I want them to go to the ideas that once inspired me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=211.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any hope right now, but we'll follow it, Patrick. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=215.68s)]
*  I know you're a proud Democrat still. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=219.36s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for joining the program. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1nFSZ_D5J8&t=220.92000000000002s)]
