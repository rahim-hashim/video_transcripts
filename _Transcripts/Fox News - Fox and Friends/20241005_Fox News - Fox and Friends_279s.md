*  Corey Campatore in the moments after shooting in Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=4.82s)]

*  emergency physician so he works in the emergency room familiar with this. You [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=22.02s)]
*  were here on July 13th when those shots rang out. Take us back to that moment if [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=26.16s)]
*  you would. Yeah it was a it's like a rock-and-roll concert. There's a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=30.44s)]
*  beautiful sky like today. I was up on the underneath the Jumbotron to Trump's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=34.0s)]
*  right. Shots rang out three or three bursts like pops. I thought there were [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=40.04s)]
*  firecrackers followed by pods and four other shots. Shortly after that we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=44.68s)]
*  everybody in the crowd turned to the right to look to where the shots were [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  coming from and shortly after that Trump was just surrounded by a pyramid of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=55.08s)]
*  Secret Service within an instant. I heard a woman probably about 40 feet [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZusfrfAHGo&t=61.48s)]
