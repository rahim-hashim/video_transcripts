# Alec Baldwin harassed by anti-Israel protester in NYC
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo)
*  All right, the chaos goes beyond all of these college campuses. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=0.0s)]
*  An anti-Israel protester actually harassing Alec Baldwin [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  at a New York City coffee shop, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=7.44s)]
*  demanding that he just says the words, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=9.46s)]
*  free Palestine, say it once, at least just say it once, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=11.3s)]
*  asking him this on camera. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=14.0s)]
*  Then he refuses to leave the shop [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=15.48s)]
*  when asked by the employees, watch. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=17.82s)]
*  One time, just one time, please, and I'll leave you alone. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=20.16s)]
*  Free Palestine, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=23.92s)]
*  f*** Israel, f*** Zionism. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=25.72s)]
*  Please say it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=28.24s)]
*  One time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  So he takes as, oh, go ahead, why don't you? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=35.44s)]
*  No, that person, the protester, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=39.24s)]
*  continued shouting at Baldwin as he headed toward the door, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=41.28s)]
*  asking, they started out with stuff like, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=44.22s)]
*  why'd you kill that lady, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=46.28s)]
*  talking about the involuntary manslaughter charge [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=47.16s)]
*  in the death of Rust cinematographer Helena Hutchins. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=49.86s)]
*  Then it continues on to what you just saw. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=55.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can listen on tape, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=57.0s)]
*  I do not blame him at all. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=58.52s)]
*  And this is not the first time [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=60.2s)]
*  protestors have confronted the actor. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=61.44s)]
*  Back in December, an activist in Manhattan [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=63.08s)]
*  got into a shouting match with Baldwin [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=65.44s)]
*  after asking if he supports Israel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=67.32s)]
*  Yeah, so for this discussion [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=69.84s)]
*  of everything going on across the country, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=71.32s)]
*  let's bring back in Lawrence Jones, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=73.16s)]
*  who's in Michigan at the Nest Egg Diner this morning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=74.34s)]
*  You know, I'll put this to you, Lawrence, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=77.8s)]
*  this is the conversation you and I had a little bit earlier [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=80.56s)]
*  about distancing yourself [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=82.92s)]
*  from certain elements of these protests. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=84.16s)]
*  I wanna read you a tweet from Congresswoman Cori Bush. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=85.92s)]
*  She said, as a Ferguson activist, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=89.2s)]
*  I know what it's like to have agitators [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  infiltrate our movement, manipulate the press, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=93.0s)]
*  fuel suppression of dissent by public officials [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=95.12s)]
*  and law enforcement. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=97.76s)]
*  We must reject these tactics [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=99.04s)]
*  to silence anti-war activists [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=100.48s)]
*  demanding divestment and genocide. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=102.12s)]
*  The problem, Lawrence, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=104.04s)]
*  Cori Bush needs to understand is, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=105.76s)]
*  as we've talked about, it's inseparable. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=108.06s)]
*  The quote unquote agitators are the protest, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=110.6s)]
*  the coherent debate is not taking place. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=114.36s)]
*  Instead, it is a call for intifada. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=117.96s)]
*  Yeah, the notion that this movement [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=123.0s)]
*  has been infiltrated with people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=126.6s)]
*  that are just trying to agitate is ridiculous. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=129.12s)]
*  I was on the ground immediately after October 7th [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=131.96s)]
*  talking with people on the college campuses, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=135.28s)]
*  and they said that the rapes did not happen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=137.6s)]
*  They said that it was Israel that started the conflict. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=139.96s)]
*  You know, I wanna take y'all back to school [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=143.48s)]
*  when you're reading about the civil rights movement, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  and you see all the pictures of the people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  that were trying to block integration. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=152.48s)]
*  That's where these people are gonna be in the history books. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=155.82s)]
*  These are the people that are blocking Jews [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  from going to class. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  You got a Columbia professor. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=163.2s)]
*  That key card was deactivated [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=165.04s)]
*  because the university said they could not protect him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  That's in America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  And the fact that they are allowing all of these tents [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=172.12s)]
*  to be little godsends all over the country, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=175.28s)]
*  the reality is, God, this is not Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  And you would think that the law enforcement officials [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=180.54s)]
*  would be able to enforce the law and say, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=182.82s)]
*  look, you guys are openly intimidating [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Jewish people in the country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=187.58s)]
*  And I say this fact all the time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=189.44s)]
*  When you have the FBI director saying [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=191.58s)]
*  that 60% of the hate crimes are against Jews, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=193.4s)]
*  and then you got the president of the United States [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  who wants to hold some type of bipartisan meeting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=199.08s)]
*  to talk about Islamophobia, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=203.36s)]
*  these people are out of their mind. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=205.64s)]
*  Right, and there's also some Jews, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=207.2s)]
*  they always say, well, there's some Jewish Americans [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=209.4s)]
*  on that campus protesting too, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=211.88s)]
*  which they should have their head examined. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=214.32s)]
*  But just real quick, back to Alec Baldwin for a second. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  I watched the whole thing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=219.08s)]
*  He's going to a coffee shop by himself, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=220.32s)]
*  He's getting screamed at. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=222.88s)]
*  Why'd you shoot that woman? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=225.08s)]
*  Then he's getting screamed at, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=226.6s)]
*  say Free Palestine, say Free Palestine. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  And she just right, literally right in his face. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=230.44s)]
*  And at the very end, he grabs the phone. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=233.76s)]
*  He asked the manager, call the cops. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=236.72s)]
*  Manager sits there with a mask on, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=240.24s)]
*  so you know where he stands. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=242.44s)]
*  And he sits there, puts his hand over it, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=244.28s)]
*  and this takes the phone, and you'll see it in a second. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=246.12s)]
*  He kind of does a half-way, he'll turn around. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=249.24s)]
*  And now he says, he asks her to leave. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=251.72s)]
*  She will not leave. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=253.22s)]
*  And he's gonna put her hand up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  He's trying to do the right thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=255.56s)]
*  And believe me, I know he has a temper, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=257.2s)]
*  but anybody would have reacted like this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=259.56s)]
*  This is something that we have to deal with. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=261.24s)]
*  I had a similar situation happen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=263.68s)]
*  You say to yourself, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=265.12s)]
*  do I want to make this a bigger situation, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=265.96s)]
*  or do I want to just walk away? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=268.32s)]
*  And he's trying to walk away and tell her to come out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=270.88s)]
*  And then finally he's gonna put up, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=273.48s)]
*  and he's just gonna grab the phone right out. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=275.36s)]
*  Yeah, I feel sorry for him. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=277.68s)]
*  Watch, there it goes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=278.52s)]
*  He was just minding his business, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to get a cup of coffee. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=281.16s)]
*  But that's Seinfeld too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=282.0s)]
*  Same thing happened to Seinfeld too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  He's gone outside a comedy club. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=284.08s)]
*  They're protesting his appearance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=285.84s)]
*  So not only are you not doing a sit-in on the lawn, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  but because you're not saying free Palestine, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=290.08s)]
*  that's now an issue in New York City. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=292.4s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHq6TKjeIKo&t=294.96s)]
