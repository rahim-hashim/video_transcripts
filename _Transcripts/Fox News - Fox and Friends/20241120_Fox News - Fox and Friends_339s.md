# Zelenskyy asked about potential peace deal with Russia
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA)
*  Fox News alert, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev now shut down over the threat of a Russian air [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=0.0s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=4.92s)]
*  This comes after President Biden gave the green light for Ukraine to start using attack [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=5.92s)]
*  missiles to strike inside Russia for the first time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  Vladimir Putin officially lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, which he always [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=12.76s)]
*  says. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=16.84s)]
*  Fox News chief foreign correspondent and Black Saturday author Trey Yanks joins us now after [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=17.84s)]
*  his interview with President Zelensky yesterday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=23.32s)]
*  We're going to hear a little bit more of that in a moment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=25.84s)]
*  First off, Trey, you've been there when the war first started. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=28.52s)]
*  You go back now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=31.06s)]
*  What's the big difference? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=32.4s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=33.4s)]
*  Many things here in Ukraine are actually the same as they were about two and a half years [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=36.96s)]
*  ago when the Russians launched that ground invasion on February 24th of 2022. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=40.4s)]
*  Just hours after we arrived in the country, air raid sirens were sounding from Kiev to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=46.7s)]
*  Lviv, sending millions of people to bomb shelters as the Russians continue both air and ground [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=50.78s)]
*  attacks. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=56.8s)]
*  Now Iranian drones and missiles to target major population centers here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=58.08s)]
*  And there's real concern today that following that approval from the Americans, allowing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  the Ukrainians to launch long range missiles into Russian territory, that there will be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=67.64s)]
*  further Russian retaliation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=72.17999999999999s)]
*  We heard air raid sirens earlier today in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and the U.S. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=74.24s)]
*  Embassy here in this population center of about four million people issued a rare alert [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=79.0s)]
*  this morning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=84.16s)]
*  The U.S. Embassy in Kiev received specific information of a potential significant air [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=85.52s)]
*  attack on November 20th. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=90.24s)]
*  The embassy will be closed and recommends U.S. citizens be prepared to immediately shelter [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=91.96s)]
*  in the event of an air alert if one is announced. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=96.82s)]
*  This is significant and again, unprecedented to see the embassy close here in the Ukrainian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=99.94s)]
*  capital. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke with the mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  He was warning civilians here to stay close to shelters, but he wanted to emphasize one [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=109.16s)]
*  point, saying that Ukraine has been under attack for more than a thousand days and that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  missile attacks against this city and other major population centers across the country [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=118.0s)]
*  aren't rare at all. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=122.72s)]
*  Yeah, yesterday we understand there were eight missiles, two were knocked down by the Russians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  We don't know about the damage. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=128.64s)]
*  Here's a little more of your interview with President Zelensky. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=130.24s)]
*  You have not seen, they have not seen at home yet. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=133.48s)]
*  You lived it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=136.34s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=137.34s)]
*  Have you accepted that under any sort of ceasefire agreement or peace deal that some Ukrainian [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=138.74s)]
*  territory may remain in Russian hands? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=145.9s)]
*  We cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  That is about those territories which used to be occupied by Putin before the full scale [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  invasion since 2014. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  Legally, we are not acknowledging that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=166.9s)]
*  We are not adopting that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=169.5s)]
*  On the other hand, we understand that so far we do not have that much of force, so that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=171.74s)]
*  in the weapons with our hands we could push Putin back to the line of 1991. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=177.88s)]
*  When we look at the diplomatic red lines for the Russians, the other side of this ultimate [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=183.62s)]
*  negotiation that will take place one day, one of those red lines is Crimea, a portion [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=188.96s)]
*  of Ukraine that was annexed in 2014. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=195.48s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin has been very clear Crimea will never return to Ukrainian hands. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=199.68s)]
*  Are you willing to give up Crimea in pursuit of a peace deal to end this war and stop the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=205.52s)]
*  bloodshed in Europe? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=211.46s)]
*  I was already mentioning that we are ready to bring Crimea back diplomatically. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=213.32s)]
*  We cannot spend dozens of thousands of our people so that they perish for the sake of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=220.7s)]
*  Crimea and come back. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=227.1s)]
*  And still, it's not the fact that we can bring it back with the arms in our hands. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=229.22s)]
*  So we understand that Crimea can be brought back diplomatically. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  We spent more than 10 hours with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky along the eastern [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=240.7s)]
*  And he says they will continue fighting even if U.S. support is cut. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=246.44s)]
*  But he did tell us he believes Ukraine will lose the war if Ukraine loses military funding [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=251.0s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=256.12s)]
*  Real quick, you were there in the beginning of the war with him, you've interviewed him [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=258.4s)]
*  before. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=260.92s)]
*  He looks the same. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=262.04s)]
*  I mean, for a guy that's not seeing his family every day he's at war for a thousand days, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=263.04s)]
*  what is your takeaway? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=268.52s)]
*  Yeah, he was jovial. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=270.36s)]
*  He was very talkative about the situation on the ground. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=272.56s)]
*  And later today on Fox will have more information about what he told us regarding those long [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=275.08s)]
*  range U.S. supplied missiles. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=279.92s)]
*  I asked him, have you considered this? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=281.76s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=284.48s)]
*  Is the Biden administration willing to let Ukraine fire these missiles into Russia? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=285.48s)]
*  And he said, not yet. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=290.32s)]
*  We haven't fired any today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=291.74s)]
*  Hours later, according to reports, Zelensky ordered those strikes into Russian territory. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=293.76s)]
*  And so he still is very active in the process despite being a relatively young leader with [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=299.88s)]
*  not a lot of military background. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=303.76s)]
*  But we do know he wants to continue the fight and he is calling on the incoming administration [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  to support him in those efforts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=310.56s)]
*  Brian? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=312.24s)]
*  There are bad guys in this fight and it's not him and it's not the Ukrainians. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=313.24s)]
*  Trey, thanks so much. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=317.0s)]
*  Great job. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=318.36s)]
*  Look forward to seeing more of your interview from one war zone to another. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHR7KfLJMBA&t=319.36s)]
