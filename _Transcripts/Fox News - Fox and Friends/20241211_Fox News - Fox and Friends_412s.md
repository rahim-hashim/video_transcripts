# NY Times finally acknowledges primary cause of 'staggering' migrant numbers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo)
*  Look at this all new reporting this hour as we learn the surge of migrants under the Biden administration is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=0.0s)]
*  The largest in US history 60% of which are illegal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=6.66s)]
*  Griff Jenkins joins us with a look at the staggering numbers Griff. What do you know? Yeah? Well, good morning in Lawrence [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=11.64s)]
*  This comes as probably no surprise to the entire nation who have watched before their own eyes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=18.04s)]
*  The past four years of the border crisis Fox has covered it and on the ground and from our drones [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=22.56s)]
*  And you have seen it and now the New York Times is crunching government data [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=28.44s)]
*  Realizing that this border crisis may go down in the history books as the biggest story of the Biden administration [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=32.32s)]
*  The Times took a deep dive into that government data and found the surge is the largest in US history [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=38.52s)]
*  Surpassing the great immigration boom of the late [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=43.74s)]
*  1800s they say annual net migration the number of people coming to the country minus the number leaving averaged [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=47.16s)]
*  2.4 million people from 2021 to 2023 [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  according to the Congressional Budget Office and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=58.04s)]
*  They found that the total net migration during the Biden administration is likely to exceed 8 million people in the article [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=60.4s)]
*  They write this that's a faster pace of arrivals [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=67.44s)]
*  Then during any other period on record including the peak years of Ellis Island traffic when millions of Europeans came to the United States now [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=70.6s)]
*  Their analysis did as you mentioned Brian include both legal and illegal immigration and found 60% of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=78.68s)]
*  Immigrants who have entered the country since 2021 have done so without legal authorization [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=84.56s)]
*  All of this comes as president-elect Trump is set to hit the ground with a mandate on day one with a plan for mass [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=89.84s)]
*  Deportations after all Trump says that after mass illegal immigration you're going to need mass [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Deportation but one thing is for sure finally even the New York Times is putting it front and center that this crisis has led to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=104.68s)]
*  unprecedented numbers and they found also when you look a little deeper that the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  US foreign-born population has increased to over 15% the highest ever on record as well and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=118.16s)]
*  Interestingly, I'll leave you with this they went through a section where they say well [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  What have caught what may have caused this they write the welcoming immigration policy during Biden's first three years in office as [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=130.48s)]
*  The primary cause of the of the border crisis guys [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  Clearly and you've covered this for years [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=152.6s)]
*  No, nobody knows so better clearly the New York Times is trying to explain to their baffled readers [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=155.12s)]
*  Why Joe Biden lost and you know the immigration was one of the top two issues and now it's like [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=160.7s)]
*  So many people in the country illegally and Americans don't like it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=167.04s)]
*  Well, and what's remarkable is that the New York Times I would [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=172.04s)]
*  Guess really that they realized where the American people are and we saw that in the election results [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=176.6s)]
*  And I do think that the border crisis will go down in the history books years from now as the biggest story of the Biden era [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=182.78s)]
*  What's really remarkable though? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=190.14s)]
*  I just got back from the border last week is that you still have these mayors that are saying that they will not [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=191.96s)]
*  cooperate with ice and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=199.4s)]
*  The Fed the feds when they triangle after the over 1 million illegal criminal aliens that pose a public safety [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=201.48s)]
*  Risk you just had yesterday in San Diego County [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=209.44s)]
*  three out of four [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=212.8s)]
*  Board of Supervisors voting to go even further in their sanctuary policy than already on the books [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=214.68s)]
*  It's gonna be quite something to watch. Yeah, you know why Massachusetts to they spend between one and two billion [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=220.88s)]
*  But they're gonna fight Trump every step of the way because it involves Donald Trump [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  Not the people of Massachusetts not the people of Boston [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=231.48s)]
*  So we'll see because also heard Griff Tom Holman is gonna take the land commissioner's offer in Texas [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  And he's gonna make that 1.4 million acres a place a holding area for the illegals to be rounded up and sent out [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=240.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the logistics are gonna be something we'll be covering extensively and it's not gonna be an easy task by any [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=249.56s)]
*  stretch of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=255.84s)]
*  Of the mind but one thing is for sure the will is there and this is what's gonna happen come some 40 days from now [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=256.84s)]
*  Thanks, you know the story shows that despite all of the references that they say [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=263.4s)]
*  What's wrong with the country that people want to come to America, which is a great thing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=270.52s)]
*  They want to come to America, but I think the frustration with America is not just a criminal element [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=273.12s)]
*  But we've got a lot of poor folks here [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=278.08s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people struggling and the fact that their legals have become a priority [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=280.16s)]
*  Versus the American citizens that are already struggling. Yeah, there's some [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=285.44s)]
*  Priorities that wages of the working class have been suppressed. That's right people coming across the border are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=290.32s)]
*  Undercutting the way [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=296.8s)]
*  And the New York Times addresses this in toward the end of the story they have to explain [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=298.32s)]
*  There's gonna be a problem they say but the high levels of immigration do have downsides including the pressure on society [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=303.72s)]
*  Social services and increased competition for jobs [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=310.0s)]
*  The CBO has concluded that wage growth for Americans who did not attend college [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=312.6s)]
*  Will be lower than it otherwise would have been for the next few years [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=317.0s)]
*  Because it would have been nice to get this report before the election [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=322.04s)]
*  On the 800% increase in Chinese nationals that have come over we talked a lot about the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=327.04s)]
*  Hispanics event as well, and you know, that was the China knows China knows and also, you know, we having this drone issue [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't know what's going on. We have eight we have what just in 2023 [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=338.12s)]
*  24,000 military age men [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=343.48s)]
*  We're from China were encountered by our border patrol. We don't know how many since then we don't know [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  You know how many you know what they're doing here [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=352.44s)]
*  But we know we have problems and Alejandro Mayorkas when I asked Carlos Jimenez [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=355.46s)]
*  Carlos Jimenez earlier in the show said who is the one person other than Joe Biden? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  What agency most responsible he said Alejandro Mayorkas? This is Homeland Security [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=365.24s)]
*  So as he's distracted dealing with this [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=369.0s)]
*  Created a crisis that he created along with Joe Biden [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  He can't protect us from drones or let us know what's going on Obama sent out four hundred thousand Trump [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUME4rPcdo&t=377.08000000000004s)]
