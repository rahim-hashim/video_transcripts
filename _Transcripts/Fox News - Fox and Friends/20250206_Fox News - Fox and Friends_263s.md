# Soros-backed radio station accused of broadcasting undercover ICE agents' locations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg)
*  So Elon Musk is trying to help balance our budget. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=0.0s)]
*  Apparently Democrats have a huge problem with that, but they don't seem to have a problem with another billionaire, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=3.0s)]
*  George Soros, and his son, whose money is funding a radio station, a series of radio stations that's been accused of broadcasting live locations, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=8.0s)]
*  by the way, in Colorado, undercover ICE agents, locations of them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=16.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, KCBS Radio in San Francisco reportedly told listeners on January 26, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=21.0s)]
*  get this, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are currently carrying out an operation on the east side of town. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=26.0s)]
*  The county's response network says agents in San Jose were in unmarked vehicles. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=32.0s)]
*  FCC chair Brendan Carr is going just now. He's running that probe. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=37.0s)]
*  Concerning to you, Brendan? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Look, I try to look on the bright side of things, and here I think that's the fact that we are having an unprecedented number of deportations taking place in this country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=43.0s)]
*  And for that, thank goodness for President Trump. Promises made, promises kept. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=52.0s)]
*  He came in and said he's the person that can not only secure the border, but deport people that are here illegally. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=56.0s)]
*  And he's carrying that out with unprecedented speed. Thanks to Secretary Noem, Tom Homan as well. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=61.0s)]
*  Here, this is really concerning. So what happened was you had ICE agents undercover doing operations in east San Jose, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=66.0s)]
*  in part of the town known for violent gang activity. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=72.0s)]
*  You had this radio station broadcasting the live location, identifying the unmarked vehicles that they were in. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=76.0s)]
*  And again, against the backdrop of Democrat leaders in Congress saying it's time for people to take fights to the street against Trump's agenda. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=82.0s)]
*  So we have sent a letter of inquiry, a formal investigation into that matter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=89.0s)]
*  And they have just a matter of days left to respond to that inquiry and explain how this could possibly be consistent with their public interest obligations. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=93.0s)]
*  And I should have called you chairman. I apologize for that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=100.0s)]
*  In terms of USAID funding and people are concerned about the spending here, if you want to know motivation, look at this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=103.0s)]
*  Three hundred seventy seven thousand dollars from USAID workers go to Democrats, twelve go to Republicans. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=109.0s)]
*  And you wonder if there's a political agenda there. At the very least, you have to understand you have to understand the concern. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah, when you look at USAID in particular, it has been operating as sort of a money laundering operation for all sorts of radical causes, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=122.0s)]
*  everything from promoting divisive DEI to actually helping to fund some of the censorship cartel operations that are taking place across the board. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=129.0s)]
*  So it's very interesting that this is the place where Democrats have decided to go to the ramparts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=138.0s)]
*  All right. And by the way, we reached out to Odyssey to get a statement on this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=143.0s)]
*  George Soros bought all those stations. You dissented from it. But now you're in charge. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=146.0s)]
*  Who knows if that would have went through if you were in charge. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=150.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the other big story is 60 minutes. And you said you have to turn over the transcripts of the vice president Kamala Harris's interview [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=153.0s)]
*  because of the way obviously it was edited and they're already being sued for 10 billion dollars by the Trump team. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=161.0s)]
*  Are you worried about the precedent of asking for these transcripts? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=168.0s)]
*  Because now everybody that has to edit down a interview with a high profile figure will have the same situation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=172.0s)]
*  No, not at all. What's actually interesting here is the precedent we're following is the precedent that the Democrat FCC set when it came to Fox. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=180.0s)]
*  There was a complaint lodged against Fox, and so they opened up a public proceeding on that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=187.0s)]
*  And we're simply applying that precedent. You know, look, there's a lot of people in this country right now on the radical left [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=191.0s)]
*  that are upset about this investigation into CBS and the work that I'm doing on broadcasters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=196.0s)]
*  And so I paraphrase Thomas Sowell, when the government has been weaponized in your favor, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=201.0s)]
*  it feels like discrimination when all of a sudden there's even-handed treatment. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=206.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have been on that sort of that upper road of the two-tiered system of government. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=209.0s)]
*  And what I'm here to do is apply the law evenly. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=214.0s)]
*  This is a rare situation where we had extrinsic evidence that CBS had played one answer or one set of words and then swapped in another set. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=216.0s)]
*  And CBS's conduct through this, frankly, has been concerning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=224.0s)]
*  You know, look, they just did an interview with Vice President Vance and immediately fully disclosed the unedited transcript. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=228.0s)]
*  For some reason, they decided not to do that in this case. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=234.0s)]
*  And so we've now opened a proceeding. We think it's in the public interest to allow people to participate in comment. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=237.0s)]
*  And we're going to take this one step at a time at the FCC. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=242.0s)]
*  And I hope we can talk to you pretty consistently, Chairman, because there's so much going on in media that really matters and it's changing so quickly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=244.0s)]
*  Brendan Kord, thanks so much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=251.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TQIz-zDJg&t=252.0s)]
