# Kamala is still losing to Trump: Katie Pavlich
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA)
*  A new matchup, but the same result. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Trump leading Harris by one point [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=2.2s)]
*  in this brand new Fox national poll. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=5.4s)]
*  And Trump also, excuse me, Trump also leading Harris [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=8.24s)]
*  by eight points amongst independent voters. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=11.44s)]
*  Americans also overwhelmingly turning to the former president [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=14.48s)]
*  on these top issues, on the economy, on border security, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=17.68s)]
*  as he's blasting Kamala Harris for embracing Bidenomics. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=20.64s)]
*  Kamala has declared that tackling inflation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=26.52s)]
*  will be a day one priority. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=29.44s)]
*  Just think of it, for her, but day one for Kamala [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  was three and a half years ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Why hasn't she done it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=38.64s)]
*  So here with reaction is Fox News contributor, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=41.0s)]
*  Katie Pavlich, hey Katie. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=42.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. Good to see you too. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=45.96s)]
*  Yeah, he makes a good point. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=47.64s)]
*  Everyone's kind of been making this point [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  across the network yesterday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=50.32s)]
*  She said, I'll fix it on day one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=52.6s)]
*  And then people are reminding her, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  no, you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=55.52s)]
*  What is her plan to do something different [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=58.24s)]
*  than she has already done in the past? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=60.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, when she says that she is willing [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=64.36s)]
*  to tackle inflation on day one, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=66.16s)]
*  that's like someone who lights a house on fire [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  and then conveniently calls the fire department [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=69.84s)]
*  and wants all of the credit for somehow saving the remnants [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=72.04s)]
*  of what they've destroyed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=75.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris was the last vote [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=77.28s)]
*  to get the Inflation Induction Act, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=79.72s)]
*  it's technically called the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=82.04s)]
*  over the finish line, which really boosted inflation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  and caused a lot of damage for Americans across the country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=87.84s)]
*  And when you look at this polling, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=91.12s)]
*  it's quite interesting to see [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  that with all of the honeymoon talk [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=93.64000000000001s)]
*  and all of the favorable coverage of Kamala Harris, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=95.64000000000001s)]
*  she still is losing to Donald Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  And when it comes to these swing states [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=100.76s)]
*  like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=102.4s)]
*  the number one issue for people is the economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=104.92000000000002s)]
*  And so you're gonna have these battling visions, I guess, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  if she ever comes out to speak about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  what her vision will be about how to move [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  the country forward, she's already copied President Trump [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=114.56s)]
*  on the no tax on tips issue, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  but it seems like she's gonna try to run away [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=119.0s)]
*  from Bidenomics in a way, but also embrace many [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=120.84s)]
*  of the far left policy positions by repackaging it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  to seem a little more palatable to independent voters [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=127.68s)]
*  in these swing states. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=130.78s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=131.62s)]
*  She's flip-flopping on a lot of her former voting record. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=132.44s)]
*  Yes, all of them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=136.04s)]
*  Issues, all of them, you're right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=136.88s)]
*  And she is copying Donald Trump on the no tax on tips. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=138.24s)]
*  Listen to what he said about that yesterday. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=141.8s)]
*  When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan this week, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=145.08s)]
*  probably will be a copy of my plan [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=148.72s)]
*  because basically that's what she does. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=150.68s)]
*  Just remember, she goes to work every morning [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=154.6s)]
*  in the West Wing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=157.0s)]
*  Her desk is 10 steps from the Oval Office. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=158.4s)]
*  She cast the tie-breaking votes [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=161.36s)]
*  that gave us record inflation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=163.16s)]
*  He also, Katie, doesn't wanna attack social security [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  and he called out yesterday how there's a double taxation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=167.76s)]
*  on that, it's not fair to Americans, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=170.76s)]
*  especially people on fixed incomes [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=172.32s)]
*  when they're getting those social security checks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=173.8s)]
*  But he made a joke, he said, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  there's probably a spy in here [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=176.84s)]
*  that's gonna tell Kamala Harris I'm doing that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=178.36s)]
*  and she'll probably copy me on that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  What's your reaction on her copying everything [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=181.84s)]
*  that he's doing or a lot of what he's doing? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=184.72s)]
*  Well, it's so interesting because if, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  far left policies that she has held, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=191.32000000000002s)]
*  not only just for over the past four years [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=193.56s)]
*  as the vice president to Joe Biden who ran as a moderate, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  but really has had one of those liberal presidencies [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=198.56s)]
*  in modern times. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=201.0s)]
*  But if you look at her record of running in 2019 and 2020, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=202.24s)]
*  if those policies were popular, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  they would not be running away from them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=208.12s)]
*  She would be embracing her quote, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=209.72s)]
*  principled stand on all of these issues. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  Instead, they're running a far away from them [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  because they don't sit well with the American people, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=216.24s)]
*  especially with the voters that she needs, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=219.24s)]
*  independents, people who are still haven't made up their minds [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=221.8s)]
*  in these places where they need that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=224.68s)]
*  to get over the finish line [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  in terms of the Electoral College. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=227.3s)]
*  So they're running away from it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=229.08s)]
*  And so interesting because while she's trying to strike out [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=230.48s)]
*  on her own and be her own candidate, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=234.76s)]
*  she's not just the vice president for Joe Biden. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=237.32s)]
*  She's her own woman, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=239.48s)]
*  wants to be the first female president of the United States. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  She's copying Donald Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  And the White House really is not letting her [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=244.72s)]
*  get away from Bidenomics. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  If you go to the WhiteHouse.gov [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=248.0s)]
*  and you put Bidenomics into the search bar, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=250.0s)]
*  you'll find dozens of posts, press releases [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  that say Biden-Harris administration, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=256.64s)]
*  and nobody should forget that they sent her out [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=259.24s)]
*  to do a number of events [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  where she very happily touted Bidenomics. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=262.96s)]
*  And so yesterday they were saying, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  oh no, she's been a partner with us. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  So she's trying to walk this line [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=269.96s)]
*  where she's endorsed the Biden agenda, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=271.32s)]
*  but somehow is different while also calling [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  for more regulation, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=275.44s)]
*  which will only create more costs for American families. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=276.84s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  She can't run away from her record. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=280.88s)]
*  We have it all on tape. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=281.86s)]
*  We have it in her own words. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=282.98s)]
*  Thank you so much, Katie, for coming on. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeQxmB3DhHA&t=285.71999999999997s)]
