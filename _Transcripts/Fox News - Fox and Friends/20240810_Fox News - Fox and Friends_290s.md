# Veteran slams Tim Walz as a ‘traitor’ of the US military: ‘Unforgiveable coward’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo)
*  Tim Walz's military record facing growing scrutiny since joining Kamala Harris on the ticket. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=0.0s)]
*  And now the campaign is caught tweaking his military bio. How convenient. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=8.0s)]
*  The campaign website originally called Walz a, quote, retired command sergeant major. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=13.0s)]
*  But now it says served as a command sergeant major, which I guess is technically correct for a moment. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=18.0s)]
*  After reports that he was reduced in rank for not completing his coursework before retirement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=25.0s)]
*  Our next guest is calling out Walz for embellishing his service and says he abandoned his unit right before they deployed to a war zone. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=31.0s)]
*  Command, real command sergeant major Thomas Barron joins us now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=39.0s)]
*  Sergeant Major, thank you very much for being here. I want to clear something up real quick because you knew Master Sergeant Walz. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=44.0s)]
*  You deployed with this unit. You know all this. It's not a big world of command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=51.0s)]
*  I served with the Red Bulls. It's a great unit. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=57.0s)]
*  Was the unit aware when Walz retired, was the unit aware that this deployment was coming? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=61.0s)]
*  Because some on the left are saying, well, he didn't have his orders, so he didn't know. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=67.0s)]
*  He knew full well that there was a deployment coming, correct? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=70.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And he even said it himself in his campaign announcement that came out in March of 2005. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=74.0s)]
*  I didn't find this out until just a couple of days ago either, but he actually filed with the Federal Election Commission on February 10th to run for Congress of 2005. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=85.0s)]
*  And then March, he actually had his campaign wrote, as command sergeant major, I have a responsibility not only to be ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=95.0s)]
*  I'm dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington, D.C. or in Iraq. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=108.0s)]
*  He continued adding, I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I'm deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=114.0s)]
*  I'm fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=122.0s)]
*  Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=128.0s)]
*  And this was actually on CNN. I mean, it's him admitting right there he knew in March that they were going to go to Iraq. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=134.0s)]
*  It's his own word. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=142.0s)]
*  CSM, you know, I would liken this to a coach, you know, coaching a team for 24 years and then you're finally in the Super Bowl and the Super Bowl is coming and the coach says, no, I'm out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=145.0s)]
*  I'm done. What does it say? What kind of message does it send to a unit when a command sergeant major? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=154.0s)]
*  I mean, command sergeant majors are a big deal. They block the sun. Like they're the most important enlisted member of that unit. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=160.0s)]
*  When a command sergeant major bails on a deployment beforehand, what kind of message does that send? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=166.0s)]
*  The message that it sends to me is, you know, turn around and run and just keep running. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=172.0s)]
*  I mean, go crawl under a rock, get the hell out of here. Nobody even wants to mention your name again. You're soiled. You're basically a traitor. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=178.0s)]
*  You deserted your unit. You're a deserter at that point. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=185.0s)]
*  I mean, the analogy you have right there is very, very good because I mentioned that with my family. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=188.0s)]
*  It was like this is like training for the Super Bowl and then you're one game away and then Tom Brady says, I'm sorry, I don't want to get hurt in this game. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=196.0s)]
*  So you go you go play for me. It's just absolutely ridiculous. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=204.0s)]
*  There's no, you know, they're unforgivable, coward. I mean, you can come up with words out there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=208.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just unbelievable. What percentage real quick, we're almost out of time here sergeant major. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=215.0s)]
*  What percentage of the guys who went on that deployment feel the same way about walls would would would echo your feelings? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=219.0s)]
*  I would guess that it's got to be in the 98, 99 percent. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=225.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple out there that have spoken out and and said, how can you do this to the to the guy and whatever? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=228.0s)]
*  But he did it to himself. I mean, all I am is the messenger. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=233.0s)]
*  He made the message and I, you know, and it was like it needed to get brought out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=236.0s)]
*  And I just happened to be the one that God said, you know, you you're too dumb to keep your mouth shut. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=239.0s)]
*  So go spread the word. Good for you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=244.0s)]
*  Always leading from the front, still doing it today. By the way, you spoke out years ago about this, but the Minnesota press is even worse than the national press. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=247.0s)]
*  They're unwilling to cover this stuff, so they covered up for walls for a very long time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=253.0s)]
*  Now other outlets are willing to amplify what you've been saying for a long time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=257.0s)]
*  Command Sergeant Major Thomas Farrans. By the way, people don't know this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=261.0s)]
*  This Minnesota Guard unit, it's called the long tour for a reason. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=264.0s)]
*  It was a six month pre-mob, a 12 month deployment and then a six month or four month extension on that deployment. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=267.0s)]
*  That unit was gone for almost two years in service of this country and saw heavy combat. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=273.0s)]
*  He bailed on that. Your men did not. Command Sergeant Major, thank you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=277.0s)]
*  Here's to the Red Bulls. I recognize that Red Bull mug right there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=281.0s)]
*  We're probably on my shoulder before. Thank you, Sergeant Major. Great to see you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=284.0s)]
*  You have a great day. You too. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7uuQdDrKo&t=287.0s)]
