# Family of American held by Taliban reveals 'devastating' phone call with Biden
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU)
*  Today, President Biden is set to deliver his final foreign policy address one week before [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=6.18s)]
*  While Biden tries to define his legacy, one family, there's their picture, is fighting [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=8.38s)]
*  to bring home an American hostage being held by the Taliban. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Ryan Corbett has been trapped in Afghanistan since 2022, but his family hasn't heard anything [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=17.04s)]
*  from Joe Biden until just yesterday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=23.38s)]
*  Biden's wife, Anna Corbett, joins us now exclusively after that conversation with President Biden. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=26.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Anna. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=31.62s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=33.54s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=35.5s)]
*  I can't imagine what you're going through. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=36.5s)]
*  I know that you have made 16 trips to Washington, D.C. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  Speaker Johnson invited you and your three children to the State of the Union Address [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=41.1s)]
*  and you were there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=44.5s)]
*  You helped pass two resolutions, hopefully to bring Ryan home. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=45.6s)]
*  But you just heard from President Biden yesterday, despite your efforts. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=49.5s)]
*  He's been trying to get in touch with him for a long time, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=52.86s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=55.42s)]
*  I've been asking for a meeting. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=56.42s)]
*  I was told and promised I would meet with him directly. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=58.58s)]
*  And just on Friday, I was given the news that I would have a short call with him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=62.14s)]
*  And that happened yesterday. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=68.22s)]
*  What was that conversation like? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=70.26s)]
*  He was very kind and empathetic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=73.1s)]
*  But what I heard him say is that he is not bringing Ryan home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=75.58s)]
*  That was absolutely devastating, because as you just said, I have been advocating fiercely [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=80.98s)]
*  on Ryan's behalf, on my family's behalf. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=86.46s)]
*  Ryan just keeps missing milestones. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=88.94s)]
*  And he should be part of teaching Caleb how to hunt. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=92.22s)]
*  Caleb shot his first buck last year without Ryan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=97.14s)]
*  And Katia was voted prom queen without Ryan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=101.62s)]
*  And Katia graduated from high school without Ryan. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=105.32s)]
*  And it is getting too long. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=108.2s)]
*  To hear after all this effort that there is a deal on the table, there is a way to bring [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=110.78s)]
*  Ryan home and it's not being taken is incredibly crushing to our family. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=116.26s)]
*  Yeah, Anna, there were reports that surfaced last week about a deal to trade three American [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=121.62s)]
*  hostages, one including Ryan, for one of the prisoners at Gitmo with ties to Osama bin [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=126.14s)]
*  Laden. I know that you went down to Palm Beach. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=131.7s)]
*  You're from New York. You went down to Palm Beach. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=134.26s)]
*  You camped out in front of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=136.02s)]
*  And Donald Trump got word that you were there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=138.02s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=140.06s)]
*  I have been down here for a couple of days and I have heard from several that President [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=143.18s)]
*  Trump is concerned about our family. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=151.26s)]
*  He knows that we are down here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=153.38s)]
*  He knows about our situation and is very concerned. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=155.7s)]
*  And amazingly, yesterday he sent his incoming national security adviser to meet with me [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  where I was. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=166.82s)]
*  And incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz actually gave us more than an hour just [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=167.94s)]
*  listening to our story and hearing about the situation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  It was just mind blowing because it took 16 months to actually get a meeting where I [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=179.18s)]
*  traveled to D.C. to meet with the current national national security adviser Jake Sullivan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=184.5s)]
*  And this shows that President Trump is very concerned, is wanting to prioritize our family. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=190.78s)]
*  I know he's tough. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=198.1s)]
*  He wants to make deals. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=199.22s)]
*  And I am extremely encouraged. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=200.86s)]
*  And the contrast of my experience is just mind blowing right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=204.14s)]
*  Yes, I want to hear about Ryan's story. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=208.94s)]
*  But what did the conversation with Michael Waltz, how did that go? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=211.06s)]
*  Are you getting a feeling that they will bring him home during this administration? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=214.06s)]
*  I absolutely believe they will bring Ryan home. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  The details, of course, are unclear. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=222.14s)]
*  This is complicated. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=224.5s)]
*  And I'm not an expert in any of this, but it's very clear that the incoming administration [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  cares about bringing U.S. citizens back to their country and caring about Ryan and George, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=233.38s)]
*  who is also held with him, who have done nothing wrong. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=240.26s)]
*  They've been designated as wrongfully detained and accused of nothing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=243.26s)]
*  They deserve to be in their own country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=247.12s)]
*  Ryan's a patriot. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  Tell me your Ryan story. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=251.04s)]
*  What happened? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=252.04s)]
*  I know he was there on a 12-month visa and he was returning there, I think, to help train [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=253.04s)]
*  the staff of a business that he started there in Afghanistan in 2017. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  He and a coworker, a colleague from Germany, they were both captured. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=261.16s)]
*  What happened to him and how is he doing? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=265.68s)]
*  Have you gotten word? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=266.96s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=269.6s)]
*  So he has been held now for 886 days. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=270.6s)]
*  We lived in Afghanistan as a family. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=273.6s)]
*  We left the people and had to evacuate when the Taliban took over. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=276.28s)]
*  But Ryan kept his business open and that's why he returned to Afghanistan. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  And we have had contact about every two weeks, short calls. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's very difficult because his conditions are not livable. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=290.28s)]
*  He is physically declining. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=295.4s)]
*  He told me on a call that I would not recognize him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  And I spoke with him yesterday. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  He called us at 530. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  I never know exactly when he will call and to be woken up by this type of call. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=304.84s)]
*  I never know what he's going to say. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  And he was extremely frustrated that he is still being held and he wants to come home [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  and be with his family. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=318.56s)]
*  He's an amazing dad. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=319.96s)]
*  And he said, I feel bad for all that you're having to do for me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  And of course, I will do everything I can. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=326.52s)]
*  I'm a mom. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=329.08s)]
*  This is what moms do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=330.08s)]
*  And I want my children to have their dad back to be part of their lives. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=331.92s)]
*  Yeah, Anna, we're all praying for you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  Everyone watching, say a prayer that we can bring Ryan home safely so that he can be a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=339.0s)]
*  father and a husband. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  You clearly are an amazing wife. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=344.6s)]
*  He's so blessed to have you in his life. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=346.32s)]
*  You're a fighter. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  Keep fighting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much, Anna. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tcYsRpH8UU&t=351.20000000000005s)]
