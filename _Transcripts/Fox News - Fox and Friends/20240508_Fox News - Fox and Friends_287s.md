# Biden admin pauses key weapons shipment to Israel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA)
*  Fox News, Lord. Now the White House is confirming, confirming it's holding back a key shipment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=0.0s)]
*  of about 3500 bombs to Israel over the concerns they'll be used in RAFA. It comes as negotiations [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=5.7s)]
*  for both Israel and Hamas. Negotiators have arrived in Cairo to work out a possible ceasefire [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=12.38s)]
*  agreement with them there as the CIA director here in America. Fox News foreign correspondent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=19.82s)]
*  Trey Yanks has been covering the war from day one and he begins his day with us. Trey, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=25.46s)]
*  great to see you. Great to see you, Brian. Your reaction to the U.S. stopping this weapon [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=30.26s)]
*  shipment that was on its way. So look, we're talking about 500 pound bombs and 2000 pound [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=35.5s)]
*  bombs. These are explosives the Israelis have been using in Gaza since the war erupted following [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  the October 7th massacre against Israelis. And they are bombs that have been quite controversial [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=48.0s)]
*  in this war because they have led to the deaths of civilians. But the Israelis will [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=53.82s)]
*  point to the fact that they're wrapping up their operation inside Gaza. RAFA is the last [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=57.38s)]
*  stronghold of Hamas. It's the last area that hasn't been cleared by the Israelis. And [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=62.18s)]
*  many of these bombs aren't planned to be used inside Gaza, but rather in Lebanon when what [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=66.5s)]
*  Israeli officials say is an operation that must happen will take place to clear Hezbollah [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=71.78s)]
*  back from the northern border. It looks like it consists of 800 pound bombs, 2000 pound [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=76.82s)]
*  bombs as well as 1700, 500 pound bombs. So that you said they need them for Hezbollah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=82.62s)]
*  And today you said there's already been operations against Hezbollah outside Beirut. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  Following the October 7th massacre, Hezbollah got directly involved in the fight, launching [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=95.22s)]
*  drones and missiles and rockets into northern Israel. And they've been doing that ever since. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=98.98s)]
*  And so the past seven months have seen not only nearly 100,000 Israelis evacuated from [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=104.18s)]
*  the northern border, but also constant fire into northern Israel, drawing Israeli responses. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=109.1s)]
*  So overnight there were new airstrikes in southern Lebanon amid that conflict. Just [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=114.46s)]
*  to seal up, your defense minister over in Israel, Golan, says we're going into RAFA. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=118.86s)]
*  The Secretary of State Blinken has said twice, we do not support you in Darafa. I mean, how [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  does this get resolved? The Israelis say they need strength to negotiate with these people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=131.1s)]
*  in Cairo and in Doha, and they will continue to operate in the southernmost city of RAFA. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=136.62s)]
*  The question here is what do they do with the Palestinian civilians that are currently [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=142.62s)]
*  sheltering there? Since the beginning of the war, they've told Palestinians to evacuate [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  to the south. They've now reached the Egyptian border. There are an estimated 1.5 million [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=149.26s)]
*  Palestinians in RAFA. And these evacuation orders that we saw just 48 hours ago only [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=153.62s)]
*  account for 100,000 of those Palestinians. When you find out, and it becomes public that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  the U.S. and Israel are sparring, that there are demonstrations here in America pro-Hamas, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=163.22s)]
*  pro-Palestine, how does that affect negotiations and operations in Gaza? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=168.14s)]
*  There's clearly pressure on the Biden administration to make decisions as it relates to Israel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=176.77999999999997s)]
*  because it's a story that's playing out here in the United States. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=181.26s)]
*  Doesn't it give Hamas a sense they're winning? In the PR war? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=183.98s)]
*  When it comes to the information war that is running parallel to this conflict on the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  ground, but something that the Middle East understands that maybe some in the United [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=191.1s)]
*  States don't when you look at college campuses is the difference between being pro-Palestinian [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=194.82s)]
*  and the idea of a two-state solution that could lead toward peace in the Middle East [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=199.14s)]
*  and being pro-Hamas. And those are two very different things that are playing out here [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=203.22s)]
*  in the United States on these college campuses and in the Middle East. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  And the biggest story is they only understand strength in the region. This administration [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  seems to have a hard time understanding that. And the other thing is the major threat is [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=213.9s)]
*  that Iran could be a week away from a nuclear weapon. How does that affect what the prime [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=218.42s)]
*  minister does? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=222.62s)]
*  Absolutely. When the Israelis are making these calculations about the weapons that they need, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=223.74s)]
*  they're not just looking at Gaza's southernmost city of Ra'a. They're looking at southern [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=227.34s)]
*  Lebanon with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. They're looking at the Iran-backed Houthis [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=231.46s)]
*  in Yemen. They're looking at the Iranian-backed Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias that are operating [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=235.54s)]
*  across the region. And then of course Iran itself that launched hundreds of ballistic [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=240.98s)]
*  missiles and drones toward Israel as we reported on the ground last month. And so the Israelis [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=244.98s)]
*  are concerned about the possibility that Iran goes to that nuclear breakout and ultimately [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=250.02s)]
*  creates a weapon that they use against the Jewish state. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=254.5s)]
*  And how are you doing? You went from Ukraine to Israel. You're in the middle of a war since [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=256.9s)]
*  October 7th. How are you handling all this? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=261.42s)]
*  I'm doing well. We're focused on the mission to get this story out to our audience and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=263.86s)]
*  we'll continue to do it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=267.18s)]
*  Right. You going back? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=268.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=269.18s)]
*  Going back tonight. All right, Trey, you probably won't be wearing a suit for a while. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=270.18s)]
*  No. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=272.7s)]
*  We're going to continue in the field to do a fantastic job and everybody knows it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E157zwbw5VA&t=273.7s)]
