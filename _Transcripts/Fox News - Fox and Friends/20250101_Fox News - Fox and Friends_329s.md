# Trump aide behind iconic moments promoted to 'executive producer'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA)
*  And apparently one of the people that was most responsible [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=0.0s)]
*  for those good ideas, all the way from the RNC [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  to Madison Square Garden to again, the McDonald's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=5.2s)]
*  and the garbage truck is this guy named Justin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=8.02s)]
*  and I'm Caparol. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=10.92s)]
*  Caparol. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=12.52s)]
*  Caparol. Caparol. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=13.36s)]
*  And so I wanna read this true social post [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=14.32s)]
*  that Trump put out yesterday [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=16.6s)]
*  because he's getting a promotion. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=17.48s)]
*  He's getting a permanent job in the administration. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=19.36s)]
*  It says, Justin Caparol has been with me [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=21.56s)]
*  from the very beginning, a very incredible journey, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=24.16s)]
*  helping to produce our historic rallies and events, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  including the RNC, Madison Square Garden, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=29.76s)]
*  McDonald's commercial, and even my seriously viral [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=33.0s)]
*  garbage truck ride. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=37.72s)]
*  Once he finishes what will be a magnificent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  inauguration presentation, Justin will continue to serve [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=41.14s)]
*  as my external operations as executive producer [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=44.24s)]
*  for major events and public appearances. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=49.06s)]
*  Congratulations, Justin. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=51.36s)]
*  Keep up the great work. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=52.84s)]
*  And you know, from my memory, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=53.84s)]
*  he didn't really ever stop having rallies [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=56.52s)]
*  after he was elected in 2016. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=58.92s)]
*  He continued to have, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=60.92s)]
*  so there might be a lot of opportunity for Justin [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=62.4s)]
*  to keep doing what he's doing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=64.76s)]
*  Oh, go ahead. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=66.28s)]
*  I was gonna say, there's two things. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=67.12s)]
*  First of all, I do love that President-elect Trump [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=68.0s)]
*  is continuing to post on Truth Social [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=70.54s)]
*  and then sometimes they get over to X [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=72.92s)]
*  because this is one of the reasons why he connects [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  to the American people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=76.58s)]
*  It's obvious he is writing these posts [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=77.44s)]
*  as opposed to President Biden's X posts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=79.84s)]
*  You never knew who was writing that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=83.48s)]
*  Certainly never sounded like him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=85.08s)]
*  He again is speaking directly to the American people. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=86.56s)]
*  And then on top of that, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=89.6s)]
*  obviously he worked the media perfectly, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=91.24s)]
*  which was a huge driving force behind his 2024 campaign. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=93.84s)]
*  So I think Justin producing some of these massive events [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=97.92s)]
*  that clearly garnished a lot of attention [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  and I think kept that momentum going [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=104.28s)]
*  during the election cycle. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=106.28s)]
*  This is probably a very well-deserved promotion for him [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  and congratulations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=110.58s)]
*  Justin Kepral is gonna do great things. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=111.6s)]
*  And I have so much to say about this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=114.02s)]
*  As someone who was an executive producer [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=115.96s)]
*  before being on the air [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=117.8s)]
*  and the job of an executive producer is so daunting. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  You've gotta basically just come up with magic [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  from nothing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  And in the case, if you remember the interview [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=126.6s)]
*  with the guy that brought the garbage truck, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=128.84s)]
*  he got a phone call that morning and said, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=131.44s)]
*  I'm not sure, can you get a good truck? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  I found a truck. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=137.0s)]
*  And then he confessed about halfway through the morning, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=137.84s)]
*  he realized this is going to Donald Trump, my goodness. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=140.62s)]
*  And that's what the executive producer does. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=144.44s)]
*  They like, you know what we could do? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=146.24s)]
*  Here's an idea, get a garbage truck, put Trump in it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=147.44s)]
*  But someone's gotta execute that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=150.56s)]
*  They gotta pull it off and Justin Kepral did that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=152.24s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=154.6s)]
*  It reminds me guys back in, remember Lee Atwater, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=155.44s)]
*  the late Lee Atwater, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=158.88s)]
*  who was the genius behind Ronald Reagan's photo ops. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=160.0s)]
*  And it gave Reagan these iconic moments [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=163.36s)]
*  and Lee Atwater played a big instrumental role [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=166.24s)]
*  in positioning those and letting the public [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=169.14s)]
*  see these moments. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=172.28s)]
*  Justin Kepral is going next level with this stuff. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=173.48s)]
*  In fact, I think we have a montage a little bit [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=176.76s)]
*  of Trump in the garbage truck in the McDonald's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=178.76s)]
*  to remind our viewers how those events [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  and moments played out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=183.92s)]
*  I feel like my garbage truck, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  this truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=188.28s)]
*  My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=191.92s)]
*  You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, I want to thank [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  all of our incredible sanitation workers [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=202.0s)]
*  all across America. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=204.76s)]
*  Because they work hard. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=206.16s)]
*  They really do work hard and they do an incredible job [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=215.32s)]
*  and they don't get the credit they deserve [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=219.4s)]
*  like our police, like our firefighters, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=221.72s)]
*  like so many others. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=224.68s)]
*  Thank you Mr. President. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=225.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=227.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=228.6s)]
*  You made it possible for ordinary people like us [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=229.6s)]
*  to meet you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=232.48s)]
*  You're not ordinary. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=233.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=234.16s)]
*  You are not ordinary. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=235.0s)]
*  I can see. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  We pray for you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, you actually have worked [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  at McDonald's now versus. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  Now I have worked at McDonald's. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=241.12s)]
*  I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  Such a great line. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=247.48s)]
*  I think what makes those two moments specifically, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=248.44s)]
*  not just viral, but what made them resonate with people [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=251.2s)]
*  is this idea that this man specifically, Donald Trump, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  before the presidency, his attention to detail [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=256.84s)]
*  on how he presents himself is infamous. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=260.08s)]
*  To the point that he has a uniform. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=263.11999999999995s)]
*  He has a blue suit with a red tie. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=264.67999999999995s)]
*  When it's a serious event, that's what he's wearing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=266.08s)]
*  He's gonna have his tan 12 months a year. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=267.88s)]
*  He cares about how he's perceived from his shoes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  up to his hair and it's become his brand. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=274.4s)]
*  For him to put on that reflective vest [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=277.23999999999995s)]
*  or for him to put on that McDonald's apron, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=280.84s)]
*  it elevated the dignity of people that do those jobs. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  It elevated the dignity of that uniform. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=285.52s)]
*  It's this idea that this guy who is so meticulous [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=287.88s)]
*  and so such, I don't wanna say perfectionist, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=290.34s)]
*  but so particular about how he presents himself, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=292.68s)]
*  he's willing to wear their uniform, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=296.12s)]
*  to take pictures, stand in front of a crowd, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAJoG08uVQA&t=298.08s)]
