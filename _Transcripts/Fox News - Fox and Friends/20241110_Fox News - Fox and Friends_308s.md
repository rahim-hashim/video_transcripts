# Biden set to meet with Trump at White House after 2024 victory
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo)
*  Well, on Wednesday, Joe Biden and President-elect Trump will meet at the White House to mark [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=0.0s)]
*  the start of the transfer of power. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=8.86s)]
*  As Trump returns to the Oval Office, the focus is now on who will be joining him in his cabinet. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=11.58s)]
*  Our next guest says she'd be honored, quote, honored to serve if asked. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=15.94s)]
*  Trump transition team co-chair Tulsi Gabbard joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=20.36s)]
*  I want to ask you, how will you serve? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  I know you're not going to answer me, so I guess I want to ask just a general question. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=26.9s)]
*  It's very clear from the statement that Donald Trump put out on True Social yesterday where [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=34.76s)]
*  he said, I'm not going to have, who was it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=38.44s)]
*  Nikki Haley. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  Nikki Haley, I'm sorry. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  Nikki Haley and Pompeo, thank you very much. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Long show. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=47.44s)]
*  And then he put that out, which is not very traditional. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=48.44s)]
*  And there seems to be like a battle inside, like whose ideological views are going to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=53.38s)]
*  show up in this administration? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  Tell me what the criteria are that you're seeing on the transition team, how you're [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  processing people's names and resumes through. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=66.22s)]
*  And also just how important is loyalty in this? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  People who have stood by the president for a long time, through thick and thin. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=73.26s)]
*  You know, yeah, sure. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, President Trump is obviously going through and making these decisions very carefully. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=79.72s)]
*  What we saw on election night was this very, very clear mandate coming from the American [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=85.68s)]
*  people, this overwhelming victory that was a resounding rejection of the neocon warmongers [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=90.64s)]
*  who like to see our country in a constant state of war, who support feeding the military [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=98.36s)]
*  industrial complex. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  It was a resounding rejection of the Washington establishment that puts their own power over [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=104.54s)]
*  the interests of the people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=111.12s)]
*  So President Trump is coming into this with the majority of the American people standing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=113.64s)]
*  alongside him. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  And those who he is bringing with him into this administration, I can assure you, will [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  be people who are committed to executing his vision, his promise to the American people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  So a lot of people talk about loyalty and how important loyalty is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=131.28s)]
*  Yes, well, it's loyalty to the American people, making sure that the policies that President [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=134.9s)]
*  Trump has outlined throughout his campaign that his administration will execute will [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=140.8s)]
*  always be made within that context that he has talked about since 2016 is putting the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=145.18s)]
*  interests of the American people first. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=150.28s)]
*  Yeah, America first. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=152.82s)]
*  You know, Tulsi, before you became a Republican in the course of this race, have been a longtime [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=154.9s)]
*  supporter of Donald Trump throughout. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=159.14s)]
*  Yep, you used to be a Democrat and Nancy Pelosi and others have been trying to point fingers [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=161.18s)]
*  at each other, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=167.06s)]
*  Rather than then rather than realize that they've lost touch with the American people, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=168.06s)]
*  you've got Nancy Pelosi, you've got other Democrats saying, well, we are the party, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=172.06s)]
*  the working class. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=175.82s)]
*  We do. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=176.82s)]
*  They're playing the blame game. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=177.82s)]
*  Can they learn anything? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=178.82s)]
*  You understand that mindset, although you completely rejected it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=180.22s)]
*  Can they learn? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=184.94s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=187.78s)]
*  You know, when President Trump won in 2016, I remember going back to Washington thinking [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=188.98s)]
*  like, oh, OK, maybe the leaders of the Democrat Party are going to have a moment of introspection [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  and ask themselves like, OK, what are we getting wrong? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=198.62s)]
*  Because the American people clearly rejected the Democrat leadership of Hillary Clinton [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=201.22s)]
*  and chose Donald Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=205.98s)]
*  It didn't happen then. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=207.7s)]
*  It has not happened since. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=208.94s)]
*  And as you can see here, it's not happening now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=211.34s)]
*  It's very revealing in how they're reacting to President Trump's win of the popular vote, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=214.22s)]
*  win of the electoral vote, in that they still think we, the American people, are stupid. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=219.62s)]
*  They still think we are garbage. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=225.58s)]
*  And we can see this by them calling us that, essentially, calling those of us who supported [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=228.22s)]
*  President Trump and who voted for him as, you know, we're Nazis, we're racists, we're [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=234.94s)]
*  sexists, we're bigots. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=239.66s)]
*  After the election, they're doing this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  And then you see how little they think of our democracy when you see people like Governor [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=242.78s)]
*  Gavin Newsom and other Democrat governors saying, well, we have to Trump-proof our states [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=246.3s)]
*  to protect their states from the duly elected president of the United States. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=252.74s)]
*  They do not believe in democracy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  As much as they say they're the defenders of democracy, their very actions say, no, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=260.7s)]
*  no, no, they don't believe in democracy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  They don't believe in the voices of the people carrying the day through our elections. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=266.3s)]
*  They believe in their own power, their own radical agenda that Kamala Harris showed over [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=270.94s)]
*  the last four years has been disastrous for the American people, both here and domestic [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=275.42s)]
*  policy as well as their foreign policy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=279.82s)]
*  Well, Tulsi Gabbard, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=281.54s)]
*  There's been a lot of conversation, which you know the relationships behind the scenes [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=284.94s)]
*  on who is going to be saddled with the blame for what just went down. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  But thanks. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for your time, Tulsi. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  Have a great day. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTPadHemxpo&t=296.26s)]
