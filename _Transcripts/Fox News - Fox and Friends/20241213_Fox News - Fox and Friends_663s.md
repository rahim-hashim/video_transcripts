# Blue city mayors reversing course on Trump resistance, meeting with Homan
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=0.0s)]
*  The district attorney prosecuting the illegal migrants [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=1.84s)]
*  accused of killing 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungery [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=5.0s)]
*  making an exclusive announcement earlier [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=8.0s)]
*  right here on Fox and Friends. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=10.28s)]
*  We'll be filing notice by the state of Texas [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=13.24s)]
*  that we intend to seek the death penalty [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=16.76s)]
*  against Jocelyn's murderers, Pena and Rangel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=19.28s)]
*  Both were Venezuelan nationals. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=23.36s)]
*  They had been captured while committing a crime [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=25.14s)]
*  coming into this country illegally. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=27.740000000000002s)]
*  And then within days of murdering and raping [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=29.76s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungery. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=34.68s)]
*  So we are seeking death because we want the message out there [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=37.44s)]
*  that regardless of who you are, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=41.52s)]
*  but especially if you are illegally in this country, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  that you will face the same consequences as anyone else [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=47.24s)]
*  for murdering a child [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=50.44s)]
*  during the course of raping and kidnapping her. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=52.18000000000001s)]
*  That announcement just moments ago here on Fox. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=54.92s)]
*  Back in June, 12-year-old Jocelyn was found, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=57.68s)]
*  strangled and assaulted as you just heard the DSA [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=60.8s)]
*  in a shallow creek near Houston, Texas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=64.04s)]
*  We covered this story. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=66.72s)]
*  Days after her body was found, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=67.76s)]
*  police arrested two Venezuelan illegal migrants [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=69.12s)]
*  who are also suspected members of Trendy Aragua gang, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=72.16s)]
*  as you know, TDG. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=75.64s)]
*  So both of those suspects are in jail [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=77.28s)]
*  with a $10 million bond for each. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  They have pledged not guilty. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=81.64s)]
*  Remember, they were working at construction site. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=84.48s)]
*  Remember? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=86.24s)]
*  And they had found a way, I guess, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=87.08s)]
*  had enough paperwork in order to start working. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=88.92s)]
*  But this is what they did. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=91.58s)]
*  This is Texas, this is Texas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=92.6s)]
*  You can't get away with stuff like this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=94.24s)]
*  in these Southern states, in these red states. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  The little girl was 12 years old. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  If you're a human being, not just a parent, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=100.46s)]
*  that means probably seventh grade. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=103.16s)]
*  Seventh grade and they raped her and then killed her. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  So Lawrence, you're from Texas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=108.58s)]
*  Explain if you will. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=110.66s)]
*  That area, they've had a lot of Democrat mayors [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  over the last period of time, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=115.78s)]
*  but it's not a sanctuary city. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=117.5s)]
*  Explain why. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=119.48s)]
*  Well, it's illegal to be a sanctuary city [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  in the state of Texas. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=122.04s)]
*  Not only will you not get funding, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=123.02s)]
*  but essentially they passed a state law [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  in a state of Texas saying you can't be a sanctuary. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=126.7s)]
*  So the governor and the legislature did away with that, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=129.38s)]
*  but it is still a red line. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=132.58s)]
*  I mean, she is in Houston. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=134.28s)]
*  All Democrats from Houston, Texas, very progressive, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=136.02s)]
*  but she's from the state of Texas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=139.96s)]
*  She understands the voters and they just don't like this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=141.62s)]
*  So not only is she going after illegals within, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=145.16s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't just the criminal elements. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=147.9s)]
*  She's saying they are not welcome in the city of Houston [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=150.0s)]
*  and going against her party by seeking the death penalty. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=154.04s)]
*  Remember the party at large is against capital murder. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=156.88s)]
*  So the D.A. is a Democrat? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=159.84s)]
*  Yes, she is a Democrat. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=161.28s)]
*  And she said, crime knows no party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=162.24s)]
*  Crime knows no party. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=165.76s)]
*  Here's more. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=167.06s)]
*  We base these decisions on the strength of the evidence [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=170.56s)]
*  and the gruesomeness of this crime. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=173.16s)]
*  And yes, I've spoken with Alexis Nungare [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=175.32s)]
*  multiple times along with her father. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=179.4s)]
*  Their family is supportive of this move. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=181.84s)]
*  The Democratic policies of open borders [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=185.12s)]
*  have failed the American public. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  If the Justice for Jocelyn Act filed by Senator Ted Cruz [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  or any of the policies that President-elect Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=194.28s)]
*  is pushing had been in effect, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=196.84s)]
*  then it's likely that Jocelyn Nungare [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=199.56s)]
*  would be alive today. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=202.24s)]
*  These types of horrific crimes committed [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=204.36s)]
*  by illegal immigrants crossing our border have to stop. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  The family of Jocelyn is in a position [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  they never dreamed would happen to them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's unfair for anybody with children [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  to be subject to criminals committing horrific crimes [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=222.46s)]
*  that don't have to happen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  If these fellows hadn't been in our country, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  Jocelyn would be alive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=232.6s)]
*  If the border patrol had continued to keep them in custody [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=233.44s)]
*  as Senator Cruz's bill would have required, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=238.56s)]
*  Jocelyn would be alive. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  So what really gets at prosecutors [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  and gets to me about this case is that it was preventable. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=245.0s)]
*  She's absolutely right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=249.76s)]
*  And Lawrence, you were talking a little bit [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=251.04s)]
*  about how it is illegal in the state of Texas [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=252.6s)]
*  to have a sanctuary city. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=255.76s)]
*  Glenn Yonkin, there's a great story [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=257.4s)]
*  on FoxNews.com right now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=258.88s)]
*  Glenn Yonkin, who is the governor [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=260.32s)]
*  of the Commonwealth of Virginia, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  he is introducing a budget proposal [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  to essentially create a sanctuary city ban in Virginia. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  Because if you are a sanctuary city in Virginia, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=271.96s)]
*  essentially it would cut off state funds to the city [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  if you do not cooperate with ICE. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=280.08s)]
*  That is a sea change from what has been going on down there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's also reflective of just ever since [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=286.5s)]
*  Donald Trump was elected and Tom Homan was designated [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=289.44s)]
*  the border czar, there's been a sea change [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=292.76s)]
*  in the United States regarding migrants. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=295.48s)]
*  A lot of people, they looked at the polls, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=297.68s)]
*  they realized this was a big issue. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=300.08s)]
*  People don't like so many people here [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=301.68s)]
*  who are in the country illegally, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=303.64s)]
*  and many have committed crime, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=305.16s)]
*  and they're finally doing something about it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=307.0s)]
*  Ainsley, this has become just the common sense [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  of the American people right here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=312.08s)]
*  You can't have criminals, you can't have people [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=314.0s)]
*  just crossing the border, unvetted, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=315.6s)]
*  we don't know who they are, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=317.96s)]
*  and tragically we have a young girl, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=319.44s)]
*  life totally ahead of her, raped and murdered. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=326.2s)]
*  And it's because of Joe Biden's immigration policy [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  that allowed him to get here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=329.23999999999995s)]
*  We're smarter than this as a country, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=332.56s)]
*  and I think the American people, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  they voiced that at the polls in November. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  We know when you see the faces of Jocelyn, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=339.76s)]
*  or you see the faces like Lake and Riley, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  her killer too would have been behind bars [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=345.88s)]
*  if this weren't a sanctuary city, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=348.32s)]
*  and if we didn't protect the illegals. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=350.4s)]
*  That guy had a rap sheet, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  instead he was at the Roosevelt Hotel [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  that you, the taxpayer, were paying for, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=356.28s)]
*  and then he requested to get on a plane [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=358.28s)]
*  and fly down to Athens with his brother, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=360.32s)]
*  which is where they lived, right next to that park [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=362.34s)]
*  where Lake and Riley was killed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=364.52s)]
*  So in both of these situations, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=366.32s)]
*  if they had been deported initially, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=368.14s)]
*  when they, not only did they break the law [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=371.52s)]
*  when they came across, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  but also committed more crimes, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=374.62s)]
*  they should have been deported, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=376.42s)]
*  and they weren't, and now two little girls' lives [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=377.58s)]
*  are gone, lost forever. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=379.7s)]
*  Jocelyn's parents were with President Trump in Arizona, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  speaking at a lot of events. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=384.9s)]
*  They wanna make sure this doesn't happen again, but it did. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=386.02s)]
*  We found out that a seven-year-old lost her life, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=389.26s)]
*  she wanted an illegal alien, driving drunk, killed her. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=391.1s)]
*  Tom Homan saw this story, knew it already. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=394.36s)]
*  We played it back to him. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=397.22s)]
*  Here's his reaction. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=398.54s)]
*  Throughout my career, I've seen a lot of tragedies. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=400.62s)]
*  We've talked about many tragedies. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=402.3s)]
*  Back with Tractor Trailer and 19 dead people at my feet, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  including a five-year-old boy who suffocated to death. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=407.02000000000004s)]
*  I thought the girls as young as nine years old [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=409.5s)]
*  that were raped multiple times by the criminal cartels, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=411.48s)]
*  and once you sit to a little, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=414.82000000000005s)]
*  we talked to a little nine-year-old girl [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=416.74s)]
*  that went through that sort of hell, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=418.70000000000005s)]
*  it changes who you are. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=420.82000000000005s)]
*  So yeah, I'm very passionate. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  It's just about illegal immigration. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  It's about the sexual assault of young girls [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=426.1s)]
*  and the murder of young girls in this country this year. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=430.04s)]
*  It breaks my heart. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  It's about fentanyl that's killed a quarter million [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  quarter million Americans. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  It's about a record number of people on terrorist watch lists. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=436.41999999999996s)]
*  It's about 600% increase in sex trafficking. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=439.14s)]
*  It's sick, and we can stop it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  President Trump had the most secure border in my lifetime. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=444.14s)]
*  We had the stuff locked down, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=446.58s)]
*  and this administration opened the border [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  and we have all these bad things happening now. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=448.94s)]
*  So now he's taking action, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=451.53999999999996s)]
*  and he's not just sitting around. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=452.64s)]
*  Now he's got the borders to our title. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=453.97999999999996s)]
*  You know he's been in Chicago. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=455.58s)]
*  You know he's been to New York. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=456.85999999999996s)]
*  Yesterday he met with Mayor Adams, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=458.29999999999995s)]
*  who was a captain of the police, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  and even though he wasn't as active, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=462.18s)]
*  and he's been a little wishy washy on this, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=464.09999999999997s)]
*  when Joe Biden gave him the Heisman, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  when he asked for some money to finance the 67,000, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=468.46s)]
*  the 112,000 who have trafficked through here illegally, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=471.34s)]
*  and the 67,000 were still housing, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=474.7s)]
*  they wanted no part of Mayor Adams. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=476.9s)]
*  Now he, under indictment, maybe perhaps, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=479.28s)]
*  he sat down with Tom Olman. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=481.78s)]
*  He goes, I want to hear what his plan is. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=482.97999999999996s)]
*  And the plan impressed the mayor, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=485.74s)]
*  and the mayor impressed Olman. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=488.46s)]
*  What's the problem? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=492.14s)]
*  Yesterday I saw a complete 180. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=493.97999999999996s)]
*  I saw the cop in him, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  and he has promised to work with us [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=497.41999999999996s)]
*  to target violent, criminal, illegal aliens in this city, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=501.46s)]
*  and to help us find over 300,000 missing children [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=504.86s)]
*  that this administration released on vetted sponsors. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=507.58s)]
*  I saw Eric Adams, a career cop, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=509.86s)]
*  and he really cares about public safety of the city, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=512.78s)]
*  and he wants to do what he can. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=514.9399999999999s)]
*  And he's willing to take the hits from the left to do it, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=516.14s)]
*  because it's the right thing to do. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=518.3s)]
*  He's putting public safety over politics. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=519.22s)]
*  And I even gave him credit, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=521.3s)]
*  because once he agreed to sit down, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=522.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna give him names yet, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=525.02s)]
*  but two other mayors have reached out [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=526.14s)]
*  until I verify they're gonna get to the table with me, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=527.62s)]
*  already reached out. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=530.06s)]
*  So I think this starts a domino effect. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=530.9s)]
*  If you knowingly conceal or harbor [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=532.9s)]
*  an illegal alien from ICE, that is a felony. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=534.9s)]
*  When I was an agent, a long time ago, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=537.66s)]
*  I've arrested US citizens for harboring an alien in their [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=539.5s)]
*  home or place of employment. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=542.02s)]
*  If I can do it to a citizen, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=543.78s)]
*  why can't I do it to a politician [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=545.14s)]
*  who's going to actively get in our way, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=546.9799999999999s)]
*  prevent us from doing our job? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=549.2199999999999s)]
*  The Democratic mayors is not too late to do the right thing. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=551.14s)]
*  I mean, you have the political cover of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=554.9s)]
*  there being a mandate, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=557.58s)]
*  the 60% of the country is for mass deportations. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=558.9s)]
*  If you look at all of your cities, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=563.26s)]
*  they pretty much went more red. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=565.54s)]
*  So there is a mandate when it comes to the country. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=567.94s)]
*  There's a vibe when it comes to the country. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=570.66s)]
*  Just do the right thing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=572.1s)]
*  We're only asking you to do the logical thing [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=573.46s)]
*  when there are criminals in your custody. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=576.02s)]
*  Just turn them over the ice. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=578.7s)]
*  No one even is asking for your assistance [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=580.1s)]
*  for the other deportation. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=583.26s)]
*  Tom Homan made it very clear. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=584.86s)]
*  I'm not asking local police to be a part of ICE. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=586.1s)]
*  I just want the criminals. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=588.9s)]
*  Get, turn them over. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=590.02s)]
*  You know, and this is, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=591.74s)]
*  and the message is so loud and clear [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=593.02s)]
*  from Tom Homan and Donald Trump. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=595.5s)]
*  And the reason it's loud and clear is because [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=597.7s)]
*  we haven't heard this for four years. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=599.22s)]
*  I mean, in the interview with us, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=601.5s)]
*  he's talking about going after criminal aliens, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=603.58s)]
*  people who are in this country. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=606.14s)]
*  A lot of them committed felonies [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=607.74s)]
*  and they're out and about and in sanctuary cities [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  and elsewhere. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=612.74s)]
*  And he's talking about finding the missing children. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=613.5799999999999s)]
*  300,000 missing children is the number. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=616.9s)]
*  It could be much higher than that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=619.5s)]
*  So, you know, bravo to the two of them sitting down. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=621.26s)]
*  Politically, they come from different worlds, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=624.0999999999999s)]
*  but they are united in one thing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=626.42s)]
*  and that is to make America safer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOgxNmMm84&t=628.5799999999999s)]
