# 'MUCH BIGGER' than people realize: Medical expert issues warning
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg)
*  This week, HHS secretary nominee RFK Jr. will meet with senators on Capitol Hill ahead of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=0.0s)]
*  his confirmation hearing next month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=5.68s)]
*  But the battle against big food is already taking shape as one Pennsylvania man sues [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=7.78s)]
*  nearly a dozen companies, accusing them of marketing ultra-processed foods to kids. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=11.96s)]
*  Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Sapphire joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=16.52s)]
*  And you know what, Dr. Nicole, we got some stats we just want to share. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=20.52s)]
*  It's actually shocking when you think about the health crisis in the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=24.04s)]
*  We talk a lot about adults, but let me tell you about some kids. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=28.0s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=30.68s)]
*  One in five Americans between the ages of 12 and 18 are pre-diabetic. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=32.64s)]
*  That's mind blowing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=38.04s)]
*  That's according to a 2019 study. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=39.44s)]
*  Five to 10 percent of children have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=41.6s)]
*  That according to a 2021 study. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=46.36s)]
*  What's your reaction to those stats? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=48.84s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, it's shocking, but not surprising. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  We've been watching this trend happen for the last decade or so. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=54.72s)]
*  And while we have come to accept the fact that American adults tend to be overweight, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=58.16s)]
*  have metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes and diabetes, it's now going into our children. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=63.08s)]
*  And that makes sense, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=67.72s)]
*  Because whatever lifestyles we as adults are doing, it goes down into our children as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=68.9s)]
*  So the lifestyle behaviors, unfortunately, is now harming our children. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=72.86s)]
*  You know, Nicole, sometimes the best questions that you can ask someone happen off camera [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=77.94s)]
*  after you finish the interview. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=82.64s)]
*  I just talked to May Musk and I said, what's your best beauty tip? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=84.0s)]
*  You know, here's this elegant woman who's aged so gracefully and she said, watch what you eat. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=87.84s)]
*  And we talked a little bit about what R.F.K. Junior is doing and so forth. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=92.84s)]
*  Here is a consumer, by the way, a lawsuit, Consumer Brands Association Food Safety and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=97.4s)]
*  Protecting the Integrity of the Food Supply is priority number one for food and beverage manufacturers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  Their attempt to classify foods is unhealthy simply because they are processed or demonizing food. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=108.16s)]
*  They're not going to be able to do that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=112.44s)]
*  They're going to be the one to do that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=113.64s)]
*  And so they're going to be the one to do that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=115.28s)]
*  And so they're going to be the one to do that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=116.88s)]
*  So that's the food industry trying to defend itself against the fact that R.F.K. Junior [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  and so many in the Make America Healthy Again movement, Cali Means, et cetera, are saying, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=125.12s)]
*  hey, these ultra processed foods are killing Americans, making them unhealthy and pushing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=131.88s)]
*  and propelling chronic disease in America. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=138.76s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you have to remember, this is a much bigger topic than just combating big [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=142.76s)]
*  food industry. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=147.0s)]
*  What we're talking about is harmful consumerism and marketing to the population of items that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=148.0s)]
*  may be harmful. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  We saw this with big tobacco in the 1960s and 70s. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=154.4s)]
*  But we still see alcohol being advertised, pharmaceuticals being advertised. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=157.68s)]
*  These all have addiction potentials, and they really feed on our natural dopamine pathways, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=161.36s)]
*  which is our reward centers in the brain. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=167.28s)]
*  So the big question is, you know, what are we doing here? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  If the product is harming the actual consumer, is the pitch, is it even working for the consumer [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=172.92s)]
*  or is this purely profit driven? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=178.88s)]
*  Because the harsh reality is people profit off of addiction. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=180.92s)]
*  And so one question, there's a lawsuit going on right now out of Philadelphia, out of Pennsylvania, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=184.94s)]
*  where someone who's a teenager has that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=189.88s)]
*  And they are now saying that the big food industry, because of their marketing and of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=194.0s)]
*  these addictive substances, led to this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  And while that may be true, I think marketing is very aggressive, especially to our younger [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  populations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=203.68s)]
*  We see it with social media. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=204.68s)]
*  We know there are consequences when it comes to these marketing campaigns. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=205.68s)]
*  But I also have the question, where are the parents in all of this? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=209.12s)]
*  We also as individuals have to be holding ourselves accountable for some of this as [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=212.4s)]
*  well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=216.2s)]
*  Yes, there are aggressive and harmful marketing campaigns. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=217.2s)]
*  There is disgusting chemicals in our food supply, especially that's what's accessible [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=220.12s)]
*  to lower income populations. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=225.0s)]
*  But also we have to think of as the individual, what are we choosing to do? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=227.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=231.1s)]
*  Well, I think the problem is, you guys, that our government is subsidizing ultra processed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=232.1s)]
*  food and it's going to poor people in particular. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=237.46s)]
*  I think that's really the crux of it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=240.86s)]
*  That seems like that would be an easy thing to effectuate. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=241.86s)]
*  We know they're going to go for transparency when it comes to a lot of the pharmaceuticals. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  How we implement change on food is going to be the hardest nut to crack. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=250.18s)]
*  But I think subsidies is a great place to start. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=253.06s)]
*  Dr. Sapphire, always great to see you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=254.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-mzSbwL3Wg&t=257.7s)]
