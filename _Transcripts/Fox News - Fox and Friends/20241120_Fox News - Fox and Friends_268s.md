# Big city mayor explains his shocking party switch
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs)
*  So, independence, the former Democrats finding a place in the Trump administration, in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=0.0s)]
*  GOP after being left behind by the Democratic Party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Our next guest is the mayor of my hometown of Dallas, Texas, and a former Democrat, and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  says his move to the GOP should have been a bigger wake-up call. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=13.76s)]
*  Mayor Eric Johnson joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=18.6s)]
*  So, Mr. Mayor, thanks for getting up this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=20.72s)]
*  You kind of warned people about this tie, but they didn't listen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=24.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=27.72s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what, Lawrence. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=28.88s)]
*  Good morning, first of all, to all of you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=30.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it turns out I was kind of a canary in the coal mine, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=32.28s)]
*  We talked about this a while back when I first switched parties just over a year ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=36.24s)]
*  We talked about the fact that I didn't think I was going to be some anomaly that everyone [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=42.36s)]
*  needed to worry about. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=45.68s)]
*  I thought that I was going to be a harbinger of things to come. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=47.04s)]
*  And it turns out that was exactly right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump has given the Republican Party a gift, and that gift is he has caused parts [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=53.6s)]
*  of the Democratic coalition that people thought would never, ever consider voting Republican [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=61.52s)]
*  to do exactly that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=67.16s)]
*  Donald Trump got more votes in the Hispanic community than any candidate, any Republican [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=69.48s)]
*  candidate for president in over 50 years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=75.84s)]
*  He got more black votes than any candidate from the Republican Party in over 48 years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=78.92s)]
*  So he has done something that people really didn't think could be done. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  And I think now is an opportunity for the Republican Party to double down on his message, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=89.72s)]
*  which is primarily that our cities, which is where 80% of our American population resides [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  and where a large percent of our ethnic minorities live, he cares about cities. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  He's a product of our cities, and I think we can make our cities great again by focusing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=106.6s)]
*  on law and order and the things that made me switch parties. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=112.88s)]
*  So when you look at some of the data, let's look at some of our Fox News voter analysis. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=113.88s)]
*  You got Harris got 50% of Latino men, you got Donald Trump 47%. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=118.32s)]
*  Back in 2020, Biden got 49, I'm sorry, 59% and Trump got 38%. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  Then when you look at black men, this is astonishing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=128.32s)]
*  Harris got 74%. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=130.88s)]
*  Trump got 24%. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=132.56s)]
*  Biden got 87%. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=133.88s)]
*  Trump got 12% back in 2020. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=136.48s)]
*  So I guess the question is, Mr. Mayor, how does he build on this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  How does the party, because Donald Trump is gone in four years, but how does the party [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=143.96s)]
*  keep the building on that success? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=148.16s)]
*  The answer is very simple. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=152.72s)]
*  An agenda for urban America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=154.32s)]
*  That is what these groups are hoping that's going to happen now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=156.72s)]
*  They believe that Donald Trump, our president-elect, can actually deliver on the promise of making [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=161.52s)]
*  our cities great again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=166.56s)]
*  And he can. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=167.56s)]
*  And I think he will. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=168.56s)]
*  But what we need is an agenda for urban America. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=169.56s)]
*  And that agenda needs to center around making our cities safe again, supporting our police [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  departments, funding them adequately. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=176.72s)]
*  It needs to focus on creating more opportunity, economic opportunity, by creating more jobs, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=178.44s)]
*  by lowering taxes and making sure our cities are permitting and doing things that they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=183.56s)]
*  need to be doing to encourage economic growth and for businesses to be able to succeed there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=190.6s)]
*  And all the things that people have been asking for for generations from our cities that have [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=196.08s)]
*  been under Democratic leadership that have failed to deliver on those things. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=201.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, in partnership with mayors like myself and Republican mayors around the country [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=205.04s)]
*  and frankly Democrat mayors that want to actually change their tune, can bring about those changes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=210.16s)]
*  But we really, really are excited in our cities. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=215.48s)]
*  And Donald Trump won more votes in our urban areas than any Republican has in God knows [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=218.88s)]
*  how long. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=224.64s)]
*  And that is because they really believed, they really believed in what he said on the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  campaign trail that we can actually do this and that the Republican Party shouldn't give [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=229.44s)]
*  up on our cities. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=233.84s)]
*  We need to actually invest in them and focus on them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=235.04s)]
*  And I think that's what he's going to do. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=237.12s)]
*  And I want to help him do that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=238.44s)]
*  I think our Republican mayors around the country are committed to doing it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=239.72s)]
*  And so I'm very optimistic that we will deliver on that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=243.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people in Dallas that wonder, and Texas frankly, saying what is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=247.04s)]
*  E.J. going to do next? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=250.88s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for joining the program this morning. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=252.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=256.68s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWrtXUAPBs&t=257.68s)]
