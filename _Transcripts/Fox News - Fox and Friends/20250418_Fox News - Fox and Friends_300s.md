# Italy's Meloni pledges to make the West 'great again' during Trump meeting
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA)
*  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Maloney, now the first European leader to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office yesterday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=0.0s)]
*  since he paused his tariffs for 90 days earlier this month. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=6.4s)]
*  Here's what she said about working with the Trump administration. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=10.0s)]
*  With Europe, the goal for me is to make the West great again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=14.1s)]
*  Okay? And I think we can do it together. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  We can. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about a geographical space. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=21.8s)]
*  I speak about a civilization. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=26.5s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=29.0s)]
*  So the member of the European Parliament joins us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=32.0s)]
*  He's a member of the Brothers of Italy party. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=34.3s)]
*  Carlo Fendanza joins us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=36.5s)]
*  Great to see you, Carlo. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=38.2s)]
*  Your reaction to the Prime Minister... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=39.6s)]
*  Good morning, everybody. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=41.5s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=42.5s)]
*  Your reaction to the Prime Minister and the President's meeting yesterday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=43.2s)]
*  How do you feel about our trade relationships? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Did they lay a good groundwork? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, it was a very impressive moment for us and for all the Europeans, I think, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=52.1s)]
*  because, you know, we were in a complete lack of trust and dialogue in this moment [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=58.0s)]
*  between the U.S. and the European Union. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=64.9s)]
*  And through this, the Meloni's initiative and availability of President Trump, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=68.1s)]
*  now we can start negotiating, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=72.7s)]
*  start talking about a new deal between the two shores of the Atlantic Ocean [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=74.9s)]
*  and the two pillars of the Western civilization, as Meloni said. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=80.6s)]
*  So this is very important for us, crucial time for us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=84.1s)]
*  We think that we can find a balanced agreement on this end. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=87.1s)]
*  I want to say not only on tariffs, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=91.0s)]
*  because we can speak about many projects, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  common investments that we can do together. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  And this is the new perspective we want to try to affirm now, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  together with President Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=102.8s)]
*  Yes, natural gas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=105.1s)]
*  We want to be your number one supplier of natural gas [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=106.5s)]
*  and move away from Russia even after this war is done. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  Here's what President Trump said about an EU deal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=112.5s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=114.8s)]
*  What if there is not a trade deal with the EU [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=116.4s)]
*  by the time of the end of your 90-day pause on the sale of gas? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  Oh, there'll be a trade deal, 100 percent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Oh, well, you think there won't be a trade deal? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=125.2s)]
*  Of course there'll be a trade deal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=127.0s)]
*  Very much. They want to make one very, very much. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=128.1s)]
*  And we're going to make a trade deal. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=130.9s)]
*  I fully expect it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=133.0s)]
*  But it'll be a fair deal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  Are they on your priority list? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=135.70000000000002s)]
*  Everybody's on my priority list. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=138.5s)]
*  But he did name a top 15, and you guys are probably the top one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=140.6s)]
*  So what is the plan? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=143.7s)]
*  Is there a plan for a visit? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=145.7s)]
*  I know the Vice President is going to be in Italy today. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  But is there a plan for a visit from the EU? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  There is a plan for a visit of President Trump in Rome in the next weeks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  And probably in that occasion, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=159.2s)]
*  a meeting also with the EU top leaders, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=161.0s)]
*  together with Maloney, naturally. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  And this was very welcomed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  And it's very appreciated by the European leadership, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=171.0s)]
*  because you have to, and you completely understand that you know perfectly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=173.9s)]
*  that there is not so much trust from President Trump to EU leadership. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=177.4s)]
*  But Maloney is the real interlocutor now, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=183.6s)]
*  the very appreciated European interlocutor for President Trump. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=186.3s)]
*  And we think that together, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=190.6s)]
*  we can try to make this distance between the two pillars of the West [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=192.1s)]
*  a bit closer than before. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=198.7s)]
*  And speaking together about tariffs, about new trade deal, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=201.2s)]
*  and all the opportunities of cooperation that we have also in the field of defense. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=207.4s)]
*  You know that we spoke a lot about this in the recent weeks, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=211.5s)]
*  and we want to deal with this also. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=215.9s)]
*  Carlo, real quick, you guys got out, Italy, not EU, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=218.7s)]
*  got out of the Belt and Road program. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=222.0s)]
*  You saw how you paid such a price during the pandemic with the Chinese presence there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=224.2s)]
*  And they're irresponsible the way they act in poisoning the world with the COVID-19 virus. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=228.3s)]
*  So you want this partnership with the West. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  Will that help get this done? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=236.8s)]
*  Yes, we think that it's a mistake when, for example, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=240.5s)]
*  the European Union seems to align its economy, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=243.5s)]
*  its industrial choice, industrial model towards China, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=247.4s)]
*  as we did, for example, with the electrification, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  the green deal, just on the electric technology and so on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=255.5s)]
*  We think that we have to realign our choices as Europe towards the West, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=260.4s)]
*  towards America, our traditional partners and allies. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=265.5s)]
*  This is our main goal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=268.8s)]
*  This is the issue that Melanie put every time on the European table. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=269.9s)]
*  And this is what she discussed also yesterday with President Trump with a great success. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=274.6s)]
*  Yeah, just in my view, let the Prime Minister of Italy lead. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=279.7s)]
*  Keep the German Prime Minister away and I think we'll get a deal. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=284.2s)]
*  Thanks so much. Appreciate it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4oV1G6GOiA&t=287.8s)]
