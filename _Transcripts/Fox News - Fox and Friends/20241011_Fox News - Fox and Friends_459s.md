# Eric Trump: 'It's shocking no one has talked about this'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw)
*  Moments ago, Governor Tim Walz was pressed by Good Morning America about why Kamala Harris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=0.0s)]
*  hasn't made good on her campaign promises while she's been in the White House. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=10.24s)]
*  Here is that exchange. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=14.56s)]
*  Something that former President Trump said, something that within your debate, they were [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=17.56s)]
*  saying that, hey, these are policies that Kamala Harris could have done three years ago when she [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=24.48s)]
*  was in the White House with President Biden. And she never did. What do you say to people who bring [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=30.16s)]
*  that up? Well, Donald Trump had four years to do it, if you're going to talk about that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=35.84s)]
*  And what the point is, you need a partner in Congress. You've seen these, we've seen different [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=39.68s)]
*  bills that are ready to pass. And Donald Trump makes sure he steps in. We saw it around immigration, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=43.36s)]
*  a bipartisan bill widely respected, wanting to make a difference in this, holding true to our [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=48.8s)]
*  values, securing the border. Donald Trump steps in and says, look, that's going to hurt my political [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=54.48s)]
*  future. Let's not make it happen. Oh, gosh. Well, they stop with that. Donald Trump's son, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=58.64s)]
*  Eric, who is EVP of the Trump Organization, joins us now to react. Good morning to Eric. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=64.48s)]
*  Hey, Ainsley, how are you? Hey, I'm doing well. What did you make of that? Because everyone has [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  been saying she had three and a half years to do this. Even your dad on the debate stage said that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=75.12s)]
*  to her. And now they're flipping it and saying, well, he had four years. Yeah. Well, Ainsley, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=79.12s)]
*  you can't answer a question if there's no answer to the question, right? Which is why he was trying [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  to slide his way through that. I mean, at the end of the day, they let 20 million illegal immigrants [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  into the country. And then you get to hear Kamala come out and talk about how she wants to fix [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=94.16s)]
*  the border, but she doesn't want to fix the border. And here's how you know why. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=98.0s)]
*  My father built about 600 miles of wall. He also built the rest of the steel slats that all they [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=101.6s)]
*  needed to do is literally put up end. And she sold all of them for scrap metal. Then she goes out [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=106.0s)]
*  and they fly 320,000 illegal immigrants into the country in the middle of the night. You guys covered [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=112.16s)]
*  it better than anybody. They were landing in airports all across the country. They're not [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=118.16s)]
*  serious about solving this problem. I mean, Ainsley, when was the last time you heard them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  talk about fentanyl? I mean, fentanyl has killed 300,000 children this year, 300,000. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=126.0s)]
*  You have police departments in this country that are running out of Narcan. That's how much fentanyl, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=132.16s)]
*  that's how big the problem has become. You don't hear them talking about it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=136.32s)]
*  Ainsley, they want illegal immigrants. She was the border czar. My wife was just down on the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=140.4s)]
*  border. The border patrol agents were literally telling her that they wouldn't allow them to turn [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=145.12s)]
*  on the security cameras that my father built, right? On big poles right behind the wall. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=148.8s)]
*  They wouldn't allow them to turn on the security cameras because they didn't want to show the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=153.2s)]
*  American people the magnitude of the problem that they have on the southern border. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=157.52s)]
*  And it's killing our country. It's killing our jobs. You see what's happening in Aurora, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=162.16s)]
*  Colorado, where you have Venezuelan gang members taking over people's low-income housing. I mean, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=165.92s)]
*  you see it with a drug pandemic in this country. You see it with the human trafficking. You see it [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=171.68s)]
*  with jobs. I mean, taking every job, I mean, you're seeing real systematic problems. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=176.72s)]
*  Right now in New York City, you have 157 hotels that are filled to the brim with illegal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=183.36s)]
*  immigrants. These are the most expensive hotels anywhere on earth. And yet, we have veterans [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  sleeping on streets. We're not doing anything to take care of them. They're not a serious [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=196.24s)]
*  administration. And the reason you have him do this rope-a-dope, Ainsley, is he can't answer [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=201.2s)]
*  the questions because their policies have been a disaster and they want these disastrous policies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=206.08s)]
*  You know, Eric, we're politics. You know this better than anyone. It's kind of what's going [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=210.96s)]
*  on in the times as to how we vote. And right now we have we saw what happened in Israel, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=215.36s)]
*  broke everyone's hearts. We saw what happened in Afghanistan. We can't pay our groceries. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=220.88s)]
*  We see all these illegal immigrants coming across our border. Crime is up. The list goes on and on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  So when I see Kamala Harris drinking a beer right when a hurricane is hitting the people we love [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=231.76s)]
*  in North Carolina and ripping down their houses and people are dying. Or when I see Tim Walz at [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  a stadium talking about football, it's just not the right time for that. We're all anxious. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=242.48s)]
*  We're all counting down until this election. Everyone's nervous. People are scared they're [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  going to lose our country. And they're having beers and talking about football and going [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=251.04s)]
*  pheasant hunting. It's just not the time. And this was the headline in Politico that Walz has to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=255.44s)]
*  launch media blitz to woo male voters. There's a deficit among young men voting for Kamala Harris [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=259.44s)]
*  and for Walz. So he's trying to focus on football and hunting, doing this interview with Michael [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=266.56s)]
*  Strahan in the middle of the University of Minnesota football stadium, taking social [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=271.52s)]
*  influencers hunting pheasant hunting and taking local reporters hunting or talking about hunting. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=275.6s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? Yeah, my reaction is, of course, Ainsley, she did a podcast called [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=281.12s)]
*  Call Her Daddy as a major hurricane was destroying our country. I mean, listen, I'm all for humor. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=288.64s)]
*  You know me very well as a person. I'm a funny guy, but wrong time, wrong place. No different [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=293.52s)]
*  than Biden sleeping on a beach on a Monday morning. Sunbathing on a beach on a Monday morning. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  Wrong time. And of course, Walz has to restore his reputation to the male voter. This is a guy who [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=303.44s)]
*  literally was putting tampons in males bathrooms in Minnesota. I don't think there's many [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=310.96s)]
*  masculine men that exactly find that to be a positive attribute. I mean, this is a guy who [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=318.32s)]
*  took his honeymoon to China. It's shocking that no one talks about that. I mean, I'm still trying [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=324.48s)]
*  to figure out with Tim Walz how a guy who was on a teacher salary was able to go over to China [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=328.8s)]
*  35 times. Listen, I've been in international business my entire life. I know a lot of those [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=334.64s)]
*  guys. Who's been over to China 35 times? Who pays for those trips? Who takes their money? Who takes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=338.48s)]
*  their honeymoon to communist China? And so, you know, I don't think you can restore your reputation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=344.72s)]
*  by, you know, kind of haphazardly going in a field and pretending, you know, pretending you're a great [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=350.16s)]
*  hunter. I mean, first of all, you're going to look insincere. Second of all, you're going to kind of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=354.24s)]
*  look foolish because if you don't do it all the time, you can, you know, see it from a mile away. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  But man, I mean, I think it's going to take a lot of work and I don't, I certainly don't think [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=362.56s)]
*  he can get there. Did you see what Obama said? He went to this campaign field office before he [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  went to this rally and he said, it's not the same kind of energy as we saw when I was running. He's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  worried about the black male vote. Because everything's gone downhill. Ainsley, there isn't [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  a single person who's watching us right now. Go try and get auto insurance. Look at mortgage rates. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=383.36s)]
*  You're getting 8% mortgage rates right now when under my father was two and a half percent, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look at the price of food. Look, gas is up three times. Utilities, the cost of an iPhone, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=392.24s)]
*  the cost of your cell bill, the cost of your, your cable, the cost of rent in this country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=398.08s)]
*  No one thinks this world is doing better. No one thinks America's doing better. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=403.84s)]
*  Our allies are being attacked. We're sending money overseas like drunken sailors, $200 billion to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine. And FEMA runs out of money. FEMA, the last hurricane, we put $334 million into that hurricane. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=414.64s)]
*  My orcas comes out and says he's out of money. And yet we sent $200 billion over to Ukraine. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=422.64s)]
*  People understand we're not putting America first. We're putting America dead last. And, and, and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=428.56s)]
*  it's just a sign of weakness. And my father will reverse that. My father will put this country [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  first and we're going to win on the economy and we're going to win on the military and we're going [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=438.88s)]
*  to win on absolutely everything. And he's, he's going to make America great again. Thank you, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=442.4s)]
*  Eric. Great talking to you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw&t=446.8s)]
