# A vote for Kamala Harris is a vote against your daughter’s future: Riley Gaines
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY)
*  You have one ticket that knows what a woman is and has vowed to take decisive action in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=0.0s)]
*  protecting our sex-based rights compared to the other ticket that thinks men can become [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=9.36s)]
*  pregnant and that tampons belong in boys' bathrooms. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=14.3s)]
*  I see on social media people saying they're voting for Kamala Harris because she's a woman. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=17.64s)]
*  Well guess what? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=22.64s)]
*  I am voting for Donald J. Trump because I am a woman. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=23.92s)]
*  Riley Gaines issuing a warning to voters who say they are supporting Kamala Harris just [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  because she's a female candidate, claiming the Democratic Party is anything but pro-woman. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=35.08s)]
*  Outkick.com contributor and host of the Gaines for Girls podcast, Riley Gaines joins us now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Riley, always so great to have you on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=48.08s)]
*  So you were at the rally and you're making the case. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=50.28s)]
*  The Democrats try to pretend like they own women. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=53.2s)]
*  They're the party for women. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=56.6s)]
*  And what's your case for why that's not the case? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=61.56s)]
*  Well, thank you guys. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=62.56s)]
*  Always a joy to be on with you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=64.08s)]
*  This is coming off the heels of the DNC. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=66.04s)]
*  We heard it from virtually every single speaker at the DNC. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=68.72s)]
*  They talked about they are the party of and for women. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=72.7s)]
*  They talked about a woman's right to dismember and abort the developing child in her womb. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=76.28s)]
*  They used the phrase my body, my choice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=81.84s)]
*  They spoke of health care freedom. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=85.28s)]
*  Where was this health care freedom in 2020? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=88.0s)]
*  This was not implemented. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=91.56s)]
*  This bodily autonomy they spoke of. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=92.76s)]
*  That didn't matter when it came to injecting yourself with an experimental, ineffective [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=94.36s)]
*  vaccine that has zero credibility. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=98.92s)]
*  No, the Democratic Party, they were the tyrants who fired health care workers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  They fired school teachers, active duty military members for not conforming with their autocratic [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=104.76s)]
*  mandates. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=110.68s)]
*  And so my message to voters, regardless of political affiliation, regardless of race, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=111.68s)]
*  of religion, of sexual orientation, of any identity factor, my message to voters is that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=119.56s)]
*  a vote for Kamala Harris is a vote against your daughter's future. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=126.72s)]
*  We see, of course, the issue that I speak most frequently of, the gender ideology movement. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=131.84s)]
*  We see how this movement preys on the most vulnerable, that being women and children. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=136.64s)]
*  It's stripping away our rights to safety, our rights to privacy, our rights to equal [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  opportunity. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=144.76s)]
*  But it's also important to mention that just this week we saw in Afghanistan, the Taliban [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=145.76s)]
*  implemented a law, the most oppressive law for women that we've seen thus far. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  Women aren't allowed to speak. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  They're not allowed to show any skin. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=156.76s)]
*  They're not allowed to leave their house without a male chaperone. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=158.56s)]
*  They're not allowed to even look at a man they are not related to or married to. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=161.0s)]
*  Yet have we seen a statement issued by the White House? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=169.0s)]
*  Women want a safe border. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=170.6s)]
*  Women want a good and stable economy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=171.64s)]
*  And none of those things have been, we have seen from the Democratic Party thus far, and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  we won't in the next four years if they maintain leadership. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  Riley, what does it say to you? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, the strongest demographic group in voting for Kamala Harris and voting for Democrats [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=181.6s)]
*  is single young women. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  That is their overwhelming strongest group. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=188.42s)]
*  We can go into why abortion is often a big issue with that group, even though Donald [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=192.27999999999997s)]
*  Trump has said he's not looking for a national abortion ban. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=199.16s)]
*  It pulls people in one direction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a female candidate, so a lot of people want to rally around a female [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=204.2s)]
*  candidate. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=207.6s)]
*  Do you think any of the things you're laying out to us, and you're young, I mean, is anything [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=208.72s)]
*  that you're laying out you think is breaking through with that group, that single young [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  women who are so reliable for Democrats? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=217.88s)]
*  I think so. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=221.4s)]
*  I think people my age, you know, just recently graduating college, we're getting out into [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=222.4s)]
*  the real world and we're seeing the effects of progressive policies. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=226.28s)]
*  Again, forget the gender ideology movement. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  Look at how much groceries cost, how much gas costs, how much rent, how much your mortgage, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  how much all that costs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=236.56s)]
*  So I think when you're getting out into the real world, people my age begin to understand, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=237.72000000000003s)]
*  again, the harm and the severity, the trajectory of where we're going if we vote for this same [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  leadership again. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=247.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, it takes time, it takes learning, it takes being exposed to tragic scenarios [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=248.92s)]
*  like what happened to me and like what happened to Lincoln Riley at the border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=254.32s)]
*  Again, all of this is because the Biden-Harris administration, and you can expect it to continue [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=258.12s)]
*  under the Harris-Waltz administration. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=263.44s)]
*  Real quick, Riley, are we doing enough? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=265.52s)]
*  Again, you're significantly younger than us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=267.24s)]
*  Are we doing enough to reach those young people where they're at with the technologies they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=270.2s)]
*  engage with news on? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=273.88s)]
*  Well, this is what the Democratic Party does so well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=276.32s)]
*  I have been super enthusiastic to see Donald Trump appearing on Theo Vonn's podcast. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=279.36s)]
*  He's joining Sean Ryan's podcast. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=284.24s)]
*  I think all of those things are wonderful. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=286.64s)]
*  It's a great way to reach my demographic. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=288.8s)]
*  He's now on TikTok. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=290.88s)]
*  Again, it's just a good way to get people with my age, my youth, our eyes on the issues [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=291.88s)]
*  at hand. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=298.06s)]
*  And we see Donald Trump as a real person. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=299.28s)]
*  That was what was awesome at the RNC as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=300.8s)]
*  I mean, there were many moments where Donald Trump was tearful. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  He was emotional. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=306.04s)]
*  He was moved to tears. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=307.04s)]
*  We saw his grandchildren around him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=308.68s)]
*  It's all an effective way to get people my age, pull on our heartstrings. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, I think a page we can take from the Democratic playbook. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=315.68s)]
*  Well, I think the Trump campaign is lucky to have you as a surrogate, Riley, and we [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=318.76s)]
*  love having you on. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=323.16s)]
*  Thanks, Riley. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=324.32s)]
*  Thanks, Riley. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=325.32s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-voBdCTbVqY&t=326.32s)]
