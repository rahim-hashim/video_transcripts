# 'Nervous laughter': Trump delivers warning to Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U)
*  At 12 minutes after the hour, another big story is the president-elect and the things [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=0.0s)]
*  that he's already talking about doing when he takes over. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=4.26s)]
*  One, if you guys don't seal up your border in the north and seal up your border in the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  south, Mexico and Canada, 25 percent tariffs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=10.28s)]
*  And China, if you don't clean up the fentanyl situation, 10 percent on anything coming into [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=14.0s)]
*  our country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=19.32s)]
*  So right away there was a call from Trudeau and then there was a visit. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And he went down and he goes, let's just work this out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=23.88s)]
*  At which time I think they were very blunt to each other. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=26.12s)]
*  And it looks as though in a standoff, he said, you've got to fix your border. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=28.76s)]
*  We got tens of thousands coming in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  It's a lot less of a problem than the north, than the south. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=33.56s)]
*  But there's a huge problem because you're not putting any assets there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=37.0s)]
*  The other issues is the drugs that come through go to the governor of New Hampshire. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  But then when they started talking, he said, you can't put 25 percent tariffs on us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  It will destroy my country, he said. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=49.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=51.52s)]
*  And Fox News has spoken to two people who were at that table with Trudeau and the president. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=52.52s)]
*  And the president was very direct about what he wants. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=58.84s)]
*  He said Canada is letting in drugs and people from 70 different countries. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=62.28s)]
*  And then here's a quote that you'll find at FoxNews.com. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=67.72s)]
*  The president-elect told the prime minister, if Canada cannot fix the border issues and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=71.56s)]
*  trade deficit, he will levy a 25 percent tariff on all Canadian goods on day one when he returns [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=75.48s)]
*  to office. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=81.22s)]
*  And Trudeau, there was a little laughter there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=82.22s)]
*  And Trudeau told him he can't levy the tariff because it would kill the Canadian economy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=84.24s)]
*  completely. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=88.88s)]
*  And Trump replied, asking, so your country can't survive unless it's ripping off the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=90.1s)]
*  U.S. to the tune of a hundred and billion dollars. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=95.6s)]
*  And then Trump suggested to Trudeau that Canada become the 51st state, which caused the prime [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=98.41999999999999s)]
*  minister and others to laugh nervously. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=104.02s)]
*  Also, reportedly, one person at the table said, well, Mr. President, that would be a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  very liberal state if Canada became a state. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=110.88s)]
*  And then Trump said something like, well, there could be a liberal state and a conservative [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=114.96s)]
*  state. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=121.6s)]
*  But nonetheless, he made it very clear. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=122.6s)]
*  This is what he wants to happen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=124.16s)]
*  And you know, as we reported yesterday, stuff is happening. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  They're adding more resources to our northern border. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=128.68s)]
*  So this totally happened. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=132.24s)]
*  I mean, just listening to this exchange, the president-elect totally told him this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=133.24s)]
*  If you cannot get your affairs in order, if you cannot guarantee, do your part, this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=140.16s)]
*  is part of your border as well, if you can't guarantee the safety of our people and your [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=146.16s)]
*  people, then we're going to put a tariff on you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  And I don't care if it tanks your economy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=153.68s)]
*  Do the right thing or this is what I'm going to do. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=155.32s)]
*  I love just the show of strength already that we're seeing across the globe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=157.88s)]
*  You have Donald Trump saying, tariff on you, tariff on you, Mexico. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=162.44s)]
*  The Mexico president immediately does something about it, puts something on social media, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=167.04s)]
*  not going to let him get to the border. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=171.48s)]
*  Then Justin Trudeau flies down to Mar-a-Lago unexpectedly. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=173.2s)]
*  They have dinner, they're laughing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  And then Donald Trump says, well, you want to fix it? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=179.28s)]
*  Fix your border or I'm slapping tariffs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=181.48s)]
*  What? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  That's going to ruin our economy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  That's going to kill Canada. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, then become the 51st state. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  I'll make you the governor. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=187.64s)]
*  Then you have the president now telling Israel or telling Hamas, release those hostages. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  If not, this is what's going to happen on January 20th. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=194.32s)]
*  I just wonder, number one, they got to put assets immediately on the border. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=196.92s)]
*  They're going to start fixing it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=201.76s)]
*  But how does that fit into the USMCA? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=203.16s)]
*  Because I thought the USMCA, are they violating it? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=205.32s)]
*  That's what I'm not clear on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=208.16s)]
*  Or does USMCA need to be revisited because that's supposed to affect NAFTA. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=209.56s)]
*  So I thought the Chinese were getting around it by saying, oh, Mexico gets a break. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  I have an idea. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=218.88s)]
*  We're going to buy a Mexican company and we're going to build our cars and our stuff in Mexico, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=219.88s)]
*  get that American discount. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=224.94s)]
*  So there needs to be some criteria put there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=226.74s)]
*  I think as we described it last week, I think this, the suggestion that there's going to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=229.54s)]
*  be these gigantic tariffs, which would screw up everybody's economy, are negotiating employed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=234.46s)]
*  And so ultimately there probably will be a new deal between the big three countries in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=239.82s)]
*  the Northern Western Hemisphere. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=244.86s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TraGJw290U&t=246.57999999999998s)]
