# 'TOTAL REJECTION': 'Fox & Friends' reacts to Trump's projected 2024 victory
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE)
*  Former President Donald Trump is projected to be the 47th president of the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=0.0s)]
*  of America. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=11.76s)]
*  It would be the first time since Grover Cleveland and the second time ever a president has won [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=13.16s)]
*  two non-consecutive terms. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=18.84s)]
*  It has been one of the greatest political comebacks of all modern history. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=21.92s)]
*  Donald Trump securing more than 270 electoral votes, we are projecting, flipping battlegrounds [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=25.84s)]
*  of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin Red and defending North Carolina. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=33.12s)]
*  So it's an incredible result after an unprecedented election cycle filled with twists and turns [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=38.24s)]
*  including two assassination attempts. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=43.8s)]
*  And that's not to mention two impeachments, the legal battles and days spent in courtrooms [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=46.96s)]
*  instead of on the campaign trail. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=51.44s)]
*  And despite efforts from the mainstream media and Democrat elites to write him off, Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=54.12s)]
*  is projected to be the 47th president of the United States. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=58.68s)]
*  He addressed his supporters earlier this morning. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=62.36s)]
*  I will be fighting for you and with every breath in my body. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=66.84s)]
*  I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=72.68s)]
*  children deserve and that you deserve. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=77.48s)]
*  This will truly be the golden age of America. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=81.28s)]
*  I want to also thank my beautiful wife, Melania First Lady. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=85.08s)]
*  Who has the number one bestselling book in the country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=100.72s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=103.64s)]
*  Now she's done a great job, works very hard. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=111.28s)]
*  Works very hard to help people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=118.68s)]
*  Now I can say Vice President-elect of the United States, J.D. Biden. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=120.36s)]
*  He's turned out to be a good choice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=126.36s)]
*  I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was, I knew the brain was a good one. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=130.76s)]
*  Hello Mr. President, I appreciate you allowing me to join you on this incredible journey. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=137.64s)]
*  I thank you for the trust that you placed in me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=142.92s)]
*  And I think that we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=146.48s)]
*  States of America. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=151.04s)]
*  This will forever be remembered as the day the American people regained control of their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=154.0s)]
*  country. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Wow, it's hard to put all this in perspective, but there's other major [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  stories this morning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=167.48s)]
*  Republicans are said to regain control of the Senate perhaps in a big way, ending a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=169.32s)]
*  four-year stretch in the minority after flipping an Ohio seat red. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=172.56s)]
*  We have live team coverage on the historic morning. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=177.64s)]
*  Madeleine Rivera will give us an update on all the Senate races and a huge win for Republicans [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=179.88s)]
*  and many on the precipice of doing just that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=185.04s)]
*  Kevin Cork has the key issues on the ballot in different states, but first, Lucas Tomlinson [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=187.44s)]
*  is live at the White House with Trump's path to victory. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Lucas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=195.16s)]
*  Well, good morning, Brian. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=196.32s)]
*  As Stephen J.D. Vance said adroitly, this has to be considered the greatest political [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=197.32s)]
*  comeback in history. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=201.76s)]
*  We knew who would win. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  The battleground states would win this election. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=204.54s)]
*  And, of course, it all started with Pennsylvania. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=206.4s)]
*  Whoever won Pennsylvania no doubt was going to win the race. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=209.32s)]
*  The race was called in Pennsylvania at 1.19 a.m. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=212.32s)]
*  No question Trump's campaigning in the western part of the state recently helped move this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  race over the finish line. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=219.92s)]
*  The state is the second largest producer of natural gas and where fracking produces a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=221.44s)]
*  majority of this country's energy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  Working class Americans helped move Trump over the finish line. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  Now, let's move down to Georgia. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=230.32s)]
*  The state was called for Trump at 1248 a.m. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=232.16s)]
*  A state Trump narrowly lost in 2020 and vitaled his reelection win. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  It was in Wisconsin, let's go over there next, that put Trump over the edge over the finish [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=240.12s)]
*  line, winning by three points and sealing the victory. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=244.0s)]
*  Trump talking, taking the blue walls of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=247.56s)]
*  And of course, down in North Carolina, that was the first of the swing states that Trump [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=251.6s)]
*  won, setting a tone for the evening. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  The state was called for Trump at 1143 p.m. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=257.28s)]
*  Now, Arizona moving out west has not been called yet. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=260.96s)]
*  We had been warned it would take days to count all the votes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=263.88s)]
*  And in Nevada, another state that has not been called for Trump yet, but as you can [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  see, he's up by roughly four points. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=271.08s)]
*  Same goes for Michigan. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=273.48s)]
*  No question Israel's war in Gaza and Lebanon played a role here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=274.8s)]
*  Trump is up by a few points there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=278.4s)]
*  Now, let's show you the map, Brian, showing President Trump's path to the 270 finish line. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=280.28s)]
*  He's at 270 right now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=285.84s)]
*  We did not see the red wave during the midterms, but we see it now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=286.84s)]
*  And once again, there's no question that working class Americans and minorities helped Donald [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump become the second president to win nonconsecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in 1892, guys. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=302.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=303.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=304.32s)]
*  You know, and as Lucas is standing there at the White House, you've got to figure Joe [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=305.32s)]
*  Biden upstairs watching on the big screen. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=308.52s)]
*  Joe Biden this morning is saying, I told everybody I'm the only one who could beat [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=311.76s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  But of course, we saw that that that Joe Biden who went to that debate could not beat Donald [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=321.96s)]
*  I couldn't care less about Joe Biden. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=322.96s)]
*  I really could. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, he paved the way for this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  He paved the way by being a terrible president. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  And this is what the American people said. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=328.64s)]
*  It's not my opinion. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=330.0s)]
*  It's not our opinion. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=331.0s)]
*  This is a total rejection in every way. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=332.56s)]
*  And the areas in the demographics that Donald Trump didn't win, he gained massively. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=335.02s)]
*  If you even look at Chicago, Joe Biden, 80 plus percent of the vote, it's now 60 percent [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=339.96s)]
*  for Harris. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  She did not outperform. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  She did not outperform Biden in a single state. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=348.44s)]
*  And for those people who said this is way too close to call and Donald Trump is blowing [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=351.2s)]
*  in at the last minute. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=354.88s)]
*  And what about that MSG rally? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=356.14s)]
*  And what about that comedian? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  You still don't understand the country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=359.12s)]
*  Yeah, because when you look at the voter analysis, it tells a much different story than all the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=361.28s)]
*  pundits that went on TV. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=365.24s)]
*  Fifty six percent of Hispanic support for Harris, 41 percent for Donald Trump. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=367.2s)]
*  I mean, that is historic when you're looking at the numbers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=372.4s)]
*  Right, because Democrats live off the minority vote, but do nothing for them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=375.28s)]
*  And they're tired of it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=380.36s)]
*  And look at the support that Trump had among the Latino and Hispanic voters. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=381.36s)]
*  This went up four years ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=386.64s)]
*  He was getting 35 percent. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=388.88s)]
*  And this year he got 41 percent. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=390.56s)]
*  And then when it comes to Lawrence, you told us this was happening. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  Biden ignored this trend. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=397.0s)]
*  We were screaming at the top of our lungs that there is a new day. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=398.32s)]
*  And he almost doubled his support amongst all black voters, not just black males. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=401.72s)]
*  Twenty twenty was at eight percent at twenty twenty four, fifteen percent. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=406.4s)]
*  Almost doubling it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=411.04s)]
*  You know, and historically the Democrats lead with the younger voters. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=412.04s)]
*  And in fact, last night, a lot of people on the political left were talking about how [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=416.04s)]
*  look at the long lines at the colleges. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=419.92s)]
*  Well, OK, there were long lines. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=421.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris did wind up with a majority of people under 30. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=424.96s)]
*  Donald Trump came right behind her, just about six points behind. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  But here is the here's the one. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=433.64s)]
*  And this is this goes to a whole suite of numbers that we've got about what really [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=435.88s)]
*  had people go and push the button for Donald Trump. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=441.48s)]
*  And that is this in our Fox voter analysis, we talked to one hundred and ten thousand [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=444.08s)]
*  people across the country. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=449.2s)]
*  And those falling behind financially went for Trump by 63 percent, only about a third [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=450.44s)]
*  of the country for Donald Trump. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  And ultimately, the other number that is the reason he will be the next president in the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=456.96s)]
*  United States, 70 percent of Americans said America is on the wrong track and they want [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=461.67999999999995s)]
*  something. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=467.84s)]
*  So is this the end of legacy media? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=468.84s)]
*  Is this the end of you watching other networks and they tell you how to vote? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=470.76s)]
*  They saw right through this. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  They saw right through them peddling all the lies. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=477.44s)]
*  The conspiracy theories. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=480.0s)]
*  This is a man who has survived so much. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=481.28s)]
*  All of the court cases, all of the investigations, two impeachments, two special prosecutors, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=483.79999999999995s)]
*  opposition from a chunk of his own party, including his former vice president. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=490.44s)]
*  And last night, he said at the speech or this morning, I should say, he said, everyone told [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=494.4s)]
*  me that God had a purpose for my life, that he spared me when during these assassination [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=499.2s)]
*  attempts. A couple of things come to mind. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  I walked in today and I know we declared I was up at two oh five. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=507.56s)]
*  We declared a two twenty five to thirty five around there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=511.12s)]
*  I watched the president's speech in the car ride in and I thought I was just shocked to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=513.48s)]
*  see nobody else is declaring that Trump won. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=518.56s)]
*  What more do you need to see? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  The popular vote, almost every battleground state, almost impossible to catch up. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=522.96s)]
*  In fact, as I'm walking in today, CNN has an announcement. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=526.96s)]
*  New Jersey will go to Harris. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=530.56s)]
*  Really? That's your announcement. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=532.68s)]
*  And newsweek. Go ahead. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=534.52s)]
*  And they and they know, Brian, to your point, that he's going to win this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=535.92s)]
*  And the popular vote. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=539.56s)]
*  The panic has already started to the blaming voters. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=540.64s)]
*  They're saying it didn't work as it relates to the talking about his indictments and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  talking about everything else but what the American people said, which is the economy [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=547.88s)]
*  was the number one issue. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=551.76s)]
*  The American people and immigration as well. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=553.0s)]
*  And there was no response on the campaign trail to any of those issues from the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=555.92s)]
*  Democrats. A lot of them are waiting for the Associated Press to go ahead and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=560.4s)]
*  project history. But can I just add one thing? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=564.76s)]
*  Let me just finish this one thing about it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=566.84s)]
*  When you look at because it goes with what I was just talking about, when you look at [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=568.72s)]
*  the big newspapers right now, to your point, Ainsley, the New York Times, the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal all are just simply talking about [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=576.52s)]
*  the comeback and he's on the verge. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=580.44s)]
*  So it's on the verge until they officially declare. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=583.24s)]
*  So a couple of things. If you want to know how sober the country is and how detached [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=586.08s)]
*  American politicians are in California, the crackdown on crime bill. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=591.6s)]
*  Prop 34, which he says, I'm not even going to tell you what the vote is. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=596.88s)]
*  These people who are victims of smashing grabs from old business owners, those [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=601.24s)]
*  people, they don't feel comfortable going out of their house, go into a theater, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=604.04s)]
*  wherever, stealing their car, whatever it is. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=606.84s)]
*  They have they came called in California to crack down on crime. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=609.32s)]
*  I think that says so much about the country. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=613.48s)]
*  That Kamala Harris wouldn't admit how she voted. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=615.96s)]
*  And it's no big deal, according to Senator Murphy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  It's no big deal. It's no big deal. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=620.36s)]
*  She doesn't want to tell everyone that she's tough on crime. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=622.16s)]
*  Well, the voters have demanded that the candidate tell them what they will do, as [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=625.16s)]
*  opposed to I am going to be joyful. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=631.44s)]
*  I'm going to be happy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=634.44s)]
*  And that should be enough. I'm younger and I'll be different, but I won't do [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=636.12s)]
*  anything different. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, there were a bunch of propositions and amendments on the ballot, including [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=640.52s)]
*  a lot of the pot and abortion down in Florida. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=644.88s)]
*  We're going to talk all about the various other ballot initiatives in a little bit. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=647.76s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpeg68gqCE&t=652.16s)]
