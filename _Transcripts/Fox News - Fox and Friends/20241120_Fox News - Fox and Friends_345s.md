# Dr. Jordan Peterson: Elon Musk knew what he was doing all along
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4)
*  As meanwhile, incoming FCC chair, Brendan Carr, is ready to dismantle the censorship [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=0.0s)]
*  cartel in his words and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=4.92s)]
*  Dr. Jordan Peterson exhales because he knows about censorship firsthand, having dealt with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=9.08s)]
*  it himself in two countries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=13.84s)]
*  He's also the author of a brand new book, quote, We Who Wrestle with God. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=15.82s)]
*  Dr. Peterson and his brilliant daughter, Michaela, talk about that and more. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=20.0s)]
*  Dr. Peterson, when people talk about censorship, I think about you right away and stuff that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=26.4s)]
*  you've been suffering from and what Elon Musk was able to do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Unmask the censorship that's been taking place for years, whether it's the laptop or whether [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  it's the pandemic. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=40.32s)]
*  Your thoughts about what a good FCC chairman would do. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=41.959999999999994s)]
*  Well, I think at minimum he should ensure that we know how the algorithms operate on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=46.44s)]
*  social media networks and how things are promoted and how things are hidden. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=53.48s)]
*  Because the real danger, one of the real dangers that confronts us is that our discourse is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=58.8s)]
*  going to be mediated by intelligence systems whose mechanisms are completely hidden from [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=63.72s)]
*  us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=68.6s)]
*  And that actually interferes with our perception, not just our conceptions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=69.6s)]
*  Because what we see is pre-screened in ways that are invisible to us and increasingly [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=74.62s)]
*  automated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=79.52s)]
*  And that's not a good harbinger for the future, let's say. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=80.52s)]
*  So transparency with regards to how things are promoted and demoted, that would be real [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=85.24s)]
*  helpful. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=91.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=92.16s)]
*  Here's Brendan Carr in his own words. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=93.16s)]
*  There's a couple of top issues. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=94.8s)]
*  Number one is looking at tech censorship. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Free speech is the bedrock of our democracy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=99.44s)]
*  And there's been this unprecedented surge in censorship over the last couple of years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=102.24s)]
*  We need to restore Americans' First Amendment rights. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=106.96s)]
*  Number two is to look at our approach to media. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  I think the status quo, particularly when it comes to legacy media, needs to change. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=113.08s)]
*  Mikhail, I'm sure you could see eye to eye with that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=118.28s)]
*  When I just saw a new study by Pew Research that said 30% of young people get their news [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=120.96s)]
*  from influencers online. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=129.04s)]
*  I mean, that, we also have a bit of a problem with how many people get their news from TikTok. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=130.04s)]
*  Because we don't even know how the TikTok algorithm works and whether news is getting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=135.76s)]
*  pushed onto that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=139.84s)]
*  So I mean, transparency there would be good. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=141.68s)]
*  But hopefully this guy can bring about some change. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=145.2s)]
*  Dr. Peterson, it's not, it was not unpredictable. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  But when he invited journalists in like Matthew Schellenberger and Matt Taibbi, when he bought [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=150.92s)]
*  Twitter to expose the Twitter files and he talked about, saw the manipulation from the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=155.84s)]
*  FBI to the, to people like Adam Schiff, that got him on the bad list with everybody. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=161.84s)]
*  He teamed with Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=168.84s)]
*  He's off that bad list, wouldn't you say? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=170.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=172.44s)]
*  Well, it turns out that Elon Musk knew what he was doing when he bought Twitter. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=173.44s)]
*  He's generally a bad man to bet against, I would say. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=177.4s)]
*  You know, you see pundits constantly describing how Elon Musk is making mistakes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=180.44s)]
*  And I think, well, you know, God willing, you'd make the kind of mistakes that Elon [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=184.56s)]
*  Musk makes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm so interested to watch X emerge to dominate too. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, that's the case around the world increasingly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  We'll see what happens as a consequence of his alliance with Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you feel like you're unleashed, Dr. Peterson? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you feel like you've gotten through the worst times when the Canadian government was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  cracking down on you? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=205.7s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  My license in Canada is still threatened. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=208.42s)]
*  I'm still in the middle of an intense battle with Ontario College of Psychologists and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  behaviour analysts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=215.46s)]
*  And to call them unreasonable is to barely even scratch the surface. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=216.46s)]
*  I guess I'm pleased about that battle in some regards because all of the things that they're [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=220.74s)]
*  accusing me of are things that have turned out to be, I was on the side of the angels, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=224.96s)]
*  let's say. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=230.82s)]
*  So, for example, they're after me because of my opposition to the promotion of this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=231.82s)]
*  mutilating trans surgery for children. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that I was an early adopter of that objection is looking pretty damn good. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=239.5s)]
*  But no, it's by no means over, not in the least. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=245.28s)]
*  They want to re-educate me. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  They're organising that right now, although the details have still remained frustratingly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=250.32s)]
*  unclear. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=256.24s)]
*  Trudeau in Canada is doubling down on the free speech front in a terrible way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=257.24s)]
*  You guys got to get rid of him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=261.24s)]
*  Real quick, Mikael, what's it like watching your dad go through this, knowing he's probably [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=262.8s)]
*  the smartest person you've ever met? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=266.44s)]
*  And I could say that from an outsider, and you could say it from a biased perception [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=268.6s)]
*  and be 100 percent correct. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=272.72s)]
*  Is that tough for you to see? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=274.52s)]
*  I can't even describe how stressful it was, especially, you know, our views of mainstream [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  media changed during that period when we saw that they were publishing lies about my dad. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  But every time something negative came out, it changed people's perception of my family [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=286.24s)]
*  around us, which was awful. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  So it was incredibly stressful. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  I would say, you know, dad's still in the midst of it with the college in Canada, and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=296.28s)]
*  Canada is not heading in a positive direction like America is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  But at least people are more wary, I think, of what they read online. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=306.0s)]
*  So our lives, I would say, have gotten much less stressful than they were a couple of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  years ago. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=315.52s)]
*  I think we could kind of feel the tide turning about a year ago that being pro freedom of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=316.52s)]
*  speech and talking about trans issues, that started to get less offensive. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  So I'm more positively, probably inclined than my dad. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b80JqpUG6Z4&t=329.96s)]
