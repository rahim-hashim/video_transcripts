# ICE raids target Venezuelan gang in Colorado
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4)
*  This is the White House revealing nearly 200 illegal immigrants, gang members have been arrested since Trump returned to office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=0.0s)]
*  And it comes after federal officials round up over 100 violent Venezuelan gang members in Colorado who have terrorized apartment buildings in the city. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=6.8s)]
*  In his first interview since being appointed U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=17.72s)]
*  Chief, welcome to the program. Congratulations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=23.46s)]
*  As people may or may not know, you used to be the Texas border czar. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=25.78s)]
*  You were a border patrol agent before that and you come on back home to get our border secure. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=30.42s)]
*  Talk about these latest numbers that you have and how you guys have been able to get it done, Chief. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=36.46s)]
*  So look, U.S. Border Patrol, we know how to get the job done. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=42.1s)]
*  We know how to secure the border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=44.34s)]
*  All we needed was a president that was going to empower us, a strong leader like President Trump, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=45.66s)]
*  and then a secretary like Secretary Noem that knows exactly what we need to do to secure the border. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=50.06s)]
*  We're seeing almost a 90 percent decrease in illegal entries since January the 21st. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=54.74s)]
*  Not only that, but our criminal prosecutions of those we're apprehending is up almost 52 percent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=60.14s)]
*  You talked about, you know, you let in with the trend of our U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=66.26s)]
*  Border Patrol, BORTC unit is out there with us making those arrests. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  And so we're shown how to secure the border. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  All we needed was an administration that would let us enforce the law. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=76.42s)]
*  And we're out there and we are seeing phenomenal gains on the border. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=79.46s)]
*  So, Chief, let's talk about that because I was made aware through some of my sources within the community [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=83.06s)]
*  that are out there on those rays yesterday that there were some leaks from local media that tipped off [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=89.58s)]
*  the local activists on the ground and it made your jobs difficult. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=95.58s)]
*  But this is also an officer's safety issue. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=99.78s)]
*  You've got all these tactical units going in for a reason in a stack because you've got criminal aliens [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=103.7s)]
*  that are on the street that have weapons, that have grenades, that have all type of things. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=109.42s)]
*  Talk about the leaks that have been going out from the media. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=114.1s)]
*  And so, you know what, it's just irresponsible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=117.22s)]
*  The fact is we're going after known criminals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  We are targeting criminals and leaking and letting them know we're coming is creating more of a danger [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=121.94s)]
*  for not just our officers and agents, but for the very communities that we're trying to enforce [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=126.74s)]
*  and make safe and secure. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=131.14s)]
*  You know what, it's just irresponsible to be communicating ahead of time what we're going to be doing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=132.7s)]
*  in a law enforcement operation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=136.78s)]
*  You know, we've got to hold the press accountable to not put the public in danger. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=138.38s)]
*  They're putting my officers in danger. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=143.82s)]
*  They're putting agents in danger. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=145.54s)]
*  And, you know, it's just unacceptable. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=147.14s)]
*  You know, part of the reason why you have been letting the media know is to be transparent [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=149.38s)]
*  because there's been a lot of misinformation put out there to the public saying that you're going out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=154.14s)]
*  to the US citizens, that you're targeting Abuela and families and all that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  When right now, based on what the president has said, the Department of Justice has said, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  and Homeland Security, you guys are going after criminal aliens, people that are rapists, murderers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=166.66s)]
*  I've been told by some of my sources that you guys are considering a media blackout [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=173.7s)]
*  because it's putting your officers' safety at risk right now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=178.18s)]
*  And if that's what it takes to ensure the safety of my Border Patrol agents and the community, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=182.54s)]
*  that's what we'll do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=186.5s)]
*  And I can tell you that it's just nonsense. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=187.94000000000003s)]
*  It's rhetoric that we're targeting. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  You know, there was a news report that we're going to target school buses and children on school buses. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=196.9s)]
*  And if you want to talk about Abuelas, my Abuela is a naturalized citizen from Mexico. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=197.9s)]
*  We're surely not targeting Abuelas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  We're not targeting US citizens. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=203.5s)]
*  We're not targeting people that are in this country illegally, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=204.74s)]
*  We don't have the authority to go after someone that's in this country illegally. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=207.22000000000003s)]
*  We're targeting criminals and those that have broken the law by entering the country illegally. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=209.66000000000003s)]
*  So, Chief, one of the things that you have at your disposal now is an AG in Pambandi [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=213.78s)]
*  who is going to follow the law. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=218.58s)]
*  And she laid out her day one directive, which included eliminating cartels in a new memo. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=219.9s)]
*  She revealed that the Mexican cartel targeting, they're targeting Border Patrol agents with [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=226.22s)]
*  drones, explosives. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  I was just down there at the border with you and the Secretary of Defense. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=233.06s)]
*  Tell me what you're going to do to keep your officers safe as a result of the cartel being [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  frustrated with Charles' work so far. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=241.98s)]
*  So as we expect, when we push hard, the criminals are going to push back. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=244.78s)]
*  And we're prepared for that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=248.1s)]
*  We're trained. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=249.1s)]
*  We've got the equipment and the technology to support us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=250.1s)]
*  Our officer safety and our agent safety is number one. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=252.9s)]
*  And so we're not going to tolerate that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=255.78s)]
*  But going back to what the new AG said in Pambandi is, you know what? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=258.34s)]
*  We need the support of the DOJ to actually prosecute these individuals. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=262.18s)]
*  If there's an assault on an agent, there should be no question that that agent is going to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=266.42s)]
*  be processed or that criminal is going to be processed to the full extent of the law. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=269.66s)]
*  Consequence has actions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=274.98s)]
*  And the reason why we've seen an almost 90 percent drop is because people now understand [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=275.98s)]
*  that they're not going to be caught and released. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  They're going to be caught, they're going to be prosecuted, and they're going to be [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  processed and removed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=283.86s)]
*  It goes for the same thing for anyone who's willing to put their hands on one of my agents. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. Attorney's Office has got to prosecute these individuals to ensure they send a clear [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=289.1s)]
*  message. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  You will not lay a hand on an agent. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  Are you going to fill the full brunt of the U.S. government? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=296.3s)]
*  You guys got an excellent team. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=300.14s)]
*  You're working together. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=302.26s)]
*  You have known each other for years. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=303.26s)]
*  And part of the reason why the cartel is upset is because their tunnels are now filled with [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=304.94s)]
*  concrete. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  A lot of their contraband has been taken away. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  And their entire criminal enterprise of getting people across the border has been disrupted [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=312.26s)]
*  and the drugs have as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=316.6s)]
*  Chief, stay safe. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=318.18s)]
*  Please give my regards to your men and women out there. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=319.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=321.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=322.58s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=323.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjzTcilSLo4&t=329.38s)]
