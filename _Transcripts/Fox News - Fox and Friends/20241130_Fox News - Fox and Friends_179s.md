# Attorney reveals the predicted fate of Trump’s Georgia election case
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo)
*  Donald Trump's legal battles are all but over following his historic election win, but there's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=0.0s)]
*  one holdout still prosecuting the president-elect and battled Fulton County DA Fannie Willis. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But sources tell the New York Post the state Supreme Court is getting ready to dismiss [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=14.72s)]
*  the case, throwing Willis' professional future into doubt. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=19.44s)]
*  Former federal prosecutor Francie Hakes joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=23.6s)]
*  Good morning, Francie. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=26.92s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=27.92s)]
*  What I understand, obviously this is the last case with the state of Georgia here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=29.4s)]
*  What makes this, what makes people believe this case will be dropped? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=35.64s)]
*  Well good morning, Joey. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=41.28s)]
*  Right now the case sits with the Georgia Court of Appeals and just this week they're supposed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=42.28s)]
*  to have oral arguments on the defense's motion to have Fannie Willis recused from the case [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=48.36s)]
*  for a variety of misconduct. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=56.16s)]
*  And without any warning, without any apparent motion, and without any explanation, the Court [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  of Appeals just removed, that is, canceled that oral argument. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  And so there's speculation that they are getting ready to just rule based on the briefs instead [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=69.92s)]
*  of requiring oral argument. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=75.72s)]
*  And if they're not requiring oral argument, they've probably made up their mind and I'm [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=77.52s)]
*  guessing that the election has something to do with it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=81.4s)]
*  Yeah, we all saw the riveting, we've televised it live here on Fox, the riveting case where [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  Fannie Willis' relationship with Nathan Wade was highlighted and showing where she might [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=89.32s)]
*  have, for lack of a better term, been exposed to malpractice in bringing these charges. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=92.96s)]
*  So are we looking at a situation where she as the prosecutor is removed and thus the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=98.72s)]
*  case goes away and another prosecutor picks it up? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  Or is it the merits of the case itself could have it thrown out? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, Joey, if she gets recused and the case simply gets removed from her office, because [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=110.76s)]
*  if she's conflicted out, her entire office is conflicted out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=116.56s)]
*  And then the case goes over to what's called the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  And they have the ability to either assign the case to one of their lawyers, a sort of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=124.76s)]
*  roving prosecutors. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=130.12s)]
*  In fact, we saw one of the prosecutors in action in the Lake and Riley case last week. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=131.12s)]
*  She worked for the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia so they could assign it to one [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=136.48s)]
*  of them or they could assign it out to a different elected DA. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  And the case would effectively start from zero because no prosecutor is going to want [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=144.28s)]
*  to come in and simply start where Fannie Willis left off. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  They're all going to go to the beginning. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=151.88s)]
*  And I suspect they'll all reach the same conclusion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=153.72s)]
*  There was no violation of law here and this case should never have been brought. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=156.33999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that seems to be what most people think. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=160.12s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  The law fair has to end and our president needs to be able to govern. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=163.68s)]
*  Francie Hakes, thanks for joining us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17JtfhhMyo&t=167.48000000000002s)]
