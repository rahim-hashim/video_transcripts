# Lone Biden official breaks silence on cognitive decline
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc)
*  All right, let's get to the news this morning. Fox digital reached out to everyone affiliated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=0.0s)]
*  with Joe Biden's cabinet. There were 26 people that they reached out to to find out about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Joe's mental fitness and acuity. What did they know? Who knew what? Did y'all cover [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=9.76s)]
*  it up? Only one person responded to that. And we'll get to that in just a minute. But [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=15.68s)]
*  that was health and human services secretary Xavier Becerra. But here's a flashback of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=20.2s)]
*  Biden cabinet officials defending his mental fitness. We have a very bold and vibrant president [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=25.0s)]
*  in Joe Biden. The most difficult part about a meeting with President Biden is preparing for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  it because he is sharp, intensely probing and detail oriented and focused. The president has [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=40.28s)]
*  no impairment. The president you've never seen any. I don't know how many ways I can say this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=48.2s)]
*  I wish you could be in a room with him the way I often am seeing how he is simultaneously [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=53.24s)]
*  focused on a big picture vision and very focused on details. Is he fit? He's proven it. He is and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=59.0s)]
*  he could do the job. I think his experience has helped him be a great president. What else are [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=66.92s)]
*  they lying about? When I see people staring to the camera, straight to our face and to those [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=72.92s)]
*  reporters' faces asking him directly, you have to just ask what else are you lying about? And [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=78.6s)]
*  they will never have credibility with the American people. I think with the Democratic party, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=83.64s)]
*  it's going to be the people that knew and lied and then the people that had nothing to do with it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=87.24s)]
*  The people that had nothing to do with it will be the ones that have a future in the party. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  So Xavier Becerra, the former HHS secretary, said this. He responded to Fox News Digital. He said, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=95.72s)]
*  I met with President Biden when needed to make important decisions and to execute with my team [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  at HHS. It's clear the president was getting older, but he made the mission clear. Run the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=107.0s)]
*  largest health agency in the world. Expand care to millions more Americans than ever before. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=111.64s)]
*  Negotiate the cost of prescription drugs and pull us out of a worldwide pandemic and we delivered. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=116.28s)]
*  These people just don't get it. In order for this to work, they need to give a full confession. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=122.04s)]
*  The talking point of that he was older is irrelevant. We have people that are older [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=129.4s)]
*  than the president that can still be able to do this. Chuck Grassley, he can do a press conference. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=134.28s)]
*  He knows his talking points. He knows exactly. So it's not about age. The question to the secretary [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=141.24s)]
*  and all the rest of the cabinet is, was he fit for office? And they know he wasn't. And so we [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=147.64s)]
*  need a full confession. Well, Xavier, glad that he responded. The only one of the 26 to Fox Digital [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=153.16s)]
*  applaud him for that, but he never answered the question. He skirted the issue. The question was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=159.4s)]
*  about his cognitive issues. And he said, A, I met with him. Then he said he got older, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  but Joe Biden's message was X, Y, and Z and we delivered. So I would just say one thing. He had [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=170.28s)]
*  eight cabinet meetings with no cards scripted in four years. President Trump said three already. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=176.44s)]
*  They never saw him. Austin disappeared, went to the hospital. No one even knew because they [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=182.12s)]
*  weren't in contact. There was no one just had to show signs of life every now and then. Right. But [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=186.76s)]
*  they put they then the cabinet secretary was saying we couldn't get to him anyway, which is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=191.56s)]
*  absolutely insane. Peter Doocy asked a great question to Caroline Levitt yesterday, as usual, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=196.2s)]
*  and it was about the first lady, the former first lady. There are some folks in President Biden's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=201.16s)]
*  inner circle who are now in talks with Republicans in Congress to give interviews about how they may [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=207.48s)]
*  have handled President Biden's decline. Is the president satisfied with aides only sitting for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=212.92s)]
*  these transcribed interviews or would he also like to see some kind of testimony from the former [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=220.92s)]
*  first lady, Dr. Biden? I think, frankly, the former first lady should certainly speak up about what [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  she saw in regards to her husband and when she saw it and what she knew, because I think anybody [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=231.88s)]
*  looking again at the videos and photo evidence of Joe Biden with your own eyes and a little bit of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=238.28s)]
*  common sense can see this was a clear cover up and Joe Biden, Jill Biden was certainly complicit [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=243.48s)]
*  in that cover up. There are docu there's documentation video evidence of her clearly [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  shielding her husband away from the cameras. They were just on the view last week. She was saying [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=254.28s)]
*  everything is fine. She's still lying to the American people. She still thinks the American [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=258.68s)]
*  public are so stupid that they're going to believe her lies. And frankly, it's insulting and she needs [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=262.92s)]
*  to answer for it. We're lying to the American people. She's still lying to him. I mean, all the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=267.0s)]
*  reports indicated that the family and the advisors never told the president that he's unwell. I mean, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=271.16s)]
*  that's why I keep making the the point is, did the president know that things were going off the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=277.32s)]
*  rails here? It was the family's job to tell him. It was the cabinet jobs to tell him. Look, I just [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=283.72s)]
*  think that the Democrats feel like this is just going to go away. I heard one Democrat on our [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=291.08s)]
*  airwaves say that this story is only going to last for two months. Well, maybe that would have [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=294.92s)]
*  been the case if they would just give us a full confession, but they're not. And so it's a drip, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=299.56s)]
*  drip, drip approach. And it seems like we're finding more and more out about what we knew [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=303.8s)]
*  already four years ago every single day. Yeah, he should have just dropped out because now his [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=308.6s)]
*  legacy is tainted because of all of this. In February, a few months before that disastrous [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=313.16s)]
*  debate, his doctor declared him fit to serve. So that's why James Comer wants to interview him, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  wants to interview some of the staffers. He should use his medical license for that. Well, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=324.52s)]
*  James Comer is alleging that they played a role in concealing Biden's mental decline. They might [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=328.36s)]
*  also subpoena Corrine Jean-Pierre and Jill Biden. Yeah, and I just want to just add something real [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=332.44s)]
*  quick. Now they're going after Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson say, we don't know the health of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=338.44s)]
*  this president. Are you insane? Don't do it. So just going to show you they haven't learned [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=342.76s)]
*  anything. Number one, they're trying to jam that lie down that we just found out he had cancer. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=347.64s)]
*  We know that he hasn't had a PSA test since 2014. No one could be that irresponsible. And number [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=351.88s)]
*  two is whatever you think of Trump, this is the same guy. The guy's working 20 hours a day. He [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=357.48s)]
*  gives you three press conferences. He gives you seven press conferences a week, talks you on the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=362.44s)]
*  plane, out the plane. Nobody's questioning President Trump's intellectual ability. His cholesterol [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=366.12s)]
*  is better now. They released that. He lost 20 pounds since the last time he was president. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=370.28s)]
*  He had two cataract surgeries. They found a benign polyp when he had his colonoscopy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=376.36s)]
*  They've released his medical. The accusation is just laughable. No one's taking him seriously. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfbLEl-SXLc&t=381.4s)]
