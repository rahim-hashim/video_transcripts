# 'Horrific travesty': Outrage after judge upholds plea deals for 9/11 masterminds
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI)
*  A military appeals court ruling Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin cannot rescind the plea deals [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=0.0s)]
*  of three suspects responsible for the 9-11 attacks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=6.0s)]
*  Those plea deals would have them plead guilty in exchange for being spared the possibility [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=9.8s)]
*  of the death penalty. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  Here to discuss is President of 9-11 Justice, whose father died on 9-11, Brett Eagleson. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=17.36s)]
*  Brett, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=22.48s)]
*  Just real quick, so your father, Bruce, was killed in the trade centers on 9-11 when you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  were 15, as I recall? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=33.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=35.08s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for having me this morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=36.08s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=38.68s)]
*  Now, on this story, it's kind of amazing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=40.32s)]
*  I would argue that the only reason that Secretary Austin decided to rescind this plea deal in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=43.6s)]
*  the first place was because the administration got caught out on it and you and others exposed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=51.16s)]
*  them and then they kind of ran around trying to undo it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  It was a politically motivated decision to rescind it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  We think that they knew all along that there was no way to do it, but in the heat of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=68.12s)]
*  election in the lead up to November, they were utterly called out on the carpet for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=72.36s)]
*  a horrific decision. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=77.64s)]
*  Look, I haven't heard from a single 9-11 family member that thinks this is a good idea. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=79.0s)]
*  And the reality here is that everything about 9-11, everything about this 23-year national [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=84.64s)]
*  nightmare that we've had to contend with has been a horrific travesty. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=92.56s)]
*  From the days after 9-11 when the U.S. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=97.84s)]
*  government worked with Saudi Arabia to cover up the Saudi Arabian role to the time we sent [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=99.64s)]
*  5,000 or 6,000 of our troops to be slaughtered in Iraq for no reason, to the very fact that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=105.36s)]
*  Congress just denied the benefits for the first responders, to now this, to where we're [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=111.04s)]
*  getting these terrorist sweetheart cupcake deals. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=116.92s)]
*  We've been kicked in the gut time and time again and we're sick of it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=120.2s)]
*  And we are so hopeful that we finally have a president who's going to do the right thing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=131.0s)]
*  And one thing I want to point out is that on 9-11 this year, when VP Harris and Biden [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=132.88s)]
*  sat behind the red rope at the 9-11 World Trade Center, Memorial President Trump was [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=141.84s)]
*  in a 9-11 firehouse, he was in a New York City firehouse. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=148.16s)]
*  He was there with me and I got a chance to talk to him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=151.56s)]
*  And we said to him, Mr. President, you were right in 2016 when you said it was Saudi Arabia [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=154.6s)]
*  that knocked down those towers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=160.24s)]
*  He said it on this very show on Fox and Friends. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  We said, Mr. President, we had to get the information not from the U.S. government about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=164.2s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's role, we had to get it from the British government. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  We said, Mr. President, the same people who tried to take you down in Russia, Russia, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  Russia, Bob Mueller and the deep state of this country, the same people who have blocked [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  justice for us, the same people that came up with these horrible plea deals, would you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  do something to help us? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=185.0s)]
*  And he committed to us that day in the New York City firehouse on 9-11 that if he were [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=186.88s)]
*  elected president, he was going to do the right thing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=193.12s)]
*  He said he could deal with Saudi Arabia and he was going to bring us final justice and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=195.84s)]
*  closure and we're going to hold them to account on that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=199.44s)]
*  And we're very hopeful. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  This is a new start for America. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  We have a Republican controlled Congress. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=204.0s)]
*  We have a president in the office who puts America first. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  So let's hope that he really truly does that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=209.28s)]
*  Well, I think you just gave one of the best encapsulations of the mistakes our government [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=211.08s)]
*  has made since 9-11 and I'm grateful to you for that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=215.0s)]
*  And I'm also grateful to you for staying strong and keeping on the government and exposing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=218.24s)]
*  all of this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=225.04s)]
*  So thank you, Brett Nicholson. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=226.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFBHAFP_UI&t=229.08s)]
