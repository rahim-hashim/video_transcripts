# Doocy: This is SHOCKING pollsters
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak)
*  If you look at Pennsylvania, it's got 19 electoral votes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=0.0s)]
*  The early vote so far got 1.4 million going in plus, but 58% have been Democrat, 32% have [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  been Republican. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=12.84s)]
*  So that's a significant advantage. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=14.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  And here's the thing, Politico has got a great analysis of the early voting across the battleground [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  states. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And it is shocking some pollsters because women are outpacing men in battleground states [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=24.34s)]
*  by 10 points, 55 to 45. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  The implications are unclear and you don't know exactly who they are voting for, but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=35.34s)]
*  we do know, you know, you look at the demographics, women seem to favor Kamala Harris. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=40.34s)]
*  And that explains apparently what they think is her path to winning next Tuesday because [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=47.1s)]
*  she leads in the suburbs as well, brand new Wall Street Journal poll, she's up by seven. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=54.92s)]
*  She's up by six in a brand new Ipsos poll regarding the suburbs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=61.5s)]
*  If those hold, those suburban voters would be enough to offset her giant losses in the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  black and Latino communities. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=73.06s)]
*  So her path to victory is through the suburbs, they say. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=75.38s)]
*  Well, so, Lawrence, is that, I'm curious when you talk to the folks that are there in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=79.1s)]
*  diner, do they live in the suburbs? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  Are they in the big cities? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=86.14s)]
*  Where do they live and what are their opinions? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=87.94s)]
*  Yeah, let's go talk to them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=90.02s)]
*  Let's actually talk with some folks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to hit right where we left off. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=94.14s)]
*  Hello, how you doing, ma'am? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  You're on Fox and Friends right now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=101.5s)]
*  Christina. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=102.82s)]
*  Christina. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=103.82s)]
*  I'm curious, Christina, did you hear the current president of the United States call the Trump [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  supporters garbage yesterday? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=108.74s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=110.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=111.22s)]
*  What is your thought process on this? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=112.22s)]
*  It feels very demeaning, you know? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=114.02s)]
*  I've been a Republican my whole life and it's a privilege to be a Republican and a conservative [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=116.02s)]
*  and I stand for conservative values and I think I can process thoughts and have my own [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  thought pattern and to be called garbage for those thoughts is not necessarily an uplifting [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=125.94s)]
*  comment. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=130.98s)]
*  Were you surprised? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=131.98s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=132.98s)]
*  No, not coming from him or his party. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=134.14s)]
*  Thank you so much, ma'am. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=138.14s)]
*  So as I told you from the very beginning, people were telling me this happened but they [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=140.14s)]
*  were not surprised. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk with some other folks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  So what's your name? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  Adam. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  You guys got a tight race here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure you heard the former, the current president actually talk about Trump supporters [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=151.38s)]
*  being garbage. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=156.14s)]
*  How is that going to impact you? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=157.14s)]
*  I mean, it just shows the Democrats and Harris' desperation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=158.98s)]
*  I think they're desperate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=162.58s)]
*  They see the numbers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=163.58s)]
*  They see the people, you know, all the enthusiasm behind Donald Trump and the Republicans. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=164.58s)]
*  So you know, it's just like Hillary Clinton calling us deplorables. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=169.34s)]
*  This is just part two, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=174.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=175.18s)]
*  Sir, how you doing? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=176.18s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=177.18s)]
*  It is tight here in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=178.18s)]
*  Eighty-one thousand votes separated 2020. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=180.18s)]
*  Donald Trump won it in 2016 and 2020. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=183.02s)]
*  Joe Biden won it by 81,000 votes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=185.58s)]
*  What do you think is going to be the issue that brings the majority of the folks of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=189.06s)]
*  polls? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=192.46s)]
*  Economy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=193.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=194.46s)]
*  Why the economy? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=195.46s)]
*  I just, everybody's struggling. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=196.46s)]
*  I mean, food, food's for one thing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=199.78s)]
*  I mean, let's try to get prices down on things. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=202.5s)]
*  Housing, housing's out of control. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=206.46s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=208.9s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=209.9s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=210.9s)]
*  Let's go talk with some other folks out here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=211.9s)]
*  You were fired up the moment I saw you this morning. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=214.74s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=217.22s)]
*  Tamara. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=218.38s)]
*  Tamara, I'm curious, with PA being so close, who do you think is going to win? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=219.38s)]
*  I really think that Trump will win just because the economy is so bad for people and the typical [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=225.78s)]
*  state counties like Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, those people are working people and they are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=231.1s)]
*  really feeling the crunch. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=237.34s)]
*  So I think that that makes a difference. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=238.94s)]
*  So y'all voted for Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=240.66s)]
*  2020, y'all went back to Joe, but it was only by 81,000. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=243.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=247.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=248.38s)]
*  Why is this time different? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=249.38s)]
*  I think we've had four years of failure and people are tired of it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=251.54s)]
*  They've really felt that failure at the grocery store in their own families. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=255.66s)]
*  The education system is bad. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=260.06s)]
*  The country is dangerous. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=261.74s)]
*  So these are matters that matter to me as a mom. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=264.18s)]
*  And I'm tired of that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=267.98s)]
*  I'm tired of that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=268.98s)]
*  It is personal. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=269.98s)]
*  Thank you so much, man. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=270.98s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=271.98s)]
*  Guys, so as you can see, they're talking about the issues. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=272.98s)]
*  Mom and pop stores, just being able to go to the grocery store. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=276.82s)]
*  Yeah, they're upset about what the president said about, you know, calling essentially [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=280.5s)]
*  this entire room garbage. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=286.38s)]
*  But that's not what really matters. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  What matters is when they go to the grocery store and they can't afford things. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=290.26s)]
*  Well put. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  It's all about the money. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=295.73999999999995s)]
*  Bread and butter issues. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=296.82s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=297.62s)]
*  We look at it as like these Hollywood A-listers, the coastal elites telling middle America [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  that they're garbage. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=303.82s)]
*  Thank you so much, Lawrence. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=305.02s)]
*  I think you're staying with us for this next interview with Jonathan Turley. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  So Lawrence just spoke to these voters in Lancaster County where a criminal investigation [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=310.46s)]
*  is underway after 2,500 voter registration forms were flagged for potential fraud. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=314.78s)]
*  Fox News contributor and GW University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins us right now [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  with some analysis. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=324.62s)]
*  Jonathan, good to have you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=325.62s)]
*  You know, in past elections, we've heard about problems after the election. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=327.38s)]
*  At least they're working on these things now before the election. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=332.5s)]
*  And so we know that there were like 2,500 voter registration forms. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=336.42s)]
*  There was something wrong with them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=340.7s)]
*  And so they've set them aside. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=342.38s)]
*  Is this normal or is it something bigger? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, we've seen this pattern before. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=348.5s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=349.86s)]
*  We should take a more positive view of this and that these are being picked up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=350.98s)]
*  You have people who are doing their job and pulling out these suspicious registrations. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=357.38s)]
*  But we've seen this pattern. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=363.58s)]
*  You have a sort of a cottage industry of registering people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=365.02s)]
*  There's a lot of money from the parties, from the from the government to register. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=368.73999999999995s)]
*  And they are registered by obviously the number of people that they can effectively harvest [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=373.62s)]
*  or get registrations from. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=378.5s)]
*  And that produces a rather negative incentive. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=381.14s)]
*  Some of these people begin to cut corners or, according to some of these accusations, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=384.02000000000004s)]
*  just knowingly create invalid registrations. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  So it's good that they're picking it up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=393.7s)]
*  We just don't know the scope of this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=395.18s)]
*  We're seeing this in multiple districts. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=397.06s)]
*  And that's what we don't quite know at this point. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=399.74s)]
*  Jonathan, they're saying they're looking into overabundance of voter registration forms. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  So there's I know they normally get a lot of registration forms in the mail, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=406.18s)]
*  but they're saying this is more than normal. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=410.42s)]
*  Yeah, and that's part of the thing is people there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=415.62s)]
*  A lot of states have tried to make it easier to register. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=418.06s)]
*  There's a lot of money going to registration drives. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=420.46000000000004s)]
*  But that could be a perfect storm when those are in the hands of the wrong people. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=423.34000000000003s)]
*  And so we're seeing a lot of these these forms that are highly suspicious and potentially criminal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=427.66s)]
*  But many of these are simply invalid. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=435.38s)]
*  And so these officials are trying to do a catch up game because, you know, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=437.5s)]
*  we don't have a lot of runway here when these registration forms come in. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=441.18s)]
*  They've got to spot them, pull them, investigate them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=444.34s)]
*  And we've got an election barreling down this track. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=447.73999999999995s)]
*  Right. So, John, let's Jonathan, let's take a look at some of the Supreme Court challenges. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=451.18s)]
*  They say they know they're going to play a role. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=455.62s)]
*  They said, let's get this going. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=457.14s)]
*  For example, in Virginia, they said there were some illegal immigrants, according to the governor, on those roles, wanted to clean them up. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=458.78s)]
*  They said, you can't do that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=464.06s)]
*  Where does that stand right now from what you see play out in the lower courts? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=465.7s)]
*  Well, the lower courts did not go well for the state of Virginia. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=471.53999999999996s)]
*  We're waiting for the Supreme Court's decision. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=474.5s)]
*  I have to tell you, I'm very sympathetic with Virginia here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=477.46s)]
*  You know, what Virginia is saying is quite simple. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=480.34s)]
*  They're saying it's a crime. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=482.65999999999997s)]
*  These people said that they were noncitizens and they're appearing on our voting rolls. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=484.58s)]
*  It's a crime to do that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=489.34s)]
*  And so we have what I think is a very reasonable system. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=491.02s)]
*  It gets kicked back by the DMV because of what these people said. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  And then Virginia says, cure it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=498.86s)]
*  If there's some problem with what you put down, you've got 14 days. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  And even if we reject you after 14 days, you can still vote with a provisional ballot. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  Now, for some reason, the Biden-Harris administration decided to go with the nuclear option and said, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=511.38s)]
*  we want them back on the voting rolls. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=517.9s)]
*  And two lower courts agreed with them. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=520.54s)]
*  So we're waiting to see if the Supreme Court will intervene. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=522.94s)]
*  And I think there's grounds to intervene here, but we'll see. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=526.1s)]
*  The Supreme Court is not eager to intervene in any of these cases. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=529.98s)]
*  They would like this cup to pass from their lips. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=533.86s)]
*  But this is one that may be difficult. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=536.62s)]
*  OK, you had a few others there. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=538.34s)]
*  But I didn't know they agreed not to intervene. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=539.5s)]
*  They haven't decided yet. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=541.98s)]
*  It goes to the Supreme Court now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=543.46s)]
*  The Supreme Court, I thought they did decide. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=544.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, we're waiting. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=546.3000000000001s)]
*  We're waiting for a final decision of the Supreme Court. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=549.2600000000001s)]
*  I don't believe. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=551.9000000000001s)]
*  I've not heard that they've made a final decision. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=552.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=554.5400000000001s)]
*  The Department of Justice responded yesterday. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=555.0600000000001s)]
*  That's the latest. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=557.62s)]
*  Lawrence, back to you. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=558.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Jonathan, I'm curious. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=560.98s)]
*  And I've heard from some folks here already. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=563.74s)]
*  What's going on with some of these voters lines? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=565.82s)]
*  I went to vote over the weekend. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=568.46s)]
*  The lines were long. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=570.1400000000001s)]
*  But I was told that these poll workers are allowing all the people to vote in my home [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=571.4200000000001s)]
*  state. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=576.22s)]
*  But some people have some concerns about Pennsylvania. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us what reports you're hearing on this? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=580.02s)]
*  Yeah, and this is very concerning because we actually have Fox interviews with people [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=584.9s)]
*  who are turned away around 2 30 or so in the afternoon. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=591.22s)]
*  That's before the end of the period by which you can demand these these these ballots. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=594.74s)]
*  And some of them were told they had computer problems. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=601.86s)]
*  Some said they had staffing problems. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=604.22s)]
*  And it's quite frustrating. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=606.42s)]
*  This is the key state in the election. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=608.26s)]
*  And we're now having staffing and computer problems. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=610.82s)]
*  It's it's it's not like this is rocket science. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=614.58s)]
*  You know, Elon Musk just captured a booster rocket and what looked like a grilling tong. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=617.7s)]
*  That's tough. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=624.66s)]
*  What's not tough, I would hope, would be getting out these ballots and keeping open until 5 [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  p.m. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=630.74s)]
*  Yeah, making us all wonder, will we know the results next Wednesday? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=631.38s)]
*  Almost almost. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=635.0600000000001s)]
*  It's T minus six to blast off. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=636.58s)]
*  All right, Jonathan, thank you very much for joining us live. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp62WzMNnak&t=638.5s)]
