# WATCH: Protesters block Jewish UCLA student from class
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY)
*  Okay, on UCLA's campus, a student wearing a Star of David necklace is denied entry to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=0.0s)]
*  the campus by masked pro-Palestinian activists. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=5.48s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=9.4s)]
*  We're going this way. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=11.8s)]
*  You guys have closed the entrance. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=12.8s)]
*  We are UCLA students. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=14.68s)]
*  I have my ID right here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=15.68s)]
*  I'm being blocked off, not by the security guard, but by you two. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  You three. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=21.52s)]
*  Oh, look, they're making their burger while I'm going this way. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=22.52s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=25.2s)]
*  Everybody, look at this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=26.2s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=27.2s)]
*  I'm a UCLA student. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=28.2s)]
*  I deserve to go here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=29.2s)]
*  We pay tuition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=30.68s)]
*  This is our school, and they're not letting me walk in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=31.68s)]
*  Unbelievable, but it happened, and this is the man that it happened to. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=34.92s)]
*  Eli Sivis joins us now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=38.64s)]
*  Eli, you looked like you knew what was about to happen, and you took all your composure [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=40.68s)]
*  that you could muster not to bull your way in. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=46.84s)]
*  Can you bring us back to that moment? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Of course, absolutely. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=53.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=54.0s)]
*  So, I take the same path to class every single day, and when I got there, it was blocked [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=55.44s)]
*  off by these students. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=61.6s)]
*  Not a security guard, but by these students. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=62.96s)]
*  I showed them my ID, and I said, this is the way I entered a class. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=65.36s)]
*  Please let me in. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=68.88s)]
*  When they refused, I quickly understood what was happening. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=69.96s)]
*  I handed my phone to my fellow Jewish friend, and he started filming so we could document [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=72.52s)]
*  exactly what was happening. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=76.88s)]
*  And who were those people who were denying you access to your space? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=78.4s)]
*  They could have been UCLA students. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=84.28s)]
*  They could not have been. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=86.12s)]
*  I honestly would not be surprised if they were not UCLA students, but they were part [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=87.12s)]
*  of the pro-Khamas mob that has taken over our school. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=90.86s)]
*  Were you tempted just to divide them? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  Because you're larger than they are. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  It looks like they're mostly women. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=98.6s)]
*  Could you have just gotten through them, or did you decide not to do that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  We are for peace, and we will never barge through, because we know that we're better [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=105.44s)]
*  than them in that sense. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=110.8s)]
*  Could I have? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=114.92s)]
*  But I would rather have documented that so we can show the world exactly what is going [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=115.92s)]
*  on in universities in the United States. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=119.6s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=121.72s)]
*  Eli, I'm curious. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=122.72s)]
*  I posed this question to our anchors this morning on the couch. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=125.72s)]
*  What would happen if this happened to any other minority group? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=129.96s)]
*  Do you think that there would have been more outrage over this incident, Eli? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=133.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=138.64s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=139.64s)]
*  I also think if it was an encampment that is not a pro-Khamas encampment, for example, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  say there was a KKK encampment happening, it would have been shut down immediately. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=146.11999999999998s)]
*  And I think this really shows what's going on here at college universities in the United [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  States that we are allowing these students to spread their hatred, their bigotry, and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=154.72s)]
*  their anti-Semitism against Jewish students all around the world. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=160.88s)]
*  And many Jewish students, many, feel very unsafe. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  Eli, do you think they even know what they're protesting? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=167.44s)]
*  Do they understand the history of this region? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=170.24s)]
*  Do they understand October 7th? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that a lot of them do understand and they still choose to say what they say. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=176.36s)]
*  We go to the number one public school in the world. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  These people are smart. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=185.74s)]
*  They are educated. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=186.84s)]
*  They know what they're saying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=187.84s)]
*  They know what an intifada is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=189.36s)]
*  They want an intifada. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  They want to see the mass genocide of Jews. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, Eli, it's got to be complicated being you on that campus right now because [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure some of the people in that group or some of the people who support that group, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  either in public or private, they're your classmates. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=208.56s)]
*  Some of them might be your teachers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  And they don't, from what I've seen in some of these demonstrations, they don't like the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=214.48s)]
*  fact that you're Jewish. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  That's exactly correct. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, listen, I'm a theater major. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  I go into class and I see people wearing kofi'as and I have to work with them in a small classroom [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=224.0s)]
*  setting for the next three and a half years. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=228.56s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  I get dirty looks walking down the hallways. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  People are starting to recognize my face. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=236.56s)]
*  They know who I am. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=238.36s)]
*  I see people looking at me in dirty ways. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=239.36s)]
*  But also Jewish students walk up to me and they thank me for what I'm doing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=241.78s)]
*  So as long as I am constantly advocating for the Jewish people, I feel like we're getting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=245.28s)]
*  somewhere. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=252.96s)]
*  We're doing good in this world. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=253.96s)]
*  Eli, what do your parents say? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=254.96s)]
*  Are they worried for your safety? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=255.96s)]
*  Absolutely they are. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=259.0s)]
*  I mean, just yesterday I came back to my dorm room and somebody found out where I live and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=260.0s)]
*  they wrote on my whiteboard, shame on you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=265.44s)]
*  And I just think that this is the start of something that's going to escalate very, very [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=268.32s)]
*  quickly because my face is really getting out there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=272.68s)]
*  And I would not be surprised if somebody tried something in the next couple of days. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=276.36s)]
*  Eli, keep us up to date. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=280.2s)]
*  The last question is, aren't these fundamentally anti-American initiatives too? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=286.12s)]
*  They constantly advocate for the destruction of our beautiful country. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  They burn the American flag. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=292.36s)]
*  They are super anti-America. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=294.6s)]
*  They are anti our government. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=296.38s)]
*  They're anti-democracy and shame on them for shame on UCLA and shame on actually all college [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=298.8s)]
*  administrations for allowing them to continue what they're doing because this is no longer [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=306.12s)]
*  about freedom of speech. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=310.0s)]
*  This is now straight up about promoting aggression and hatred against Jewish people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=311.72s)]
*  Eli, your star is rising. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=317.72s)]
*  You're in the right side of this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=319.4s)]
*  We will stay with you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=320.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=321.48s)]
*  And you actually do not wear a mask on campus. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=322.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=326.04s)]
*  You're proud of who you are. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=327.04s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=328.04s)]
*  I'm proud of who I am. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=329.04s)]
*  I want them to see my face. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=330.04s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=331.04s)]
*  Eli, God bless you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8wm16kjyvY&t=332.04s)]
