# 'Theatrical performance': AOC torched for 'disheartening' House floor tirade
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os)
*  So today female athletes protesting outside the NCAA convention demanding protection for women's sports [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=0.0s)]
*  Following a major win on Capitol Hill the house passing the bill banning biological males from female school teams [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  If it passes in the Senate bill was stripped funding from all schools that don't comply [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=13.08s)]
*  Our next guest was on Capitol Hill yesterday when it passed hosts of the games for girls podcast on out kick calm [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=19.1s)]
*  Riley games joins us now. Good morning, Riley [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=26.32s)]
*  Good morning. It's good to be on with you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=30.4s)]
*  So AOC had this to say about the bill. Let's watch it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=33.16s)]
*  Republicans who have voted against [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=40.76s)]
*  Consistently against the violence against women act now want to pretend today that they care about women and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=43.8s)]
*  why [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=51.8s)]
*  to open up gender and yes genital [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=52.96s)]
*  Examinations into little girls in this country in the so-called name of attacking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=57.26s)]
*  trans girls trans girls are girls [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=63.74s)]
*  Is that what this fight is about examining little girls? I mean this is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=68.3s)]
*  Just off [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's one way to put it if she spent two seconds reading the bill [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=75.06s)]
*  She would know this this has nothing to do with general inspections. This has nothing to do with any sort of anatomical [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=79.54s)]
*  examination this resorts to birth certificates and a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  Routine physical which every athlete already has to complete to be able to play their sport [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=90.42s)]
*  Anyway, and so to watch the theatrical performance [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=95.7s)]
*  Which that's exactly what it was from all pretty much all of the Democrats on the House floor [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=99.08s)]
*  It was disheartening and to continue to see them tout about women's rights and she mentions the violence against women act [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=103.54s)]
*  I do we remember how AOC voted on the violence against women's by illegal aliens act because she [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  voted in opposition [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=116.06s)]
*  So I mean look at these people look how they voted on the Lincoln Riley act look how they voted on the saved women's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=117.18s)]
*  Sports act and if they were a no on one or both then they do not get to continue to say they support women and women's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=121.68s)]
*  Rights so rather I was actually surprised when I saw it was only two [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=128.9s)]
*  Democrats from the Texas [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=133.58s)]
*  Delegation so we got some Texas Democrats that have some sense you got representative him [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=135.86s)]
*  Quay are and you got Vicente Gonzalez that voted for the bill [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  I [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=144.5s)]
*  Don't think this is a partisan issue, and I thought that the Democrats really cared about women. They're going to destroy the sport [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=145.82s)]
*  Yeah, you don't think it's a partisan issue neither does majority of Americans as made very very clear on November 5th [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  But apparently November 5th taught the Democrats nothing I was curious going into this will we see people double down? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=161.5s)]
*  Like we saw from AOC or will we see people start to slowly recant from their position and if you can remember Lawrence a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=168.26s)]
*  Few months back. I mean pretty immediately following the election you had congressman Seth Moulton [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=174.7s)]
*  He went on the news and he said looks right we've become too radical as a party. I have daughters [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=178.98s)]
*  I don't want my daughters on the court or on the field with with boys [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=184.4s)]
*  But even congressman Moulton was pressured into voting in opposition of the protection of women and girls in sports act [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=187.26s)]
*  But that tells you something it tells you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=194.38s)]
*  That more than a party what the Democrats are is it's truthfully their cult [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=196.54s)]
*  You know I do find that interesting because we interviewed the congressman [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=201.62s)]
*  And you thought that there was an epiphany on this issue to see the double down even after the election [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=205.1s)]
*  I think is truly shocking. What do you think is the end goal here? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=211.76s)]
*  Do you think in the end that you guys are gonna win this fight it passes the Senate and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=216.2s)]
*  President-elect Trump when he becomes president actually signs the bill [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=222.06s)]
*  I'm very hopeful the Senate seems to be a lot more bipartisan on these hot-button issues [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=226.7s)]
*  Then certainly the house does so I'm hopeful [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=232.46s)]
*  I don't know what the timeline looks like if you can remember remember last year the Senate totally [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=235.1s)]
*  Disavowed this issue they would not even bring it forward for a vote [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=241.5s)]
*  So nonetheless, it's a big step forward [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=244.94s)]
*  And I'm hopeful that President Trump on day one as he campaigned on will take decisive action and ultimately insured federal lines [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=246.66s)]
*  Uphold is upheld by its original intent. I [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=255.14s)]
*  Just hope that all the the women during Pete's hearing yesterday [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=258.06s)]
*  They wanted to be defenders of women vote for the bill. We'll see. Thanks Riley. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryv_xbrP4os&t=261.64s)]
