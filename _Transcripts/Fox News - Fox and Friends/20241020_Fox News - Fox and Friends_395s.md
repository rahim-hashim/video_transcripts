# Lizzo shares confusing and offensive message at Kamala Harris’ rally
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU)
*  So if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=0.0s)]
*  And starting on day one of my new administration, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=4.0s)]
*  I will end Kamala Harris' war on Pennsylvania energy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=10.0s)]
*  because you know she's going to ban — you know she's going to ban fracking, right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=15.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=19.0s)]
*  You know, she was against fracking, against all this stuff, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=23.0s)]
*  and then all of a sudden, about a year and a half ago, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=26.0s)]
*  she was getting killed in the polls. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=28.0s)]
*  She said, I like fracking very much. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=30.0s)]
*  Look, they always go back to what they want. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=32.0s)]
*  They always go back. She can't help it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=34.0s)]
*  She's a radical left Marxist. She can't help it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=37.0s)]
*  But we're going to end that, and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill, baby, drill. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=41.0s)]
*  We're going to drill, baby, drill. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=48.0s)]
*  We're going to be drilling so deep. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=52.0s)]
*  We're going to be — for these guys, we're going to drill. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=55.0s)]
*  We're going to drill. We're going to take out so much money. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=57.0s)]
*  We're going to take out so much money. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=60.0s)]
*  You look at how comfortable Donald Trump is. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=63.0s)]
*  We're going to show you a little bit in just a second here, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=66.0s)]
*  him putting on that hard hat. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=69.0s)]
*  He's been around construction buildings before and union workers many times, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=71.0s)]
*  and they feel connected to him, and he feels connected to them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=76.0s)]
*  And those guys that you're seeing behind them, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=81.0s)]
*  they're fighting for their livelihood, really. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=83.0s)]
*  They know that Donald Trump's telling the truth about Kamala Harris' record on fracking, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=85.0s)]
*  which is that she wanted to ban it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=92.0s)]
*  Here's a steelworker who joined Donald Trump on stage, and here's what he had to say. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=94.0s)]
*  The president that saved the steel industry with tariffs. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=100.0s)]
*  You saved it with tariffs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=103.0s)]
*  And you're my hero, and you're the greatest president ever. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=105.0s)]
*  We love you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=108.0s)]
*  We love you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=109.0s)]
*  We love you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=110.0s)]
*  So, steelworkers for Trump and the rank-and-file Mom Valley Works want to endorse you. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=113.0s)]
*  We want to give you a hard hat. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=120.0s)]
*  The guy, he really does. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=137.0s)]
*  He just changes all the rules about politics. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=138.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=141.0s)]
*  But one rule that he hasn't changed is, obviously, you always want the workers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=142.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris has managed to score some of the endorsements, or lack thereof, of union chiefs, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=147.0s)]
*  but Donald Trump gets the workers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=157.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=159.0s)]
*  And Kamala has sort of doubled down on relying on, say, Hollywood or superstars, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=160.0s)]
*  like who don't work with their hands for a living, and you get people like Lizzo, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=169.0s)]
*  who is a musical star, I believe. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=175.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=177.0s)]
*  She's a superstar. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=178.0s)]
*  She's a superstar. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=180.0s)]
*  Superstar. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=181.0s)]
*  She's from Detroit, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=182.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=183.0s)]
*  She's from Michigan, maybe? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=184.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=185.0s)]
*  But that's who she's relying on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=186.0s)]
*  And normally, politicians always want to be with the people, not with the rock stars. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=187.0s)]
*  But here's Lizzo. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=192.0s)]
*  I'm not going to spend any more time on the stage because we've got work to do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=193.0s)]
*  We have 17 days to get this done. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=198.0s)]
*  And we're not going to be able to get these 17 days back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=201.0s)]
*  And what I think we all know is on Election Day, we don't want to have any regrets about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=206.0s)]
*  what we could have done these next 17 days. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=212.0s)]
*  Y'all need to hear this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=215.0s)]
*  What up, though? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=216.0s)]
*  They say if Kamala wins, then this whole country will be like Detroit. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=221.0s)]
*  Well, I say proud like Detroit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=226.0s)]
*  I say resilient like Detroit. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=229.0s)]
*  This is the same Detroit that innovated the auto industry and the music industry. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=233.0s)]
*  So put some respect on Detroit's name. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=239.0s)]
*  You guys, think about that contrast. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=243.0s)]
*  So one candidate wants to do MAGA, Make America Great Again, and the other one's MADA, or [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=245.0s)]
*  Make America Detroit Again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=250.0s)]
*  Detroit, as you said, nice town, nice architecture, but definitely not a model for what we want [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=252.0s)]
*  for the rest of the country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=259.0s)]
*  But to the place where we began this conversation, the point that you're making, Charlie, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=260.0s)]
*  Detroit wasn't always that way. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=264.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of reasons that Donald Trump was appealing to those union and blue-collar [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=266.0s)]
*  voters in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=271.0s)]
*  And we often talk about the cultural issues and how he connects with them on a cultural [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=272.0s)]
*  level. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=276.0s)]
*  But, you know, I happen to, I think, be lucky enough to be born in a state and now live [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=277.0s)]
*  in a state that really benefits from a booming economy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=283.0s)]
*  I mean, you feel it on a day-to-day basis in Texas. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=286.0s)]
*  Fortune 500 companies, people moving to Texas. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=289.0s)]
*  The point is, there was a time in American history, and it's not all gone, where from [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=293.0s)]
*  Michigan to Pennsylvania, this was the heart of American manufacturing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=298.0s)]
*  And two things have assaulted that idea. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=301.0s)]
*  Two things have assaulted that reality. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=303.0s)]
*  One, undercut competition from overseas, places like China. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=305.0s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump brings up tariffs. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=309.0s)]
*  Globalism. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=311.0s)]
*  But also, just an incredibly burdensome regulatory state and a corrupt political class that has [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=312.0s)]
*  made it an unfriendly place to do business and allowed Detroit to rot from within and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=317.0s)]
*  allowed so much of that to leave Pennsylvania. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=322.0s)]
*  And I think that while we do focus on the cultural connection, this is about people's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=325.0s)]
*  livelihoods and what was. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=330.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=332.0s)]
*  And this is why it is called Make America Great Again, and what you would hope could [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=333.0s)]
*  one day again be in all of those states, from Pennsylvania through Ohio all the way to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=336.0s)]
*  Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=341.0s)]
*  And they believe him because they saw it happen, right? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=342.0s)]
*  I lived in one of those manufacturing towns that was sort of depressed and kind of going [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=345.0s)]
*  under, and then Donald Trump came in and things were on the up and up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=350.0s)]
*  And I remember going with Sean into a welding factory, a factory where they're welding, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=354.0s)]
*  and the welders had written Trump on their welding hats. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=359.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=364.0s)]
*  Because they knew who brought this back. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=365.0s)]
*  And so this connection that you see, this love, as you said, not with the union bosses, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=367.0s)]
*  as Charlie pointed out, but with the workers, is not just because they believe he can do [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=372.0s)]
*  it, it's because he did do it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=377.0s)]
*  And then it stopped, and now he wants to bring back American energy and American manufacturing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=379.0s)]
*  back. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=384.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=385.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPW37-j2npU&t=386.0s)]
