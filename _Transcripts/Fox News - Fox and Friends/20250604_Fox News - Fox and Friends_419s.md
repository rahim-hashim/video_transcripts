# Peter Doocy: This got EVERYONE'S attention
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME)
*  Meanwhile, President Trump's big, beautiful bill, already facing hurdles in the Senate, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=0.0s)]
*  now facing some heat from Elon Musk. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=4.36s)]
*  Peter Deuces live at the White House with the details. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=7.18s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=9.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=10.28s)]
*  And President Trump thinks this is simple. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=11.28s)]
*  He now says about the big, beautiful bill, so many false statements are being made about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=12.74s)]
*  the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=17.1s)]
*  But what nobody understands is that it's the single biggest spending cut in history by [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  far. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=22.72s)]
*  There will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=23.72s)]
*  The president's problem, though, right now is that he's losing some Republicans he needs [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=26.96s)]
*  in the Senate, like Rand Paul. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  When Elon Musk posts that Congress is making America bankrupt, Rand Paul writes, some of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=33.0s)]
*  us are trying to stop that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  And the president responded to Paul. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=40.44s)]
*  He said Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially of the tremendous growth [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=42.96s)]
*  that is coming. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=49.08s)]
*  He loves voting no on everything. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=50.08s)]
*  He thinks it's good politics, but it's not. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=51.8s)]
*  The BBB is a big winner. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=53.84s)]
*  The one thing that got everybody's attention yesterday here at the White House was this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=56.44s)]
*  post from Elon Musk. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=59.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=61.76s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=64.52s)]
*  How mad do you think President Trump is going to be when he finds out that Elon Musk said, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=75.28s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=79.4s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=81.36s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=86.92s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=88.52s)]
*  You know it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=89.52s)]
*  Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=90.52s)]
*  It doesn't change the president's opinion. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=93.0s)]
*  This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=94.68s)]
*  And last night I was sent by some sources familiar with the drama behind the scenes [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=98.12s)]
*  an article that appeared in Axios that says, Musk was upset that the big, beautiful bill [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=102.92s)]
*  cuts an electric vehicle tax credit that he thinks hurts Tesla, also that one of his [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  friends didn't get picked to NASA, that the FAA didn't use Starlink for air traffic control, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  and that he was not allowed to get an extension on his status as a special government employee. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=126.4s)]
*  All right, Peter, very interesting where we go now because, thank you very much, I mean [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=127.4s)]
*  because it's no big deal if Chuck Schumer's insulting the bill. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  When Rand Paul and Tom Massey tend to be heretics anyway, they don't want to get their [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=136.84s)]
*  hands dirty, they just want to criticize, unlike Ron Johnson who says, I don't like [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=141.16s)]
*  elements of the bill but I want to make it better. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=145.04s)]
*  That's to me the right approach. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=147.0s)]
*  Ted Cruz, same thing, right approach. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=148.24s)]
*  But I think the Elon Musk thing really caught the president by surprise. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=150.28s)]
*  And I hear he is furious, but I think he's so smart to keep his powder dry because he [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=153.32s)]
*  just plays into what critics would have to say, the right can't get out of their own [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=159.0s)]
*  way. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=165.32s)]
*  You have a goal, pass it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk is not in the Senate or the House, don't worry about it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=168.76s)]
*  Can I offer a different perspective, Ainsley? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=172.16s)]
*  As someone who is supportive of the president's agenda, I am upset with Congress right now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=174.88s)]
*  I don't blame the president for the big beautiful bill. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=180.88s)]
*  I blame Congress because they go to their constituents every single election and they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=184.24s)]
*  say they're going to cut spending, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, and it doesn't seem like [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=188.76s)]
*  there's a willingness to do that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=192.92s)]
*  The same thing for the salt deduction. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=196.28s)]
*  It's not conservative at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=197.28s)]
*  We should not be subsidizing California and New York. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think from Elon's perspective, you're going to see him getting involved in the primary [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=202.44s)]
*  process. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=207.4s)]
*  Now the president has a different goal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=208.4s)]
*  He has to get the bill passed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=209.68s)]
*  He has to bring people together. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=210.84s)]
*  And he understands that it's hanging on by a thread. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  So of course he's going to have that position. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=215.56s)]
*  But I don't think Elon is anti-MAGA now or anti-the president now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  He worked so hard, put a lot of stuff on the line to get a lot of wasteful stuff cut, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=222.96s)]
*  and it doesn't seem like Congress is showing that same willingness. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=228.16s)]
*  I thought Elon was very respectful in some of the original interviews, just saying, look, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  we have differences. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't agree with him on everything. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  But this latest comment about calling the big beautiful bill a disgusting abomination, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=236.84s)]
*  I was shocked to hear him say that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=242.24s)]
*  I can understand why the president would not be happy about that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=243.8s)]
*  This is someone who worked on his team. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=246.56s)]
*  But you don't have to agree completely. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=248.94s)]
*  And Lawrence, I understand your thoughts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=252.24s)]
*  But when I look at this bill, if it is going to increase the deficit, and we're going to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=254.72s)]
*  play a sound bite from John Thune that you had a great interview with him on radio where [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  he says that's not going to happen, but you're getting so many other cuts. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=262.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has said, if we don't pass this big beautiful bill, your taxes are going to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=265.6s)]
*  go up 65%. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=269.6s)]
*  Which is true. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=270.6s)]
*  These tax cuts happen in 2017. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=271.6s)]
*  He wants to extend them, not only extend them, make them permanent. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=273.44s)]
*  So I'm all in favor of that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=276.06s)]
*  I don't want 65% of my paycheck taken out or them to increase even that much. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=278.52s)]
*  I also like no tax on tips. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  I was a server for many, many years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  Y'all probably were too. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  Many people out there look at Nevada. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=288.44s)]
*  That's their livelihood. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  So I love that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  No tax on Social Security. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  If you're living on a fixed income, we interviewed a million people in those diners. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=294.2s)]
*  That's just going to be tax breaks. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  They're not going to, you're going to still pay tax on Social Security. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  They're going to substitute that for tax breaks. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=301.2s)]
*  I thought it was no tax on Social Security. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=303.08s)]
*  That was the goal, but they made an excuse. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=306.72s)]
*  But it's going to be better than it was, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=307.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=308.72s)]
*  It's going to be lower. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=309.72s)]
*  So that's what, when I look at the big picture, that's better. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=310.72s)]
*  But John, here's John Thune's interview on your radio show. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=313.92s)]
*  He says it's not going to add to the deficit. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=316.36s)]
*  Listen up. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=318.36s)]
*  Well, this will lead to higher deficits. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=319.36s)]
*  The answer to that is no. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=321.76s)]
*  You're going to get growth in the economy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=323.12s)]
*  And when the economy again is growing and expanding, you get more government revenue. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=325.0s)]
*  Add to that the almost a couple trillion dollars in cuts that are in the bill, and you have [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=328.0s)]
*  the most significant reduction in spending and biggest amount of savings in history in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=333.08s)]
*  this legislation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  So, and if you look at CBO Brian in the past, they've been, you know, they have a long [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  history of just flat being wrong. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=344.96s)]
*  They scored the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the economy grew 5% more than what they [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p0G50FREME&t=346.96s)]
