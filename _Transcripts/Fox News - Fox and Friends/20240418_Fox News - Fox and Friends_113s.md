*  decided to wait. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=7.9s)]
*  Yep, Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv to find, tell us when will they actually strike, if [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=9.14s)]
*  at all? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=14.26s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=15.26s)]
*  Israeli forces remain on high alert across the country, waiting for orders from the country's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  war cabinet to strike back against Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=23.42s)]
*  News indicate that strikes against the Islamic Republic were called off on two separate occasions [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=26.98s)]
*  over the past several days. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=32.7s)]
*  We do know the Israelis are waiting for the right operational window to respond to the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=34.58s)]
*  drone and missile attack over the weekend. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=38.32s)]
*  Iran's top officials are threatening immediate retaliation if such a strike takes place, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  forcing the Israelis to consider the Jewish holiday of Passover that starts on Monday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=45.86s)]
*  With that in mind, the Israeli army is getting ready for the possibility of another Iranian [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=50.46s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=54.38s)]
*  With a direct attack from Iran pending, Israel is still continuing to strike Iran's largest [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=55.5s)]
*  proxy in the region, Hezbollah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=60.02s)]
*  Yesterday Israel struck deep inside Lebanon targeting Hezbollah's air defense units. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=62.14s)]
*  The strikes followed a drone attack by Hezbollah that injured 14 Israeli soldiers and four [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=66.7s)]
*  civilians in northern Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=71.32s)]

*  Guys, back to you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=81.42s)]
*  Hey Trey, they did take out two Hezbollah leaders. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=82.58s)]
*  Is that related to the retaliation in any way you think? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=85.06s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=89.9s)]
*  The Israelis are trying to send a message to Hezbollah that if they get more directly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=90.9s)]
*  involved in the fight and target major Israeli population centers, there will be a heavy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  price to pay. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLV5dWwyxcg&t=98.34s)]
