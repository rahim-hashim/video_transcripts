# Netanyahu: Hamas 'refuses to make a deal' on cease-fire, hostage release
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo)
*  Fox News alert right now. The IDF, the IDF releasing this video of the Gaza tunnel where they found six hostages [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=0.0s)]
*  that were executed by Hamas. The same terrorist Israel is now being pressured to make a deal with. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=7.28s)]
*  At issue, the Philadelphia corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border. You're seeing the map. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=14.64s)]
*  Hamas' lifeline to smuggle weapons for nearly the last two decades through its maze of tunnels underneath. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=19.28s)]
*  They say those tunnels go about 500 square miles through Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=25.84s)]
*  joins us live from Jerusalem right now. Mr. Prime Minister, thanks so much for your time. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=32.0s)]
*  Jerusalem Post is reporting that you're 90% there in negotiations with Hamas towards a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=37.36s)]
*  Would you say that's accurate? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=44.56s)]
*  No, it's exactly inaccurate. There's a story, a narrative out there that there's a deal out there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=49.28s)]
*  In fact, while we agreed in July and in May and July and in August to a deal and to an American [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=54.96s)]
*  proposal, Hamas has consistently said no to every one of them. They don't agree to anything. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=63.2s)]
*  Not to the Philadelphia corridor, not to the keys of exchanging hostages for jail terrorists, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=68.32s)]
*  not to anything. So that's just a false narrative. They just want us out of Gaza so they can retake [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=74.8s)]
*  Gaza and do as they vowed to do. The November 7th massacre, again the butchery, again and again [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=80.72s)]
*  and again. And you saw how horrible this butchery is the other day when they murdered in cold blood [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=88.16s)]
*  six of our hostages. So to ask Israel to make concessions after this murder is to send a message [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=93.76s)]
*  to Hamas, murder more hostages, you'll get more concessions. That's the wrong thing to do. And I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=101.28s)]
*  think the Israeli public overwhelmingly is united against that. It looks like the hostages, the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=106.72s)]
*  condition, they were famished. They were starving to death in those tunnels. What else can you tell [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=111.2s)]
*  us about the condition of those six? It's a horrible thing. You know, Brian, I visited the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=117.44s)]
*  families. One of the families, I talked to some others, they're broken. You know, we had worked [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=126.56s)]
*  so hard to get them out. I made a deal a few months ago where we got more than half of our [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=134.8s)]
*  hostages out and more than half of the living hostages out. And we're doing everything we can [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=141.44s)]
*  to get the remainder. But Hamas consistently refuses to make a deal. So it's not true. No, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=146.72s)]
*  the report that there's a deal out there and that the only thing holding it up is the Philadelphia [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=152.8s)]
*  tunnel is not merely not true. It's just a direct falsehood. What we have to do is to make sure that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=156.96s)]
*  we do two things. One, get the hostages out. That's why I'm wearing this yellow pin. And second, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=163.92s)]
*  keep the red lines that are necessary for Israel's security and survival. And I think both of them [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=168.88s)]
*  go through holding the Philadelphia corridor because that presses Hamas. That prevents them [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  from rearming. It prevents Gaza from becoming this Iranian terror enclave again, which can [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  threaten our existence. But it's also the way to prevent them from smuggling hostages that they [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=185.6s)]
*  keep through the ceasefire into Egypt, into the Sinai, where they could disappear. And then they'll [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=191.2s)]
*  end up in Iran or in Yemen and they're lost forever. So if you want to release the hostages [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  and you want to make sure that Gaza doesn't pose a threat to Israel again, you've got to keep the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  Philadelphia corridor, which is the entry gate of Iran, to Gaza firmly in Israel's hands. And that's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=207.44s)]
*  what we're really doing right now. And you found huge tunnels there that allowed Hamas to be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=215.6s)]
*  resupplied, and that's why you want to hold it. But your defense minister reportedly says you don't [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=220.4s)]
*  need to hold it as part of this negotiation. Defense Minister Golan, number one, is that true? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  And what do you say to him? Well, no, he didn't say—he said that we could leave and come back [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=230.0s)]
*  after 42 days. Number one, it doesn't solve the problem of once we leave and we're not physically [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=237.76s)]
*  there, that they could smuggle hostages, remaining hostages, out. And the only way we can prevent that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=244.16s)]
*  is actually by being there. And secondly, you know, we had a discussion in the cabinet about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=249.76s)]
*  this, and we're a country with an army and not an army with a country. And overwhelmingly, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=253.92s)]
*  the cabinet voted to stay there for the simple reason that once we leave, there'll be enormous [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  pressure on us not to go back in. When we left Gaza the first time in 2005, people said, you know, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=264.32s)]
*  the first time they fire a rocket, you can come back in there. It's been 20 years and we didn't [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=270.4s)]
*  come back in. And we've had this in other fronts as well. We know that when we're there, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=275.28s)]
*  that we don't have to go back in and pay an exorbitant price, and God knows how many lives [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=280.64s)]
*  would be lost. So I think the cabinet made a firm decision. The people of Israel overwhelmingly [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=286.32s)]
*  are there. It's a democracy. People can protest, but the public is solidly behind the position [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  that the cabinet took. We stay in there. We keep working for a deal. We keep working for something [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=296.55999999999995s)]
*  that will release our hostages, and we just have to do both things at once. We have to keep the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=302.72s)]
*  pressure, the pressure on Hamas, and when we hold Philadelphia, we're really holding them by the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=308.0s)]
*  choke point. And the second thing is we keep trying, we keep trying to get our hostages out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=313.12s)]
*  I'm committed to that with every fiber of my being. Mr. Prime Minister, NBC has a report today [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  that American hostage family, and there's four remaining, are pressing President Biden's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=323.36s)]
*  administration to make a deal with Hamas and just go over you, go through you. That doesn't include [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=328.0s)]
*  Israel. Have you heard that? Is this true? Would you allow that? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=333.04s)]
*  I don't know. Look, I don't judge the families. I mean, they're going through enormous anguish. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=340.32s)]
*  You know, some of them went through this horrible anguish of worrying about the fate of their loved [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=345.6s)]
*  ones to grieving about those that were murdered in cold blood. I lost my own brother in the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=351.28s)]
*  rescue of hostages when he led the rescue mission at Antibes. I myself was wounded [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=357.92s)]
*  in a hostage rescue operation. I can understand their anguish, so I'm not judging them. But I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=362.8s)]
*  think we have a responsibility both to get the hostages out, but also to prevent Gaza from [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=369.2s)]
*  becoming the terror enclave again. And ultimately, Israel is a democracy, and the government decides [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=374.56s)]
*  how to balance these two needs, and that's what we're doing. It's a tough thing, but that's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=380.16s)]
*  what we're doing right now. I can't imagine tougher, and no one's got a tougher job right [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=384.72s)]
*  now than you. How much harder was your job made when President Biden came out and said that you [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=387.76s)]
*  could be doing more towards a ceasefire and a resolution? Well, I don't know what the president [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=394.48s)]
*  meant by that. You have to ask him, but I'll give you the facts. In July, we put forward a proposal [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  that Secretary Blinken called extraordinarily generous. In August, we accepted an American [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=410.64s)]
*  proposal, a U.S.-backed proposal. Hamas refused. In August 16th, there was a final bridging [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=415.68s)]
*  proposal, which we also accepted. Hamas refused. Two days ago, three days ago, the Sinoir's deputy, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=426.4s)]
*  the deputy of Hamas' chief, said that they don't want any deal. They just want Israel out. They [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=434.16s)]
*  don't care for any of these conditions. Israel has to leave. They have to take over the Gaza Strip, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=442.72s)]
*  and you know that they vowed to do October 7th massacre again and again and again, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=447.68s)]
*  where they butchered our people, raped our women, murdered them, beheaded our men, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=451.68s)]
*  burned babies alive, and took hostages. We're not going to let that happen again. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=455.44000000000005s)]
*  Hamas is not there with a deal. There's not a deal in the making, unfortunately. That still [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  hasn't happened. They want to reconstitute their terror kingdom. Unfortunately, it's not close, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=466.08s)]
*  but we'll do everything we can to get them to the point where they do make a deal, and at the same [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  time, we prevent Iran from resupplying Gaza as this great terror enclave right next to Tel Aviv, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=477.12s)]
*  right next to our major cities. Mr. Prime Minister, what do you say to critics who say that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  you're extending this conflict in order to stay in power, that it's for your political gain for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=488.24s)]
*  this to go on? What's your reaction to that? I'm not interested in my political future. I'm [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=493.12s)]
*  interested in my country's future. This war would be over yesterday if Hamas laid down its arms, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=500.8s)]
*  released all the hostages. It'll be over in two seconds, but Hamas is refusing to do that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  The obstacle to the end of this war is Hamas. The obstacle to the release of hostages is Hamas. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=512.8s)]
*  The ones who butchered and are slaying, murdering six people in cold blood, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=519.52s)]
*  riddling them with bullets and then firing bullets into their heads is Hamas. It's not Israel. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=524.9599999999999s)]
*  It's not me. We'll do everything we can to fight these savages, and it's a savagery that not only [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=531.12s)]
*  endangers Israel, it endangers all democracies. And if we come to the point where—and look, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=536.72s)]
*  I have red lines. They were set before this massacre, this latest murder, but they become [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=542.4s)]
*  redder. I have areas of flexibility. I've given them to my negotiating team, and I stand by them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=549.44s)]
*  But now, to go and make concessions after these murders, it's a license to kill hostages. That's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=557.2s)]
*  what Hamas will understand. Kill hostages, get concessions. That's just wrong. It's not the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=565.28s)]
*  right way to do it. And, you know, governments and leaders have a responsibility to do the right [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=570.24s)]
*  thing. You have—your heart goes out, and I certainly—my heart was shattered. Our hearts [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=574.24s)]
*  were torn when we saw this. But we also have the responsibility of judgment to do what is important [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=580.0s)]
*  to secure the future of the country. We can't let Iran resupply the terrorists in Gaza, and at the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=586.0s)]
*  same time, we have to continue to put the pressure on Hamas. That's where the pressure should be [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=592.4s)]
*  directed. So, in any case, these are the facts. Israel agreed to a deal. Hamas has refused. It's [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  still refusing to budge. And the pressure should be put on Hamas, not on Israel. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. And you—again, to reiterate, a deal is not close. Mr. Prime Minister, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=608.72s)]
*  thanks so much. Appreciate it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=613.76s)]
*  and most compelling analysis. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEFY57vnpo&t=622.4s)]
