# Trey Yingst: Israel kills Hamas battalion commander after striking Hamas stronghold
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo)
*  Fox News alert Israel continued to target Hamas hot spots in Gaza but the ground fighting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=0.0s)]
*  comes with a heavy toll. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  The IDF confirming that 10 of the soldiers were killed last night while fighting in northern [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=9.24s)]
*  Gaza that brings the Israeli soldier death toll now to 12. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=14.44s)]
*  And right now foreign nationals have been granted access to leave Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=18.76s)]
*  This is great news through the Rafah Gate crossing over in Egypt. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=22.32s)]
*  That's right there are about 400 people waiting to get out. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=26.64s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel with the latest where it is 12 noon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Trey good afternoon to you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=35.08s)]
*  Yeah hey guys good morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=37.36s)]
*  I do want to start with those numbers from the Israeli military. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=40.28s)]
*  They've confirmed an additional 10 of their soldiers were killed in battles with Hamas [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=43.68s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=48.82s)]
*  That adds to the two they announced yesterday from a reconnaissance unit that were killed [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=50.44s)]
*  in similar battles. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=54.96s)]
*  It really gives you a sense of what they are facing inside Gaza in terms of the breakdown. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=56.78s)]
*  These soldiers some of them were killed by an RPG that was fired by Hamas militants. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=62.36s)]
*  Others were killed by an anti-tank guided missile that was fired at an armored vehicle [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=67.4s)]
*  inside the strip. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=72.08s)]
*  And so despite the thousands of soldiers that are participating in this ground portion of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=73.54s)]
*  the operation to destroy Hamas it is a very dangerous battlefield for those soldiers and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=78.08s)]
*  the Israelis say they are preparing for more difficult days of battle ahead. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=84.04s)]
*  I do want to shift to the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern part of the strip. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=88.8s)]
*  This was considered a Hamas stronghold and a place where the Israelis were facing fierce [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=92.84s)]
*  resistance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=98.0s)]
*  They say in a strike yesterday they killed Ibrahim Bayari the commander for the entire [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=99.0s)]
*  Jabalia battalion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=103.72s)]
*  This is a man they were seeking to kill as part of one of the people that not only participated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=105.72s)]
*  in the planning for the October 7th massacre but also that was leading the Hamas fighters [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza to kill more Israeli soldiers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  I will say there are new questions from the Israeli military to the Israeli military rather [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=118.3s)]
*  about the civilian casualties surrounding this camp. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=122.78s)]
*  Questions about how many civilians were there and how many they knew would be killed as [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  a result of this strike. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=129.98s)]
*  Additionally though you talk about the Rafa crossing between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=131.74s)]
*  Some good news today amid this horrific story. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  We are seeing images of ambulances taking injured Palestinians out to go to Egyptian [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=138.58s)]
*  hospitals and the Egyptians say 500 foreign nationals will be allowed out of Gaza today [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=142.94s)]
*  as part of this deal that was negotiated by Qatar. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=148.82s)]
*  Guys so who is actually screening them Trey? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=151.78s)]
*  Did they get that far because the big worry is Hamas gets out or the hostages come out [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  with people with Hamas and they end up scurrying throughout the Middle East. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=162.02s)]
*  Do they have a process of screening? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=166.66s)]
*  So we understand the list is being reviewed by the Israelis and it's also being reviewed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=171.5s)]
*  by Egyptian intelligence officials. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=176.38s)]
*  It is a great question in all of this because there will certainly be people trying to get [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  out of Gaza from the leadership of Hamas but it's important to distinguish between the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=183.1s)]
*  Hamas leadership that will try to flee likely in the coming days and weeks and also the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=189.18s)]
*  civilians that have to get out including the American citizens. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=193.26s)]
*  We should note here though there are some Americans still in Gaza who will not get out [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=196.5s)]
*  today. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=200.66s)]
*  I've been talking with one woman and I just want to play you a few seconds of a voice [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=201.66s)]
*  note she sent me eight minutes ago and she says this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=203.98s)]
*  Jordanian American passport and his name went through today to leave Gaza with the Jordanian [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=207.54s)]
*  passport and he's 10 years old without me. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=212.98s)]
*  Okay so what that woman there is saying her son has an American and a Jordanian passport [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=216.22s)]
*  she has an American passport. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=221.54s)]
*  She is a Palestinian American she lives in Utah and she says that the list today included [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=223.7s)]
*  her son's name a 10 year old but not her name and so that just illustrates further the complexities [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=229.54s)]
*  of what's taking place. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  People aren't going to leave or allow their children to leave without them joining them [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=236.26s)]
*  and so it's an incredibly challenging situation on the ground but she is very frustrated about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  what's taking place and she says there's been a lack of communication from the State Department [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=245.54s)]
*  about when to go to the border and when she'll actually be able to make it home to the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=250.86s)]
*  Trey is there anyone from the State Department on the ground helping navigate this? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=254.86s)]
*  I know we have a U.S. General's three-star helping with some of the military operation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=260.1s)]
*  but from a U.S. interest standpoint is there anyone from the State Department there to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=265.3s)]
*  navigate it? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=271.22s)]
*  So there are people in Israel but not in Gaza and this is an important note because yesterday [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=274.62s)]
*  you heard the Biden administration sort of touting this idea that they've been talking [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=279.78s)]
*  with aid organizations inside Gaza to get more information about the Americans that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  are trapped there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  Reality on the ground is that they have no one inside Gaza. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  There are American citizens that we've talked to over the past week that say they are running [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=293.76s)]
*  low on food and clean water and many people including the woman that I just played her [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  voice message she says she's been told by the State Department to go to the Rafa crossing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=302.73999999999995s)]
*  multiple times over the past several weeks she's gotten there risked her life to go amid [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=308.1s)]
*  this active war zone only to be turned around and so this is a critical part of the story [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  and despite the fact that 500 foreign nationals are likely to leave Gaza today as part of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=318.3s)]
*  this Qatari and Egyptian deal it's not all of them and there will still be American citizens [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=323.42s)]
*  trapped inside Gaza at the end of the day today. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=328.26000000000005s)]
*  And they're waiting to go. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  Trey we couldn't take some sort of a ship or use we have ships there could we not [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=332.1s)]
*  pick up these Americans that are there in the Gaza Strip area using the Mediterranean Sea. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=338.3s)]
*  That's a really great question and it's actually being discussed not only by the U.S. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  government but also by some of the private organizations we've been talking to you might [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=350.9s)]
*  remember back during the war in Ukraine that is still ongoing right now but the early days [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  of that conflict you had all of these Americans often veterans that would would go and try [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  to rescue people from the war zone. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=364.1s)]
*  Those conversations are taking place now as the clock ticks on and people are still trapped [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=366.5s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=371.3s)]
*  So that is one possibility that's being floated and there are also European governments including [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=372.3s)]
*  the French and the Germans. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=377.1s)]
*  They've talked about using aid ships to basically take injured Palestinians out through the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=378.5s)]
*  Mediterranean Sea to places like Egypt and get them care that they much need. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=383.70000000000005s)]
*  It looks like they're just waiting for them to open the gates and away they go. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  Trey thank you very much for the great report from Israel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=392.5s)]
*  Trey can I just ask you one quick question about the hostages. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  Is it true the American commanders are on the ground helping locate the 200 plus hostages [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  many of which are Americans. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=403.1s)]
*  The New York Times has that story some others are running with it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=405.3s)]
*  What do you hear? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=408.1s)]
*  I want to be really careful with this question only because we have some agreements with [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=412.1s)]
*  our sources about what's taking place but I can tell you there is a broad effort on [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=416.5s)]
*  the ground to try and get those hostages especially the American citizens out and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=420.5s)]
*  if I could just for a moment describe a conversation I just had about an hour ago my team and I [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=425.3s)]
*  went to an area to interview the family members of two people that are being held hostage [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=430.1s)]
*  inside Gaza and they say they are so worried that the hostages will be forgotten about [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=435.7s)]
*  and this mother was talking about her son and you could just see in her eyes the fear [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=441.3s)]
*  that her son will be forgotten and so it's an important question and one we should remember [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=445.3s)]
*  there are still 240 people being held by Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=449.5s)]
*  Yeah the number only seems to grow. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=453.5s)]
*  Trey thanks. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqgYRqmQrIo&t=455.5s)]
