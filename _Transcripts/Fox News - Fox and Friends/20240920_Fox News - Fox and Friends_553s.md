# Ainsley Earhardt: This was all propaganda
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU)
*  And let's start with this on this Friday. Today, Vice President Harris will be making [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=0.0s)]
*  campaign stops in two battleground states, first in Georgia before heading north to a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  rally this evening in Wisconsin. Those events follow a star studded virtual rally that Harris [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=11.88s)]
*  held with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan yesterday. Video calling into the event were a list celebrities [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=18.72s)]
*  like Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Ben Stiller, just to name a few. While Harris was mixing it up [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=24.4s)]
*  with the rich and famous, Americans are voicing their concern about the economy. A new Fox News [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=31.36s)]
*  poll showing that the majority of voters believe high prices for groceries, housing and gas are a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=36.4s)]
*  major problem for their families. Yep, those concerns will likely be reflected in the presidential [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=41.76s)]
*  election, which I think is coming up soon. High prices rank as the most important. Why else would [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=47.28s)]
*  we put it in bold in the prompter? That's a factor driving voters to the polls this November. And [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=51.84s)]
*  that just hit. And now even Joe Biden's getting the message. Joe Biden's been saying, you know, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=58.88s)]
*  things that were not there yet, it's not time for a victory lap. He finally gets it. She's saying, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  I feel your pain, but she has no idea how to fix it. And President Trump's been saying this for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=68.48s)]
*  the last three and a half years. So it doesn't matter what the stock market is. Don't tell me [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  the inflation's going in the right direction. Both things, one might be up, one might be going [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=78.08s)]
*  down, but no, it's not going down. And when I went into the stands in the Nassau Coliseum, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=81.76s)]
*  the first person I asked, I said, why are you here today? She goes, I'm here to vote for Trump. I go, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=87.12s)]
*  why have over Trump? She said mayonnaise was $3. Now it's 750. I'm like, so it's the mayonnaise [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  that put her over the top. Thank goodness. It's the good stuff. It's the Hellman's. It was very [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=98.0s)]
*  expensive. We talked about that when it was shooting up during the supply chain problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=101.84s)]
*  So we know that the polls show that they are in a dead heat all across the country. They are tied, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=106.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. They are tied. So the Kamala Harris campaign is trying to do things [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=113.84s)]
*  to get people who normally would not vote interested in the election. And that's why [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=119.44s)]
*  they had that special event last night called Unite for America right there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=124.88s)]
*  At one point toward the end, 300,000 people were on YouTube, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=129.44s)]
*  hundreds of thousands more on social media and stuff like that. But to the point earlier where [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=133.52s)]
*  we showed you how impactful the price of stuff is, that is what everybody wanted to hear Kamala Harris, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=138.08s)]
*  woman left screen, asked about. And she was by a Pennsylvania voter, wanted to know how she's going [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=145.28s)]
*  to bring down the cost of mayonnaise and everything else. Watch. We really would love to know what your [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=153.12s)]
*  plan is to help lower the cost of living. Yeah. First of all, thank you both for being here. And [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=160.0s)]
*  yours is a story I hear around the country as I travel. And in terms of both rightly having [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  the right to have aspirations and dreams and ambitions for your family and working hard and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  finding that the American dream is for this generation and so many recently far more elusive [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=188.72s)]
*  than it's been. And we need to deal with that. And there are a number of ways. One is bringing [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=196.0s)]
*  down the cost of everyday necessities, including groceries. So that's why I'm taking on, for example, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=201.27999999999997s)]
*  price gouging, which is when, you know, most companies and corporations are good, but for [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=207.2s)]
*  those bad ones, they take advantage of people, especially during a pandemic or extreme weather, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=213.44s)]
*  and they end up jacking up prices. He's going to go after companies for, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=218.72s)]
*  it's price control. And every company has said they're not for this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=223.44s)]
*  You know what I realized by watching this? Two things. Oprah Winfrey is so talented as a host. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=227.44s)]
*  She was able to save when she had to save her several times. She was going off on tangents [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=232.72s)]
*  and Oprah would jump in and say, so what you're saying is I also realize the truth doesn't matter. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=237.52s)]
*  This is all propaganda and propaganda seems to rule. And what they want to do is take [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=243.04s)]
*  Americans money, hardworking Americans money, and they want to increase taxes and they want [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  to take your money. And this is why the teamsters did not endorse Kamala Harris. They all hate [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=253.92s)]
*  Donald Trump at all costs. And they bring in Hollywood, they bring in Julia Roberts, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  they bring in Bryan Cranston, Chris Rock, Meryl Streep. People are tired of hearing from celebrities [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=263.28s)]
*  because they're not relatable. They are the coastal elites. And Trump is up against the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=268.96s)]
*  blue state and he's up against big tech and he's up against the Hollywood elite. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=273.12s)]
*  You know, I was looking for, look, you can be a Democrat, you can be a progressive. I don't care. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=277.68s)]
*  Most of my friends are and I love them. But I was waiting for a real moment from someone in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=282.08s)]
*  audience or Oprah Winfrey to say, okay, what do you mean? She actually did say that. Just like, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=288.56s)]
*  like, just give me, like after the word, word salad and all of that, but how does that help though? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=295.6s)]
*  Like how does that, how is that aspirational thing and all of that gonna make my life better? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=302.48s)]
*  This is what's scary. It's not even like, Bernie Sanders would be scared to leave the country, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  but you knew exactly who's going to take it. Yes. She is going out of her way either not to reveal [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=314.24s)]
*  or she does not know what she's going to do. Either she's scared to death of revealing what [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=318.32s)]
*  she believes or she has no idea and she just is going to have a bunch of advisors lead this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=322.96s)]
*  country to the left, just like they, uh, Joe Biden did. She really has no answers. It is like giving [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=330.08s)]
*  an oral book report when you didn't read the book and you think you're snowing everyone in the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=335.28s)]
*  classroom, but you're not and you get an F. She had no answers to what are you going to do for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  the economy? It's called price gauging, by the way, price gauging. Uh, she is going to go, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=344.96s)]
*  she has no proof of anything. That's not a policy. And if she was, this is what you say. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=350.32s)]
*  First off, it's going to be, uh, price gauging. I'm going to be attacking that. Next, I'm going [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=354.8s)]
*  to be doing whatever she wants to do. I'm going to be taxing the rich, unrealized tax gains. You [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=358.32s)]
*  give her five straight things, give them five straight things you're going to do. Instead, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=363.04s)]
*  it's two minutes to price gauging. Tell me what price gauging is. This, I was listening to this [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  last night. There's CNN cut in live. It was unlistenable. Yes. And I thought, let me just [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  look at the VEDA tomorrow and I'll see what's going to be on the show and for radio. I'm [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=376.24s)]
*  looking at it. There's nothing in this. I can't put, we can't put our people through listening [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=380.24s)]
*  to this. Well, you know, she did say to the, to the couple from Pennsylvania, she did say [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  what her plan was. It was to bring down prices. Problem is she didn't explain how that's going to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=390.08s)]
*  impact people. Okay. Price gauging, how's that going to work? How, how are all those things going [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=395.68s)]
*  to work? And we have been telling you from the get-go, the whole idea is she does not want to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=400.16s)]
*  make news because when she makes news, she's got to explain stuff. At one point she said, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=406.48s)]
*  Oprah said, I didn't realize you had a gun. And she said, absolutely. I've got a gun. And if somebody [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  comes in the house, I'm going to, I'm, they're going to get shot. And then Kamala Harris said, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=415.44s)]
*  you know what? My staff is probably going to have to clean that up because she realized [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=419.6s)]
*  she was being honest. She was being blunt. She was telling the truth. She was pretending to be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  blunt and honest. I like to know that gun. If Oprah has endorsed Kamala Harris and she's on her side [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  and she didn't know that she had a gun, she's on her side. How, how the hell is American people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=432.56s)]
*  supposed to know that she had a gun? All of a sudden she just got all these, she's, she's been [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  attorney general, US Senator, district attorney, and no one knew she owned a gun until now. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=442.56s)]
*  Well, and that's to the point that I'm about to make. And that is what, when she gives these very [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  broad, very vague answers and it's part of their strategy, but it flies in the face of those polls [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=454.56s)]
*  that we have been talking about for a week. And that is a plurality of people, of voters, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=460.8s)]
*  want to know more about her. They want to know more about what she's going to do. And so what [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=466.88s)]
*  they did, they brought all those Hollywood stars in hundreds of thousands of people watched the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=471.04s)]
*  live stream today. Millions and millions of people are going to see little clips. Okay. Here's Chris [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=475.36s)]
*  rock. Here's Meryl Streep. Here's all these people. They love her. And for a lot of people, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=480.88s)]
*  that's all they need. I think she's trying to be more of a Republican. She's stealing a lot of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=486.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's policies by saying no tax on tips after he said it. Now she's saying no more fracking. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  Now she's saying we like the wall. Now she's saying we're going to close the border. And then [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=500.48s)]
*  she said, if someone breaks into my home, you're going to get shot. Those are, you know, after she [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=506.72s)]
*  said mandatory buyback for your guns, I'm going to, I'm going to make that a mandatory buyback [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=511.28s)]
*  program. And then she walked that back. I think she's trying to sound more like a Republican. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=516.24s)]
*  If a Republican said someone walks in my house, they're going to get shot. Even though a lot of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=520.8s)]
*  people have guns to protect their family. I think that the left would have run with that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=524.48s)]
*  I would love to know what kind of gun is it? How often you've been trained with it. What made [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=528.08s)]
*  you buy the gun? Who got it for you? And what do we feel? Yeah. Do you have a permit? Tell me about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=532.0s)]
*  the process. What about the process? Do you think you can make better? Oh, background check. You [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=537.28s)]
*  got a background check. Didn't you? I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ViWWJ8rcU&t=541.04s)]
