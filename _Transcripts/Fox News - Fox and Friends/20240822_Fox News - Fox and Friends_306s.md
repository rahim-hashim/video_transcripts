# Conway: The Democrats will say anything
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A)
*  When Republicans use the word freedom, they mean that the government should be free to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=0.0s)]
*  invade your doctor's office. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=8.08s)]
*  They'll repeal the Affordable Care Act. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=10.0s)]
*  They'll gut Social Security and Medicare. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=13.64s)]
*  And they will ban abortion across this country, with or without Congress. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=18.36s)]
*  Yeah, the problem is none of that's true. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=21.72s)]
*  VP Kennedy Tim Walz using last night's DNC to target Donald Trump moments ago. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=23.76s)]
*  Trump firing back. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=28.92s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  Every one of those things is a lie. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  Abortion, I will bring it up. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=34.32s)]
*  They wanted to get rid of Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=36.96s)]
*  They wanted to bring that subject back to the states. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Every Democrat wanted that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  Every Republican, every liberal, every conservative, and every legal scholar. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=44.92s)]
*  And I did it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=49.44s)]
*  And it's now back in the state where it belongs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=50.44s)]
*  They say in the—I want a federal ban. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=52.56s)]
*  I would never—they know I've said it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  There will not be a federal ban. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=57.88s)]
*  And he's not getting rid of Medicare or Social Security. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Fox News contributed former Trump White House senior counsel Kellyanne Conway to respond. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=63.24s)]
*  So that's what they've been saying. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=68.64s)]
*  It's been very frustrating for the former president listening to that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  Can you blame him, Kellyanne? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=72.88000000000001s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=73.88s)]
*  And remember, everybody it takes to the podium here in Chicago, Brian, is not under oath. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=75.48s)]
*  They literally will say anything. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  And they have been. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=82.2s)]
*  Not only are they lying about Project 2025 and throwing it into a script here and there, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=83.44s)]
*  they have an entire graphic for it behind the speakers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  And it is a big lie. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=92.76s)]
*  They want to scare people, you know, for all this nonsense talk about joy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=94.48s)]
*  Look, on abortion, I think President Trump has done very well, because what he's done [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  is he's reflected consensus. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=101.72s)]
*  He's, I think, showed a little bit of concession and a lot of compassion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=103.68s)]
*  How? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=108.4s)]
*  Like the other six Republican presidents that we've had since 1973, Roe vs. Wade, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=109.4s)]
*  says, I'm pro-life with three exceptions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=115.04s)]
*  Rape incest life for the mother. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=116.92s)]
*  He took it a step farther after Dobs. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  He said, I'm going to put it back to the states. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  A lot of the states have acted. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=121.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris's state of California could basically abortion anyone at any time, anywhere, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=123.04s)]
*  anyhow. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=127.44s)]
*  Tim Walz made it that way in Minnesota. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=128.44s)]
*  Brian, that is not reflecting consensus for the people of California and Minnesota. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=129.8s)]
*  There was a little girl named Ileana, born at 25 weeks or so in California. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=134.44s)]
*  She weighed 12 ounces. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=139.16s)]
*  That's a diet Coke can. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=140.52s)]
*  She's home. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=142.56s)]
*  She's surviving and thriving. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=143.56s)]
*  And I think if we can talk a little bit about those examples as well and have a science [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=144.88s)]
*  and medicine conversation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=148.96s)]
*  Also, J.D. Vance, he's great on abortion. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=150.32s)]
*  He talks about all those young women where he grew up who never knew they had another [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=153.32s)]
*  choice other than to get an abortion, who were told you're not good enough or rich enough [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=156.96s)]
*  or smart enough to be a mother. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=160.84s)]
*  So there's all kinds of choices that people should be extended to women who are afraid. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=163.44s)]
*  This is a pro-life party. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=168.36s)]
*  President Trump has threaded a needle. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=170.36s)]
*  And they're also lying about the Affordable Care Act. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump did away with the mandate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=174.36s)]
*  And that was upheld by the Fifth Circuit and it went to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=178.24s)]
*  So they're just lying about that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=181.8s)]
*  But let me say something. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  Fourteen years after Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act passed, and the big lie, keep your [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=184.36s)]
*  plan, keep your doctorate, even bigger lie, every American would have health insurance. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=189.88s)]
*  Fourteen years after Obamacare passed, over 28 million Americans have no health insurance. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=194.28s)]
*  There's a fact for you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=199.28s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=200.28s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=201.28s)]
*  Real quick, RFK, if he does endorse the dropout and do endorse Trump, what changes? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=202.28s)]
*  Well, his voters will go with him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=207.28s)]
*  And he should make that very clear to his voters. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=210.04s)]
*  This is not about a cabinet position or being up at the podium with President Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=211.92s)]
*  This is about telling his voters, he's our guy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=216.76s)]
*  The Trump-Vance ticket is our ticket. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=220.04s)]
*  We've got to stop Kamala Harris and Tim Walz because A, we don't know what they stand for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=222.08s)]
*  and B, what we do know when they do actually finish their sentences, that's when they're [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  really scary and menacing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=231.44s)]
*  So I think it's great for President Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=233.74s)]
*  I think if they go to Arizona tomorrow, they should both talk about school choice, they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=235.72000000000003s)]
*  should talk about the economy, the border. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=238.84s)]
*  I think they agree on many aspects of that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=241.0s)]
*  We've got 40 seconds, real quick. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=243.28s)]
*  The theme of this, make Trump the incumbent and make them the breath of fresh air? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=245.56s)]
*  Insurgent, absolutely. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  That's what I got out of this week, Brian. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=252.64s)]
*  I realized yesterday as I was sitting here for primetime coverage, they're running her [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  leg. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=258.4s)]
*  She's the insurgent, fresh face. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=259.4s)]
*  She's never been in Washington. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=260.4s)]
*  She's Bill Clinton, 1992. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=262.36s)]
*  She's Barack Obama, 2008. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=264.36s)]
*  No, she's not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=265.8s)]
*  She's there now. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  This is the Harris administration. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump is not the incumbent. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=269.84s)]
*  He has an incumbent's record, but he's the insurgent. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  He's the changemaker here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  And we have to make sure that that message seeps through. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=275.56s)]
*  And by the way, this message seeping through, your Fox Nation show, Here's the Deal with [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=278.68s)]
*  Kellyanne drops every Thursday on Fox Nation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=282.36s)]

*  Kellyanne, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3B7G2E26A&t=286.48s)]
