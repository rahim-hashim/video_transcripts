*  But you did say to me though, your favorite memory, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=0.0s)]
*  you think the most impactful memory, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=2.86s)]
*  didn't happen in the game. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=4.14s)]
*  So tell me what you think. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=5.64s)]
*  You look back on all of your time at the Super Bowl, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=7.26s)]
*  what still, I don't know if it gives you goosebumps. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=9.1s)]
*  Oh it does. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=11.86s)]
*  It does? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  It does. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=13.52s)]
*  And every time I hear it I get goosebumps. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=14.36s)]
*  In fact, talking about it right now I can feel it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=15.26s)]
*  Whitney Houston. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  It was right after Desert Storm. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=18.78s)]
*  It was the Giants in Buffalo, 1991, they played in Tampa. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=21.28s)]
*  She gave a rendition of the national anthem [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=24.48s)]
*  and the Jets flew over. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=27.28s)]
*  And it was just a really unique time in our country [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  and it was just the best feeling ever. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=32.3s)]
*  You felt great about football, great about your family, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  great about our country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=39.76s)]
*  And to hear her sing that and to hear it even now, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=41.26s)]
*  it was just special. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  It's just something that is so memorable, it's indelible. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=46.72s)]
*  Every list, Jim has it as number one. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=49.8s)]
*  Number one rendition of the national anthem. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=51.94s)]
*  And by the way. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=54.36s)]
*  Some of our best moments, can I interrupt you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=55.2s)]
*  Some of our best moments in sports [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  aren't actually what happens on the field. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=58.06s)]
*  George Bush throwing out the first pitch after 9-11. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=60.06s)]
*  We're gonna play baseball. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=62.86s)]
*  We're gonna have a sense of normalcy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=64.06s)]
*  We're gonna grieve 9-11, that was one. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=65.36s)]
*  Another one was Muhammad Ali lighting the torch in Atlanta. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=67.5s)]
*  That moment for humanity. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=70.74s)]
*  That was the greatest of all time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=72.38s)]
*  Taking the light from Janet Evans and with Parkinson's. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=74.12s)]
*  And so those are the great moments [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=77.14s)]
*  that you'd never ever forget. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  And that had nothing to do with what went on on the field. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=79.94s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395S9w3YZfg&t=83.02s)]
