*  of the Senate Intelligence Committee and they're going to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=26.0s)]
*  talk about the issues that she's had in the past from you know [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=28.0s)]
*  the way that she views some foreign dictators to the use of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=31.0s)]
*  Intel weapons and tools for surveillance so she's going to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=34.0s)]
*  have a lot of in-depth questions and a bit of an uphill battle [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=37.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=40.0s)]
*  What about that you know we're going to kick things off on [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=42.0s)]
*  Wednesday there are some other hearings going on like Howard [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=44.0s)]
*  Lutnick and what not but all the focus on Wednesday really is [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=47.0s)]
*  going to be on Kennedy because health and human services is an [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=50.0s)]
*  absolute mess and a disaster but he's taken some positions that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=55.0s)]
*  I think some people are going to question but boy President Trump [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=60.0s)]
*  is adamant that he get in there and I think he talks a lot of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=64.0s)]
*  common sense yeah and maybe he will I mean he's really connected [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=67.0s)]
*  with a lot of American people talking about the health and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=71.0s)]
*  safety of our food and of our young people and what people are [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=74.0s)]
*  being exposed to and I think that really has connected with a lot [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=77.0s)]
*  of people who have those same concerns it's interesting because [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=80.0s)]
*  he's got some support we think from Democrats and Republicans but [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=83.0s)]
*  he's also got critiques from Democrats and Republicans the left [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=86.0s)]
*  doesn't like some of what he's had to say about some of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=90.0s)]
*  vaccines the right is worried about his position on abortion so [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=93.0s)]
*  he's going to have to answer concerns from both sides when he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=97.0s)]
*  takes that chair on Wednesday or Thursday yeah that's such a that's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=100.0s)]
*  such a great and interesting point Shannon that you know the the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=103.0s)]
*  the maja movement the make America healthy again I think has a lot [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=107.0s)]
*  of bipartisan support it's such an interesting pick because as you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=110.0s)]
*  say he is pro-choice we had on someone earlier today a guy named [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=113.0s)]
*  Kevin begata from real alternatives and HHS could you know end [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=116.0s)]
*  Planned Parenthood's funding right the government could end [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=119.0s)]
*  Planned Parenthood's funding I'm sorry the Congress could and HHS [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=122.0s)]
*  could then fund help for women who are facing you know unplanned [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=125.0s)]
*  pregnancies I mean that's something that could he could end [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=128.0s)]
*  Planned Parenthood's funding right the government could end [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=131.0s)]
*  Planned Parenthood's funding I'm sorry the Congress could and HHS [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=134.0s)]
*  could then fund help for women who are facing you know unplanned [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=137.0s)]
*  pregnancies I mean that's something that could he could actually do [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=140.0s)]
*  something really substantive and pro-life and still maintain his [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=143.0s)]
*  position yeah I mean think about our federal agencies like HHS it's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=147.0s)]
*  huge it covers and touches so many things in our lives and they've [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=150.0s)]
*  got tons of regulatory power some critics will say Congress has [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=153.0s)]
*  advocated too much of that in this administrative state now can make [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=156.0s)]
*  all of these rules but it does give HHS a lot of freedom when it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=159.0s)]
*  comes to promulgating these regulations and making decisions [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=162.0s)]
*  about where money flows and all kinds of things so he's going to have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=165.0s)]
*  a lot of power on that front if he becomes secretary yeah obviously [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=168.0s)]
*  President Trump is wasting no time sort of pushing through his entire [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=171.0s)]
*  agenda including his effort to end birthright citizenship a judge has [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=174.0s)]
*  put a temporary hold on that decision where do you see that going from [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=177.0s)]
*  here well I don't think that the Trump team is surprised by that at all [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=180.0s)]
*  they knew this would immediately go to court there are actually multiple [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=183.0s)]
*  lawsuits over the birthright issue and I think that's a good thing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=186.0s)]
*  because I think that's a good thing because I think that's a good thing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=189.0s)]
*  it could end up all the way at the Supreme Court because listen the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=193.0s)]
*  fourteenth amendment been around for a long time a lot of people site [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=196.0s)]
*  back to this eighteen ninety eight Supreme Court decision which is not [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=199.0s)]
*  an exact parallel to now so there's been a lot of jurisprudence [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=202.0s)]
*  and and changes in our border and immigration all of these things [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=205.0s)]
*  over time so would the justices get to a different interpretation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=208.0s)]
*  than what most people have seen as the wording of the fourteenth [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=211.0s)]
*  amendment what it means over the last you know century plus [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=214.0s)]
*  and we're going to be talking about this in a little bit but I think [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=217.0s)]
*  it means over the last you know century plus I don't know [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=220.0s)]
*  but it appears that this administration is aimed at getting it there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=223.0s)]
*  so they can answer and listen the answer may be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=226.0s)]
*  you got to amend the Constitution which as we know from schoolhouse rock [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=229.0s)]
*  is a very heavy lift and it's not often done [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=232.0s)]
*  but that might be the answer they get let's bring back schoolhouse rock [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=235.0s)]
*  more people watch I learned a lot from that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=238.0s)]
*  there are cases to be made to say no it doesn't need [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=241.0s)]
*  a an amendment in order to do that people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=244.0s)]
*  you know good people like a senator Mike Lee knows the Constitution [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Lo3qjQ1sU&t=247.0s)]
