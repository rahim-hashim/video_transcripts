# WORSE THAN A WARZONE: Jewish students fear safety amid rising antisemitism
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI)
*  So today, Jewish students at UMass Amherst on edge after a fellow student is arrested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=0.0s)]
*  for assaulting a Jew on campus. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=12.48s)]
*  The school confirmed the incident saying, quote, an individual approached participants [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=14.8s)]
*  and made aggressive and rude gestures. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=19.44s)]
*  Later this person assaulted a student who was holding an Israeli flag and proceeded [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=22.68s)]
*  to steal and spit on the flag. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=27.1s)]
*  The soaring anti-Semitism on campuses forcing one Jewish New Jersey high school to take [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=29.84s)]
*  action. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=35.0s)]
*  One in college just quote, before college representatives can enter our building, they [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=36.0s)]
*  must bring a statement from their university leadership that detailing their plan to protect [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=40.08s)]
*  and maintain the safety and security of our graduates on their campuses as Jews. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=45.68s)]
*  They were live at that high school, to our Academy of Bergen County with a panel of students, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=50.84s)]
*  parents and administrators. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=56.28s)]
*  Thank you all so much for joining me this morning. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=58.24s)]
*  Rabbi Sholomo, let's go to that statement. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=60.32s)]
*  What provoked you to release that statement? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=63.58s)]
*  Well, thank you for having us, Lawrence. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=66.72s)]
*  What provoked us is that rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=69.8s)]
*  And we think of ourselves as educators and we really needed to educate our parent body [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  and our students about what was happening, those trends. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=78.32s)]
*  They hate speech and we also needed to communicate to our parents and to our students how we [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=82.64s)]
*  felt about it, our stand, taking a very strong activist stand and communicating to universities [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  and directly how strongly we felt about their need to control the violence and the hate [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=93.32s)]
*  speech on our campuses. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=99.08s)]
*  Naomi, your parent, when you see the protests at these college campuses, I've interviewed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  a lot of these students and they say that the video coming from Israel is propaganda. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=108.32s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  The kids weren't beheaded. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  What runs through your mind as you prepare to send one of your children off? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=116.72s)]
*  I think that as parents, we need to teach our children. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=122.32s)]
*  We need to teach our children before they go off to campus. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=127.32s)]
*  We've taught our children how to be proud Jews and proud Americans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=131.16s)]
*  And that's something that we want, that identity that we've given them, that's something that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=135.04s)]
*  we want them to be proud of and be able to live with and be safe on campuses. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  And I think that we need to, when we teach our children how to advocate, we need to explain [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=144.6s)]
*  to them the difference between free speech that this great country allows us to have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=150.64s)]
*  and hate speech. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=156.06s)]
*  And you can never, not my children, not any child, can never feel threatened or should [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=157.56s)]
*  never feel threatened or intimidated because of the beliefs that they have or the opinions [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  they express. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=170.6s)]
*  That's not okay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  That's not okay. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=173.48s)]
*  So true. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=174.72s)]
*  Micah, how do you feel as a Jewish student preparing to go to college? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=175.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm on student council and what I've been gathering from the students is that traditionally [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=180.28s)]
*  a high percentage of our schools, so they go to Israel to spend the year studying abroad [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=186.04s)]
*  for a year after high school. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=190.76s)]
*  And before they go off to college. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=192.84s)]
*  And the rhetoric I've been receiving, I have a good friend who's currently in Israel right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=194.8s)]
*  now and I asked him, are you afraid to be living in a war zone? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=198.76s)]
*  And he said, I'm more afraid to go to university next year than I am to be living in a war [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=202.36s)]
*  zone, which I think is a testament how brave Israel and the people who live there are, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=206.76s)]
*  but also sad for our country that our universities make people feel more unsafe and unwelcome [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=211.76s)]
*  than a war zone. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=217.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, that's pretty diabolical that these kids feel this way. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Karen, you're responsible for the college program and getting these kids off. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  Is this new? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=230.48s)]
*  I don't think we've seen anything like this at this level. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  I think anti-Semitism has always existed, but the rampant protests, the hateful, insightful, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  dangerous speech that I think is new. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=245.8s)]
*  And when I guide students, I think that it's important to educate like Rabbi Stotel was [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  saying, and I think that parents and students now are keeping themselves well apprised of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=259.18s)]
*  But also, I think that people are optimistic, meaning I think that now we are trying to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=260.92s)]
*  address it head on. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=268.38s)]
*  I think that they're optimistic that after spending a year in Israel, things will be [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=272.0s)]
*  different. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=276.08s)]
*  It happens to be that most of our early decision, early action candidates have stuck with their [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=277.08s)]
*  first choice school. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=282.2s)]
*  So that to me is a positive part of that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=283.96s)]
*  But obviously, my most important feeling right now is concern for the safety of our students [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  who are currently on campus. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just on campus. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  It's happening all across the country when you have the FBI directors say that 60 percent [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=298.64s)]
*  of the hate crimes in this country are against Jews. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=302.44s)]
*  It's an epidemic. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=306.68s)]
*  And that's why we're here today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=307.68s)]
*  We're going to be talking with folks all morning, a panel of young people as well as administrators. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=308.68s)]
*  So y'all stay right here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=315.64s)]
*  We'll bring you later on the show. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuXoIO3jcaI&t=316.64s)]
