# ‘Hollywood is more awake’: Dean Cain on Trump naming Stallone, Gibson, Voight ambassadors
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw)
*  So is Donald Trump about to make Hollywood great again? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=0.0s)]
*  The President-elect announcing actors John Voight, Mel Gibson, and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=3.36s)]
*  Sly Stallone will be special ambassadors to Hollywood. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=6.88s)]
*  Actor Dean Cain joins us now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Great to see you, Dean. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=15.0s)]
*  So are we gonna make Hollywood great again? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Let's hope so. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=20.0s)]
*  First, I just wanna say congratulations to my big brother, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=20.64s)]
*  Will Cain, on his new show. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=22.84s)]
*  Even though I'm many years older than he is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=24.6s)]
*  But look, Charlie, you got Mel Gibson, John Voight, Sylvester Stallone, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=27.72s)]
*  all huge Hollywood legends. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=31.0s)]
*  All folks who have survived numerous cancellation attempts, and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=33.08s)]
*  shockingly, all a little bit conservative. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=36.68s)]
*  It's a huge departure from the recent years of the Obamas on the board of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=39.16s)]
*  directors for Netflix and things like that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=43.32s)]
*  But Andrew Breitbart once famously said, politics is downstream from culture. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  And he's right, cuz liberals have been in control of Hollywood for a long, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=50.64s)]
*  long time, and the studios also controlled by liberals. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  So Disney changing every known beloved character into some woke version of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  the original. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=63.4s)]
*  So obviously what we see on TV and on the screens and so on and so forth, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=64.16s)]
*  can have a huge impact on how we feel about certain issues, situations. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=67.6s)]
*  And you look at the successful films lately, Top Gun Maverick, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Sound of Freedom, the number one late night television show, Gutfeld. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=75.08s)]
*  So people have been voting with their pocketbooks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=79.08s)]
*  It's wonderful. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=81.4s)]
*  I love to see these guys in there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=82.36s)]
*  Things are changing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=84.08s)]
*  And it's wonderful to see these guys sort of, I don't know, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=85.96s)]
*  celebrate it as opposed to cancel it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=89.8s)]
*  Yeah, now I love that you mentioned that quote from Andrew Breitbart, and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=91.72s)]
*  I think it's so important and so true. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=94.8s)]
*  And I think it's really a big reason why the left goes so [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=97.24s)]
*  crazy about Donald Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=101.08s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is not downstream from culture. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=102.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is culture. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=105.6s)]
*  And I think that that's why they freak out so much about him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=107.36s)]
*  And it's why he has been so successful. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=110.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, they've controlled culture, so to speak, for so long. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  I think they got complacent and they started to get out over their [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=117.96s)]
*  skis a little bit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=121.44s)]
*  Some of these shows are just slap in the face and audiences have been rejecting him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=122.64s)]
*  So I think it's wonderful. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=127.32s)]
*  I'm looking forward to an absolutely incredible four years coming up and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=128.64s)]
*  beyond. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=133.0s)]
*  I feel like there's sanity back in the United States of America. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=133.8s)]
*  And I couldn't be more excited. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Great choice by President Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=139.32s)]
*  All great guys, all great actors. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  And they'll be the President's eyes and ears in Hollywood. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=143.92s)]
*  Wow, what a concept. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you find that in Hollywood these days that there is a different sort of, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=149.32s)]
*  I feel like the reaction to President Trump's election victory this time, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  like here in New York, it was different. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Do you find that there's sort of a different wind around Hollywood today? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=162.56s)]
*  Yeah, people are talking openly. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=168.72s)]
*  I've been doing it for years, but I've been like one of five people talking like [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=171.08s)]
*  this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=174.28s)]
*  And now suddenly everybody is like, well, because it couldn't be any worse than [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=174.96s)]
*  the last four years, to be honest. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=178.96s)]
*  And what's been going on with an absentee president and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=180.28s)]
*  who knows who's really been running the country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=184.84s)]
*  It's clear right now who's running the country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=186.8s)]
*  Everybody knows it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=189.04s)]
*  They're like, you know what, I made a mistake the first time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=189.88s)]
*  Let's bring Donald Trump back in and then see if we can't correct this thing and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=192.8s)]
*  I can pay less for my groceries and wars across the world will stop. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=196.08s)]
*  And it goes on and on and on, my friend, but people are talking about it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=200.44s)]
*  Hollywood is a lot more awake now and I'm very happy about it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=203.88s)]
*  Well, maybe you've pinpointed the one accomplishment of Joe Biden. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=208.28s)]
*  He made everybody realize how much we appreciate Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=211.96s)]
*  Thank you, Dean Cain. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOFOV1X05Lw&t=215.44s)]
