# Hannity: This could be Kamala Harris' downfall
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs)
*  All right, meanwhile, let's bring in Sean Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=0.0s)]
*  Sean, great to see you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=2.12s)]
*  Dressed casual, great to see you in New York. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Were you truly home? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=5.12s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if you moved back here soon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=6.12s)]
*  I would. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  I would. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=8.92s)]
*  I wouldn't count on that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=9.72s)]
*  You clearly don't watch a show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=11.08s)]
*  What is your take on the state of the race right now? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=13.48s)]
*  Everyone's got their opinion. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=15.4s)]
*  I want yours. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=16.56s)]
*  Look, let's start out with where we are with early voting. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=17.68s)]
*  Going into tomorrow, we've got to keep this in mind. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=21.88s)]
*  Everyone at home, please keep this in mind. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=24.6s)]
*  We have 80 to 90 million more Americans [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=26.62s)]
*  that will vote tomorrow. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=29.02s)]
*  That's a lot of votes that have yet to be cast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=30.78s)]
*  Going in, Kamala Harris has a math problem. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=33.5s)]
*  And that is that they way underperformed, especially [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=36.22s)]
*  in the swing states, in terms of what their target numbers [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  needed to be to go in with the lead that they wanted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=42.62s)]
*  And they just didn't get there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=46.46s)]
*  And they're way off. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=48.3s)]
*  They're off by double digits based on all the numbers [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=49.22s)]
*  I've been studying and seeing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=51.7s)]
*  And we all go over. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=52.94s)]
*  So what she now has to do is something [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=54.66s)]
*  the Democratic Party has never really pulled off before. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=58.16s)]
*  That's her challenge. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=60.36s)]
*  And that is to get people to the polls day out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=61.63999999999999s)]
*  Do I think that Ricky Martin, Lady Gaga, and JLo, Willie [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=64.56s)]
*  Nelson, Oprah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=69.24s)]
*  Yeah, are going to put it on top. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=69.74s)]
*  I don't really think so. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=72.1s)]
*  I think the days of Hollywood celebrities influencing people [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=73.52s)]
*  are long gone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=78.0s)]
*  And however, what I am telling people is if you, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=79.44s)]
*  and I'll say this as loudly as I can, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=84.12s)]
*  if you live in Georgia, North Carolina, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=86.56s)]
*  if you're in Pennsylvania, if you're in Wisconsin, Michigan, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=89.0s)]
*  if you're in Arizona, Nevada, just [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=91.96s)]
*  assume that your one vote will be the determining [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  vote in this election. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=96.88s)]
*  The polls are that tight. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  And I'm following it closely. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  And however, I mean, I can argue both sides of this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=103.56s)]
*  We're supposed to have a red wave in 2020, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=107.16s)]
*  That didn't materialize. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  Where everyone wants to analyze it, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  but there's really only one poll that matters. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=112.8s)]
*  And that's tomorrow. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=115.16s)]
*  And when you have 80 to 90 million more people, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=116.64s)]
*  that's a lot of people have to vote. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=119.2s)]
*  What do you say to the person that hasn't voted yet, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=120.72s)]
*  got a text message yesterday from someone [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  that said the pastor of their church, she talked to the wife. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=126.0s)]
*  And the wife said, I just can't vote for Donald Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=130.44s)]
*  What do you say to that pastor's wife? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=133.24s)]
*  One of the problems Kamala's had this whole campaign [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=135.72s)]
*  is she can't be who she really is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=138.44s)]
*  Are they really going to run on this idea [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=141.36s)]
*  that the manly man is Tim Walz, who [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  wants to put feminine hygiene products in boys' bathrooms [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=147.72000000000003s)]
*  in school, that can't load his own shotgun? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=150.72000000000003s)]
*  That's kind of a tough sell. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  That's their sell to men. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  What they're selling to women, and this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  is what Kamala's trying to do too, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=159.24s)]
*  she's trying to get a path to the White House [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  based on a lot of lies. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=163.52s)]
*  She's saying Donald Trump will have a national abortion ban. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  False. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  She's saying that he will limit access to contraception. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=168.88s)]
*  False. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=171.84s)]
*  That he doesn't support IVF. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=172.64s)]
*  False. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=175.16s)]
*  So he's lying to women. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=175.68s)]
*  Every single demographic, if you look [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=178.32s)]
*  at the numbers the first three years of the Trump [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=181.04s)]
*  administration, the people that prospered in record numbers, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=183.32s)]
*  not seen in 60 years, were African-Americans, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=186.6s)]
*  Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=189.44s)]
*  women in the workplace, African-American youth [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=191.96s)]
*  unemployment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=194.56s)]
*  So for her message, she's trying to say [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=195.6s)]
*  she's pro-gun, she's trying to, she [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=198.76s)]
*  can't run away from her fracking position, which she said [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=201.64s)]
*  she would put a ban on, or offshore drilling. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=205.28s)]
*  She co-sponsored the Green New Deal with Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  $93 trillion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=211.76s)]
*  Nobody really has asked her about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=213.44s)]
*  Has she really changed her mind? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=216.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=217.44s)]
*  Is she really going to run on a position [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=218.48s)]
*  that I'm going to be tough on the borders now [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=220.28s)]
*  after she supports decriminalizing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=222.44s)]
*  illegal immigration, free food, housing, health care, education? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=228.72s)]
*  Sex change operations, which is fine, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=229.2s)]
*  as long as the taxpayers don't have to pay for it, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  And a path to citizenship amnesty. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=234.12s)]
*  You can go down the whole list, and it really [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=236.76s)]
*  is a binary choice. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=239.64s)]
*  The two candidates could not be more different. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=241.32s)]
*  But Sean, I think it comes down to something [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=243.44s)]
*  that you've been talking about, we've [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=245.28s)]
*  been talking about for four years. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=246.78s)]
*  And that is, since COVID, everything costs more. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=248.76s)]
*  And during the Biden administration, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=252.44s)]
*  things did not go down. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=253.92s)]
*  And Nikki Haley writes about it in the op-ed where she's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=255.2s)]
*  supports Donald Trump, says vote for Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  Easy choice. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  She says, the average family spends $13,000 more [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  in annual costs for their family. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=267.28s)]
*  Unless you've got a $13,000 raise over four years, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=270.76s)]
*  you're $13,000 in the hole. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=274.12s)]
*  I mean, this is the bottom line. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=275.84s)]
*  And I keep going back to the simple, basic question. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  There's two things that drive elections, peace and prosperity. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=280.84s)]
*  And then you ask the question, the infamous Reagan question, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=287.44s)]
*  OK, is your border more safe and secure? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  We know the answer. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=291.84s)]
*  Are you more safe and secure in your small town or big city? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=298.88s)]
*  Are you paying more for every item you buy [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  in every store you go to? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=302.88s)]
*  Do you like paying $1.50 more for gasoline? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  Brian does, but everybody else does. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=305.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=307.52s)]
*  Besides that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=308.02s)]
*  So let's talk about what Harris had a chance to do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  Prop 36 over in California, they're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=310.67999999999995s)]
*  redoing their criminal justice. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=312.56s)]
*  They're revisiting it to actually put felons in jail. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=314.32s)]
*  And get tough. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=316.52s)]
*  And get tough up and down the measure. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=317.24s)]
*  She voted. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=318.68s)]
*  So here's what she said. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  This is an opportunity, I think, for a candidate to show, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=321.08s)]
*  I am tough on crime despite my track record. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Listen to what she said. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=325.96s)]
*  Have you returned the ballot to California? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=327.88s)]
*  And how did you vote on Prop 36? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=329.84s)]
*  So I have my ballot is on its way to California. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  And I'm going to trust the system [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  that it will arrive there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=338.2s)]
*  And I am not going to talk about the vote on that, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=340.52s)]
*  because honestly, it's the Sunday before the election. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=343.56s)]
*  And I don't intend to create an endorsement one way [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=346.64s)]
*  or another around it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=350.4s)]
*  Axios called her the no comment candidate. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=352.36s)]
*  What do you take on that? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=355.52s)]
*  She has a chance to show she's tough on crime. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=357.0s)]
*  Look what I voted for. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=358.96s)]
*  Again, this goes back to the problem. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=360.96s)]
*  Every position she'd ever taken, mandatory gun confiscation, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=362.8s)]
*  her position on the border, her support of a bail fund [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=367.12s)]
*  four days after a police precinct is burned to the ground, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=370.92s)]
*  and saying on CBS, the rioters won't stop, shouldn't stop, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  and we're not going to stop supporting them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=378.04s)]
*  Every position from the Green New Deal, elimination [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=380.2s)]
*  of private health care, no fracking, ban on offshore [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=382.8s)]
*  drilling, not securing the borders, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=387.24s)]
*  it's a medieval vanity project. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=389.6s)]
*  She can't be who she is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=392.16s)]
*  She's not authentic. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=393.24s)]
*  She has an answer. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=394.6s)]
*  She voted a certain way. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=395.8s)]
*  Tell the American people, why won't you [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=397.36s)]
*  be honest with the American people? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=399.44s)]
*  This likely will be her downfall. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=401.52s)]
*  I would argue that she can expose who she really is, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=404.6s)]
*  because if she does, the American people would reject it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=407.96s)]
*  as extreme and radical, which I believe she is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=411.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=414.08s)]
*  Either if she announced how she voted, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=414.88s)]
*  she's either a flip-flopper or she's so radical and extreme, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=417.08s)]
*  which is probably the one. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=419.92s)]
*  I picked the latter. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=420.84s)]
*  Sean, tonight at 9 o'clock, he's not [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=421.96s)]
*  going to be guaranteed to wear that outfit. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=423.72s)]
*  I don't even know if he's wearing a tie. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=425.28s)]
*  It's a Ralph Lauren. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=426.48s)]
*  Very fancy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=428.32s)]
*  No, I'm just saying, we just had a great still picture of you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=429.12s)]
*  taken by a professional photographer. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=431.52s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=433.36s)]
*  Bill Hemmer. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=433.88s)]
*  Thanks so much, Sean. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=434.56s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=435.4s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QnPfSNUgcs&t=436.4s)]
