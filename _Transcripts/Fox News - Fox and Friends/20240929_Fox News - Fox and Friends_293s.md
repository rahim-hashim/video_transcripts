# Alcohol consumption linked to 6 type of cancers, study says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY)
*  Well, this morning a new study warning drinking alcohol can be linked to six different types [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=0.0s)]
*  of cancer. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=7.0s)]
*  The research going on to add cutting back or eliminating alcohol can lower the risk [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=8.36s)]
*  of these cancers by almost 10%. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Here to react is Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Sapphire. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Nicole, always great to have you especially in studio. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=19.52s)]
*  So this is not something that I thought would be an effect. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=23.0s)]
*  I mean, I know there's a lot of negative effects from drinking alcohol, especially if it's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=26.44s)]
*  excessive, but cancer, who knew? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=29.76s)]
*  Oh, goodness, I mean, just look at that list right there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=32.04s)]
*  Cancer essentially is a toxin that can wreak havoc on just about anything that it touches. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=34.6s)]
*  So from oral cancers, throat cancers, esophageal cancers, makes it way down to the stomach, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=38.88s)]
*  stomach cancers, your liver and your pancreas, metabolize the alcohol, which also has a rise [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=43.72s)]
*  in cancer, as well as colorectal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=49.24s)]
*  But on top of that, alcohol actually increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers such [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  as breast cancers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=56.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=57.28s)]
*  Well-known fact that alcohol is linked to a rise in cancers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=58.6s)]
*  Now that being said, for me, that doesn't mean that I completely abstain from alcohol. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  I've always had the mantra, everything in moderation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=66.72s)]
*  But it's not just cancer that alcohol increases your risk of, it's lethargy, obesity, depression, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=69.4s)]
*  poor sleep. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=74.72s)]
*  So yeah, there's not a lot of great things when it comes to alcohol, certainly no health [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=75.72s)]
*  benefits. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=80.12s)]
*  People do like to say, well, there's some antioxidants in my red wine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=81.12s)]
*  Okay, that may be true, but you know what? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=83.92s)]
*  You can also have a handful of blueberries, some spinach, you can get some great antioxidants [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=85.36s)]
*  there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=89.68s)]
*  It's also why there's a huge mocktail craze right now going on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=90.68s)]
*  People really are trying to cut back on alcohol. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=93.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think alcohol, I notice there's inflammation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=94.76s)]
*  You can almost see it in your face. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=97.96s)]
*  And inflammation is the beginning of cancers, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=99.12s)]
*  Absolutely, and autoimmune diseases. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Everything's on the rise. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=103.56s)]
*  I mean, you hear us talking about it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=104.56s)]
*  It's our consumption of all of these external things that are increasing our risk for illness. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=105.72s)]
*  Spinach, wine, I mean. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=110.24s)]
*  Everything in moderation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=112.28s)]
*  You're right, I totally agree with you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=114.36s)]
*  Here's another interesting topic. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=116.76s)]
*  Exercising at night, this study is saying it can actually lead to better sleep, which [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=119.92s)]
*  is something I never thought was true. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=124.32s)]
*  In fact, my excuse for not working out if it's later in the day is, oh, it'll affect [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=126.28s)]
*  my sleep. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=130.8s)]
*  I don't want to raise my heartbeat up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=131.8s)]
*  So what are the facts around this? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=133.92s)]
*  I can show you just as many studies that show exercise is better in the morning as it is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=135.92s)]
*  for at night. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=139.5s)]
*  The bottom line is, if you are motivated to exercise, do it anytime. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=140.66s)]
*  I don't care when you do it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=144.14s)]
*  I love that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=145.14s)]
*  Now, the health benefits for exercising early. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=146.14s)]
*  Anyone who watches me on social media knows that I am a morning workout person. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=147.66s)]
*  That's when I get it done. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=151.76s)]
*  Because for me, that endorphin boost, that rise in the heart rate, that gives me my motivation [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=153.06s)]
*  to the day. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=158.58s)]
*  And it's great for me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=159.58s)]
*  And I get that energy boost in the morning, and it carries me throughout the day. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=160.58s)]
*  Some people really just can't do that morning exercise. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=164.44s)]
*  And the truth is, your core temperature and your peak cardiovascular health really happens [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=167.38s)]
*  at 6 p.m. at night. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  So for people who are trying to build muscle and really get in those good workouts, evening [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=174.18s)]
*  workouts are really good for them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=178.4s)]
*  They also have that boost in endorphins. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=180.18s)]
*  And it actually can help you sleep at night, because endorphins, those are your feel-good [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  hormones. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=186.14s)]
*  They make you feel good. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=187.14s)]
*  Does it matter what exercise you're doing? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=188.14s)]
*  So you just mentioned weight training, which is something I would not have thought would [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=189.98s)]
*  have been great for nighttime, but you're saying it is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=193.2s)]
*  So what other exercises, or are there any that are not good to do? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=196.22s)]
*  So it's whatever, again, anything you're motivated to do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=200.18s)]
*  You obviously want to do some sort of cardiovascular, so whether it's running, swimming. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  I like the Peloton personally. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=207.58s)]
*  You also want to do some weight training, especially women. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  Light weights are going to help you decrease your osteoporosis risk. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=212.58s)]
*  So it's really important as you get into that perimenopause, postmenopause, that you are [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  doing some form of weight training. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=220.28s)]
*  You can't just hop on a bike. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=221.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  No excuses. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=224.82s)]
*  Really fast, so I'm curious about this one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=225.82s)]
*  Saunas. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=227.54s)]
*  If you get in a sauna later in the evening, is that bad? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=228.54s)]
*  It's going to raise your heart rate and not good for sleep? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=231.66s)]
*  So it is going to raise your heart rate. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=233.98s)]
*  It's also going to dehydrate you a little bit. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=235.42s)]
*  So you have to make sure that you hydrate, hydrate, hydrate after a sauna. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=237.06s)]
*  That might be difficult for people when they go to bed, because they may need to get up [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=240.54s)]
*  during the middle of the night. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=243.42s)]
*  So you have to be careful. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=244.42s)]
*  You don't want to not hydrate. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=245.42s)]
*  But it can also promote relaxation, and it's very good after an exercise. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=247.14s)]
*  So all of that will help you sleep. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=251.94s)]
*  I personally, I have a regimen of, you know, I turn off all of the electronics before [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=253.26s)]
*  beds. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=257.98s)]
*  I try to write down any notes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=258.98s)]
*  So if there's anything I'm trying to remember, so it's out of my mind. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=260.06s)]
*  That's a great tip. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  I relax, and then I take some liquid herbs to help me sleep as well. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  I like my melatonin too at night. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  Not melatonin, I mean magnesium. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=269.98s)]
*  I don't do melatonin, I do magnesium. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=270.98s)]
*  Melatonin, ashwagandha, there's a lot of different things. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=271.98s)]
*  You can see them all on my social media. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  I think you should put your sleep routine on your website, on your Twitter. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=276.74s)]
*  People will love it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VesUa9U5QTY&t=280.38s)]
