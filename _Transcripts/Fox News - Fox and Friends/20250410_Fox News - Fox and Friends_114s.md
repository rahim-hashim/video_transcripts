# BREAKING: Moscow releases Russian-American ballerina in prisoner swap
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirms that Moscow has freed a wrongfully detained Russian American ballerina. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=0.0s)]
*  Alex Hogan joins us from our London bureau with all the details. Hey Alex. Good morning Ainsley. So American Russian dual citizen Ksenia Karolina, who had been detained by Russia, is now free. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=12.0s)]
*  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the news this morning, writing on X quote, saying American Ksenia Karolina is on a plane back home to the United States. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=23.0s)]
*  She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release. POTUS will continue to work for the release of all Americans. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=32.0s)]
*  Karolina was arrested in January of 2024 in Yekaterinburg during a visit to see her family. She was jailed for donating about $50 to a charity supporting Ukraine on the first day of Russia's invasion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=41.0s)]
*  The court found her guilty of high treason, sentencing her to imprisonment in a penal colony. The amateur ballerina and Los Angeles resident became a US citizen in 2021. Her family and her loved ones have been vocal in their efforts demanding her release. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=54.0s)]
*  The Russian on the Russian side, they made it very difficult because they don't recognize Ksenia as American, which is absurd for me. But the US State Department said we're trying relentlessly. Every single day we are trying to get close to Ksenia. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=70.0s)]
*  She was freed in exchange for a German Russian dual national. Now this prisoner swap took place early this morning in the UAE. This is also the second US Russian prisoner swap to take place in less than two months. Lawrence, back to you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avytfhP4SQw&t=85.0s)]
