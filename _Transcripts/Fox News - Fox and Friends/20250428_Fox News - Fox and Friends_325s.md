# 'Murderers row': White House lawn gets dramatic makeover
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ)
*  So tomorrow marks President Trump's 100th day in office as he starts his 15th week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  As Russia continues to strike Ukraine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio says this week will be [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=6.9s)]
*  critical for the negotiations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=11.36s)]
*  I think this is going to be a very critical week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=15.18s)]
*  This week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=18.18s)]
*  about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in or if it's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally if not more important in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  some cases. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=30.4s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=32.76s)]
*  Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair joins us [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=33.76s)]
*  now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=37.08s)]
*  James, great to see you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=38.08s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=39.08s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=40.08s)]
*  I think we should talk about some of that iconic shot at St. Peter's. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=41.08s)]
*  President of the United States goes to the funeral of the Pope and then at one moment [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  decides this would be a good time to talk to President Zelensky. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=49.12s)]
*  Can you give us an idea of what led to this and idea of what was accomplished? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=52.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=57.68s)]
*  I mean, obviously leading up to it, the Ukrainians have been reaching out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=58.68s)]
*  We've had ongoing conversations. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=62.44s)]
*  There was a desire, which I think President Zelensky expressed publicly, to have a pull-aside [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=64.12s)]
*  meeting there in Rome. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=68.84s)]
*  And what came out of it was progress. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, the president feels like we are making progress, but he's been frustrated [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=72.84s)]
*  at both sides, which he's made clear. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=76.32s)]
*  He said over the weekend that the Ukrainians should have signed the deal with us weeks [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=78.44s)]
*  ago and he wants them to hurry up and get that done. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=82.2s)]
*  And Putin, he is very displeased with the attacks on civilian areas last week and he's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=85.08s)]
*  put on the table increasing sanctions, secondary tariffs on oil, whatever it takes to make [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=89.56s)]
*  sure that they hurry up and get to the table and create peace. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=94.08s)]
*  What about providing patriots in more arms to Ukraine? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=96.64s)]
*  I know that's what Zelensky asked for. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=99.92s)]
*  Look, I don't have any news to break on that, but obviously we've provided a lot already. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=102.6s)]
*  What's most important is that they get to the table and hurry up and make this deal quickly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=107.76s)]
*  Do you think that is the president angry that Putin might be playing him? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=111.44s)]
*  Does he feel deceived that that indeed might be his agenda? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=115.36s)]
*  Well, look, he put out a statement, I think, two days ago on his truth where he said he [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=118.56s)]
*  does not want to be tapped along. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=122.88s)]
*  He won't accept it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=124.32s)]
*  He's displeased again with the attacks on civilian areas. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  And the president said it makes him feel like maybe he doesn't want peace as badly as he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=128.6s)]
*  says he does. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=132.68s)]
*  The president's not going to stand for that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  If that means increasing sanctions, he's obviously put that on the table. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  Steve Woodcock was optimistic. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=139.6s)]
*  The president is neither as Marco Rubio. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=141.0s)]
*  How do you deal with both those schools of thought? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=143.16s)]
*  Look, I mean, I think that, you know, this is a bit of a give and take back and forth process. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  We feel like we're making progress. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  The president feels like we're making progress, but he's also sending a message that it needs [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  to go more quickly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=156.56s)]
*  So this is today. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=157.56s)]
*  Every day is going to have a different theme here at the White House. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  At eight thirty, Caroline Levitt is going to have a start her press conference where [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=160.76s)]
*  she's going to talk about immigration, the progress of man at the border. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=164.88s)]
*  You see these signs behind us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=167.64s)]
*  All the arrests have been made over the last 100 days. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=169.76s)]
*  Homicide, child sex abuse, rape and sodomy, the mugshots of those who have been captured [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=172.92s)]
*  and taken off the streets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=177.88s)]
*  Why do you want people to see that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=179.12s)]
*  Why do you want the press to see that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=180.56s)]
*  Well, look, the mainstream media, as you know, Brian, doesn't want to cover this story. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  What we've done is get violent criminals and other lowlifes on the street. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=187.2s)]
*  It's literally a murderer's row here on the lawn of the White House. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=190.28s)]
*  And these are people that we've taken out of the country since we came into office. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=193.88s)]
*  Last month, we had the lowest border crossings on record. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=197.56s)]
*  And that's a result of not new legislation, as Biden said, we would need, but just a new [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=200.58s)]
*  president getting the job done. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=204.12s)]
*  We've reunited over 5000 children with their families or a safeguardian since we came into [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=206.06s)]
*  office. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=210.88s)]
*  We're cleaning up our communities. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=211.88s)]
*  We're getting rid of all these guys. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=212.88s)]
*  I mean, look at these. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=213.88s)]
*  These are all heinous crimes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=214.88s)]
*  These are violent crimes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=215.88s)]
*  That would be a law and order episode. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=216.88s)]
*  And we have to get all of them out of the country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  So yesterday, if you're looking for key Democratic leaders, you'd have to go to the Capitol steps [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  where they were sitting to a first sit in because they think that the big, beautiful [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  bill is going to be terrible for America. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  And the only thing they could do is sit in and sing and talk about it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=229.55999999999997s)]
*  Is the president going to change his mind because Cory Booker spent a Sunday on the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=233.14s)]
*  steps? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=236.56s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, think about what the Democrats are actually saying. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=237.56s)]
*  They're saying they're going to oppose the largest tax cut in history for middle and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=240.0s)]
*  working class Americans. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=244.92s)]
*  We're out here standing on the side of keeping illegal immigrants on Medicaid when we're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=245.92s)]
*  trying to get them off of Medicaid so we can save the program. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  The Democrats have no plan. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  Remember, this is the party that brought us four decade high inflation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=254.27999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden, Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=257.88s)]
*  We shouldn't listen to them on anything. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  Now that the adults are back in charge, we're having to clean up the mess they created for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=261.28s)]
*  us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=264.2s)]
*  And you're not going to have an easy time as you try to get all the Republicans on the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=265.2s)]
*  same page. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=266.96s)]
*  Very, you know, this slight advantage for Republicans in both the House and Senate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=267.96s)]
*  So, what are your thoughts about the so-called Salt Caucus of New York and the Northeastern, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=272.6s)]
*  the blue, the congressmen from the blue states, your thoughts about those who say, I want [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  to keep parts of the Inflation Reduction Act under Joe Biden because it would hurt their [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=281.72s)]
*  constituents? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  Look, I mean, everybody has issues that are very important to them and their constituents. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  But the fact is, there's a pathway to accomplish all of those things and at least make some [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  gain in some of those areas that people really want to see. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=296.68s)]
*  Nobody's going to get 100% of what they want. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=299.72s)]
*  But that's the democratic process, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=302.44s)]
*  And again, like I said, just a minute ago, it's up to the adults to be in charge now [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=304.08s)]
*  and we just have to get it done. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=308.0s)]
*  And you have a lot done already in 100 days. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=309.48s)]
*  James, thanks so much. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=311.64s)]
*  I know it's going to be a big week. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9YXXeX8MfQ&t=312.64s)]
