# Pentagon sets record straight on 'egregious' Elon Musk report: 'This is fake!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0)
*  I'm signing a memo directing the termination of over $580 million in DOD contracts and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=0.0s)]
*  grants that do not match the priorities of this president or this department. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=9.18s)]
*  In other words, they are not a good use of taxpayer dollars as DOD partners with DOGE [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=14.08s)]
*  here to make sure that our warfighters have what they need by cutting the waste, fraud [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=21.28s)]
*  and abuse. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=26.28s)]
*  So the Defense Department embracing DOGE as Elon Musk prepares to visit the Pentagon [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=28.12s)]
*  today and in just a few hours, Hex Seth and President Trump are expected to deliver remarks [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=32.44s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell joins us now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=40.24s)]
*  Sean, good morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=42.64s)]
*  Congratulations on the new role. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=43.64s)]
*  Thanks Lawrence. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Good morning from the Pentagon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  So Sean, you guys have already identified, you and the Secretary of Defense, $580 million [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=48.84s)]
*  of waste, fraud and abuse contracts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=55.56s)]
*  DOGE is going to be there today with Elon Musk. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=58.36s)]
*  Do you expect more cuts? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=60.84s)]
*  Well, so yeah, $800 million plus that we've saved here at the Department of Defense. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=63.0s)]
*  And really, I mean, the charge for us was very clear set forth from this president and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=68.12s)]
*  his historic mandate in November and Secretary Hex Seth's vision is to look for ways to find [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=73.16s)]
*  wasteful spending in the Pentagon and look for additional creative ways to reinvest in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=79.16s)]
*  our warfighters. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=84.36s)]
*  That's exactly what we're doing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=86.16s)]
*  And DOGE is really helping us to do that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=87.16s)]
*  We welcome them here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=88.96s)]
*  And you got to think, Lawrence, every dollar that we save here in a wasteful spending program [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=90.48s)]
*  is a dollar that we could reinvest in the warfighters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=94.68s)]
*  And Elon Musk is coming today for a Pentagon visit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=98.08s)]
*  Super excited about that, Lawrence, because Elon Musk is a patriot. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=101.72s)]
*  He's smart. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=105.32s)]
*  He's a great businessman. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=106.32s)]
*  He's an innovator. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=107.48s)]
*  We look forward to the ideas that he's bringing to us here today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=108.66s)]
*  So Sean, I've been talking with my sources and there are several reports circulating [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=111.94000000000001s)]
*  about Elon getting classified information, operation stuff. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  They tell me that's not true. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=122.26s)]
*  Can you say that on record that none of that has happened? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=124.7s)]
*  This is about the waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=127.9s)]
*  Yeah, on the record, that is completely fake. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=129.58s)]
*  And let me show you, this started with this New York Times headline and they since changed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=131.9s)]
*  it, but Musk set to get access to top secret U.S. plan for potential war with China. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  This is egregious. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=141.22s)]
*  This is fake. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=142.22s)]
*  The New York Times should retract this story. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=143.22s)]
*  Five anonymous sources. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=145.66s)]
*  I've been on bilat calls with the secretary. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=147.3s)]
*  I see how hard he's working to implement the president's agenda and pursue peace through [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=150.38s)]
*  strength. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=155.78s)]
*  This type of garbage from the New York Times undermines that process and undermines our [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=156.78s)]
*  mission. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=162.3s)]
*  It shouldn't happen at all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=163.3s)]
*  Elon Musk is just coming over here for a visit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=164.42s)]
*  Again, he's an innovator. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=167.66s)]
*  This is a guy that shot a rocket at thousands of miles an hour that's thousands of pounds [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=169.54s)]
*  and as it landed back on the earth, it was grabbed out of midair by a giant robot arm. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  We want a guy like Elon Musk in the Defense Department to help us come up with creative [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  solutions to the problems that we face today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  But this article, this article is ridiculous. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  It's fake. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  And I can confirm that on the record. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  It's just hurtful to the country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=191.89999999999998s)]
*  Talk about what's happening in Oval today with the president as well as the Secretary [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=193.42s)]
*  of Defense. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, I can't scoop the president and I'm certainly not going to scoop the Secretary [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=198.58s)]
*  of Defense. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=202.94s)]
*  But listen, you're going to want to make sure that you watch what happens with Secretary [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=203.94s)]
*  Haig, Seth and President Trump in the Oval Office at 11. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=207.82s)]
*  It's going to be huge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=210.94s)]
*  Roger that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=211.94s)]
*  So Sean, tell me there's been a lot of mission, malicious compliance going on at your department [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=212.94s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  I saw that Jackie Robinson was removed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  This happened early on in the administration when it came down to the to Sigeeghi Airmen [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=225.96s)]
*  What is happening behind the scenes to get those people out of the department? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=227.08s)]
*  Because I know the secretary, I know he knows who Jackie Robinson is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=231.52s)]
*  I know he wouldn't order this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=234.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're exactly right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=236.0s)]
*  I mean, basically, there are hundreds of thousands of pieces of content here, DEI content that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=238.8s)]
*  is spread across the force. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=244.84s)]
*  We gave the force an aggressive deadline to remove divisive DEI content. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=246.82000000000002s)]
*  They have moved out in support of that mission. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=251.58s)]
*  It was a Herculean task. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=254.28s)]
*  And what we use were keyword searches and AI tools, basically software to help us comb [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  through all of this data. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=260.3s)]
*  And as a result, some of some things were removed either by accident. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=262.41999999999996s)]
*  Some things were removed maliciously. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=266.68s)]
*  But the bottom line is, is that regardless of how they were removed, we're going to fix [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=268.74s)]
*  them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=274.88s)]
*  And so, yeah, the secretary's guidance was not and has never been to remove historical [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=275.88s)]
*  figures or professional athletes from our websites or anything like that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=281.38s)]
*  So there is malicious compliance going on here at the Department of Defense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=287.9s)]
*  We know that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=292.68s)]
*  And we saw that in the president's first term. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=293.68s)]
*  We see that a little bit today, but we're not going to allow that to happen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  We're not going to allow that to detract from President Trump's vision and Secretary [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=299.3s)]
*  Hicks' vision here at the Pentagon. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=302.3s)]
*  We're going to get the job done. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=304.06s)]
*  Well done, because American history is not DEI. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=305.06s)]
*  DEI is DEI. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=307.78s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=308.78s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=309.78s)]
*  I'm going to record straight this morning. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=310.78s)]
*  You got it, Lawrence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=312.5s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnqnvOPaN_0&t=313.5s)]
