# Jonathan Turley: The Bidens are the GOATs of influence peddling
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI)
*  Meanwhile, it is brand new op ed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan Turley says President Biden cemented his legacy [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  as a liar in chief as his pardon of son Hunter [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=4.92s)]
*  culminates years of lying to the public [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=9.28s)]
*  about his knowledge and intentions [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=10.96s)]
*  in the influence peddling scandals surrounding his family. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=12.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, special counsel David Weiss [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=15.68s)]
*  objecting to the motion to dismiss Hunter's case. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=17.28s)]
*  The GW law professor and Fox has contributed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Jonathan Turley heard us talking about him [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=23.28s)]
*  and scrambled to the Zoom and joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=24.84s)]
*  So, Jonathan, first off, on David Weiss saying, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=28.32s)]
*  I don't think we should go ahead [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=31.28s)]
*  and follow through on the pardon, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=32.44s)]
*  we should follow through on the case. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=33.88s)]
*  Your thought? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=35.0s)]
*  I think it's just positively nuts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=36.8s)]
*  Of course he should dismiss the case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=39.44s)]
*  I think it's an effort to try to scrub away [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=40.92s)]
*  the stain of this case for Weiss. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=43.32s)]
*  He was at the center of that sweetheart deal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=45.8s)]
*  He wanted to give the Bidens precisely [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=48.32s)]
*  what the president just gave in this pardon, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=51.28s)]
*  a sweeping immunity for not just crimes he was accused of, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=53.6s)]
*  but other unnamed crimes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=57.04s)]
*  He's not gonna scrub that away. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=58.76s)]
*  And saying that I'd like to stay in this fight [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=60.64s)]
*  a little bit longer is unlikely to impress these judges. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  This is not here to redeem yourself. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=66.8s)]
*  It's the question is, is there a case to be tried? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=69.88s)]
*  And the answer is no, there's not. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=72.24s)]
*  You also believe that Hunter Biden [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=74.88s)]
*  might not be out of trouble yet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=76.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=77.8s)]
*  Well, the president clearly is hoping [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=79.56s)]
*  that he's given him this sweeping protection [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  and that includes unnamed crimes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=84.32s)]
*  Quite literally, Hunter Biden could have six heads [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=86.36s)]
*  in a duffel bag in his basement and this would cover it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=90.48s)]
*  as long as he committed those murders [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=93.76s)]
*  during this 10 year period. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=97.28s)]
*  It would not protect him by the way from state charges, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=98.96s)]
*  but it's a sweeping pardon that we haven't seen really [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=102.52s)]
*  the likes of since Nixon. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=106.76s)]
*  It's pretty unprecedented in that respect. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=108.68s)]
*  The problem is that Hunter could be called before Congress. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=111.12s)]
*  Congress has committees that are still looking [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=114.32s)]
*  into the influence peddling scandal [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  involving millions and millions of dollars. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=119.52s)]
*  He could be called to testify. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  Last time he did that, the house accused him [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=124.72s)]
*  of being misleading, even false in his testimony. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  If he commits perjury again, it's a new crime [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=130.64s)]
*  and this pardon will not have an impact [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=134.16s)]
*  and he could face additional charges. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=136.56s)]
*  You also write that he might not have to pay all his taxes [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  and number two is there are so many questions. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=142.08s)]
*  What'd you do with the money in China? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=144.36s)]
*  What'd you do with the money you got from Moscow mayor? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=145.8s)]
*  How did you get the money from the Romanian billionaire? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  What about Carlos Slim? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=150.72s)]
*  Are we ever gonna, is he ever gonna have to pay taxes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=153.08s)]
*  on this or answer the question, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=155.28s)]
*  what did you do to earn that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think he should be called to Congress [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=159.72s)]
*  and called to give a full account. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of questions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  The Bidens have been notorious for nepotism [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  and influence peddling. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=169.52s)]
*  I've been writing about them from before [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=172.12s)]
*  Biden was vice president. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=173.68s)]
*  They are the goats of this favorite form of corruption [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  in DC, which is influence peddling. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=181.36s)]
*  And this pardon really sealed that status. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=183.8s)]
*  I mean, we've never seen anything like them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=187.88s)]
*  I mean, they have done an amazing job [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  in avoiding any responsibility, accountability [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=193.0s)]
*  or even answers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=196.32s)]
*  Congress can demand those answers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=197.68s)]
*  Would be nice and he could always take the fifth, I guess. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=199.76s)]
*  Is there any doubt in your mind that Jim Biden [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=202.72s)]
*  and the whole family gets a pardon? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=204.6s)]
*  The brother is next? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, this seems to be a free fall [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=209.92s)]
*  for the Biden administration in terms of ethics. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is the final corruption, in my view, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  of the Biden administration. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=217.88s)]
*  They have really untethered themselves from any principles. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=219.32s)]
*  So nothing would surprise me at this point. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=222.48s)]
*  All right, I am surprised that you're at Amelia Island [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=224.6s)]
*  and you agreed to do this hit in the morning. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  I'd be out in a boat or I'd be stunning myself [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  in the Hilton at the bar. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=232.16s)]
*  Thanks so much, appreciate it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzJjOwK8oI&t=233.76s)]
