# Actors go behind-the-scenes to Trump making Hollywood great again
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck)
*  This week actor John Voight planning to pitch his plan to President Trump to make Hollywood [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=0.0s)]
*  more MAGA friendly as more than 8,000 films and TV jobs have left the US over the last [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=7.2s)]
*  three years for lower labor costs. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=13.52s)]
*  Our next guests know all about the inner workings of Hollywood. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=16.3s)]
*  Actor Dean Cain and producer Michael Miller join us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=19.34s)]
*  Hey guys, it's so great to have you on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=23.34s)]
*  I'm so fascinated with the story. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=25.0s)]
*  Not just because I'm an American and I think Hollywood is America. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=27.28s)]
*  It's an industry that only should be ours and not go to other countries. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=31.76s)]
*  I have a son in the industry as well. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  So I'm really concerned about what's happening. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=38.6s)]
*  Dean, I'm going to start with you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=40.68s)]
*  Read this article in the New York Times saying it's not feeling like we're Hollywood anymore. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=43.2s)]
*  It says that the entertainment industry is going to become what Detroit was to, or California [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=47.36s)]
*  is to the entertainment industry. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=54.6s)]
*  What Detroit is to the auto industry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  It's really dire. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  I don't think Americans understand how bad it is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  No, I mean, that's one of the things we export the most from our country is our culture. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=62.72s)]
*  And that's the films and the things that we make. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=68.84s)]
*  The fact that they've made it so difficult to be working in California is the biggest [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=71.32s)]
*  problem there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=78.36s)]
*  The regulations and the ridiculous policies make it almost impossible to film there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  So everybody is fleeing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=84.28s)]
*  Just the fact that President Trump named John Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=85.92s)]
*  three legends to this advisory board, gives some cache to some folks who were otherwise [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=90.72s)]
*  ostracized for being conservatives in Hollywood. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=99.02s)]
*  And I think that's a great first step. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=101.48s)]
*  I'm interested to see what John has to say. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=103.4s)]
*  They're all guys that I know and respect tremendously. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=105.62s)]
*  So it's going to be interesting, but I think it's a tall task. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=112.2s)]
*  And Michael, we've had you on this topic before I had you back because you actually put budgets [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=113.2s)]
*  together. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  So you understand very intimately how much cheaper it is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Can you explain to our viewers why so much of the industry is getting offshored right [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  now? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=128.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=129.16s)]
*  Good morning, by the way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=130.16s)]
*  The scale of it, if you will. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=131.16s)]
*  And Dean touched on what I addressed when you guys had me on about four months ago, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=134.16s)]
*  overregulations in California are wild. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=139.6s)]
*  And right now, when all of these states are offering a 30% incentive to take the industry [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=143.48s)]
*  and shoot in Georgia, Connecticut, other states, I was asking for four months ago for the governor [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  to enact something simple, match the Georgia tax incentives. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=155.78s)]
*  California now, four months later, still talking about it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  Super complicated formula. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  I can address many of the shows, type of shows that I do, unscripted alternative programming, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=166.0s)]
*  which are a huge part of Hollywood output. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=170.76s)]
*  It's just very, very difficult and sad to see so many jobs leaving there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=174.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=178.24s)]
*  And it's so hard to live in California when we saw the inept government at its worst during [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=179.24s)]
*  the wildfires. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  So difficult to live in California. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=186.54s)]
*  You're competing with states like Georgia, Las Vegas, New Mexico, and now you have Ireland. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=188.0s)]
*  I mean, I just read in this article. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=193.44s)]
*  It's cheaper to hire a seven crew grip crew. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=195.92s)]
*  It costs less than one grip in California because of all the costs associated. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  Dean? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=207.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=208.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, it makes it impossible. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=209.64s)]
*  I mean, it's a business. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=210.64s)]
*  And as Michael touched on, it's impossible to make a film for XYZ numbers when you have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=211.64s)]
*  a very limited budget. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  So you look for what's the best deal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  Everybody's going to look for the best deal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  So you look for the best deal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=223.04s)]
*  And if it's in Georgia, I've shot one film in California in the last five years. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  And I wrote it, produced it, and directed it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  It comes out June 6th, by the way, Little Angels. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=231.12s)]
*  But finally. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  But other than that, I've been everywhere. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  My next three films are going to shoot in Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's just the way it is. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=241.6s)]
*  So they're driving people out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=242.88s)]
*  And as far as going overseas, I mean, that's a location issue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=244.72s)]
*  I've shot some films in Bulgaria and places like that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=248.32s)]
*  We used to outsource a lot to Canada, but that's changing, too. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=250.64s)]
*  It's all about financial policy and regulation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=254.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=257.12s)]
*  I'm hearing that the English-speaking world, Australia, Ireland, these countries are benefiting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=258.12s)]
*  from the fact that California and Hollywood can't get their act together and make it affordable [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=264.2s)]
*  to make films here and employ Americans in California. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=268.64s)]
*  Michael, Dean, it's great talking to you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=272.4s)]
*  Thanks for making this issue, putting it up front. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=275.84s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=278.76s)]
*  We do export culture and it will change if we start to see it go overseas. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=279.88s)]
*  It will be a different culture. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=284.84s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=286.32s)]
*  Hopefully it will. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=287.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=288.32s)]
*  Thank you both so much. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=289.32s)]
*  Important topic. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=290.32s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=291.32s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=292.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRyZ7-rfck&t=293.32s)]
