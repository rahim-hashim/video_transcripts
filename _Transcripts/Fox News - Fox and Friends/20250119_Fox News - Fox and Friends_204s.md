# 'HERE FOR THE 47': Trump supporters line up ahead of DC victory rally
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc)
*  This morning, President-elect Trump is set to have breakfast [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=0.0s)]
*  with GOP senators before visiting Arlington Cemetery [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=3.0s)]
*  for the changing of the guard and the laying of the wreath. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=6.34s)]
*  He then heads to the Capital One Arena [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=10.34s)]
*  to speak at a MAGA victory rally [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=13.14s)]

*  and joins us right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=22.38s)]
*  And, Griff, because they canceled the parade [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=23.72s)]
*  and all those people behind you were gonna be at the parade tomorrow, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=26.82s)]
*  but there is no parade. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=29.72s)]
*  So they want to be able to see the president, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=31.22s)]
*  and that's why some of them started standing in line [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=33.22s)]
*  a couple days ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=36.22s)]
*  That's right. Good morning, Steve. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=40.22s)]
*  And this crowd is growing here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=41.72s)]
*  The weather's not even bad. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=43.72s)]
*  You can see they are ready for that MAGA victory rally. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=45.22s)]
*  President-elect Trump's gonna speak. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=49.22s)]
*  Vance is gonna speak. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=51.22s)]
*  Elon's gonna speak. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=52.72s)]

*  But let's start talking to people here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=59.22s)]
*  What's your name? Where are you from? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=60.72s)]
*  My name is Barbara. I'm from New York. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=62.22s)]

*  I'm absolutely ready. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=66.22s)]
*  I went to the MSG rally, but I'm gonna tell you something. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=67.72s)]
*  I came to America 47 years ago yesterday, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=70.72s)]
*  and now I'm here today to witness, well, tomorrow, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=73.72s)]
*  the 47th president. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=76.72s)]
*  You can't make that up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=78.22s)]
*  What does this mean to you? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=79.72s)]
*  It means a lot to me because my great-grandfather was a miner, okay? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=80.72s)]
*  And then he had, my grandmother was born in West Virginia. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=84.72s)]
*  So then my father came here with my brother. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=88.22s)]
*  They worked hard and they brought all of us back to America. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=90.72s)]
*  And we came here for the better tomorrow, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=93.72s)]
*  the American opportunity, the land of opportunity. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=96.72s)]
*  That's what we came for. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=99.72s)]
*  And you got a tattoo going here, too. Where are you from? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=101.22s)]
*  I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=103.72s)]

*  Did you get that tattoo because of Pete Hegseth? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=125.22s)]
*  Well, Pete Hegseth, yeah, you're right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=127.22s)]
*  But look at, I have the 45 right here, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn_UkbQrXNc&t=130.22s)]
