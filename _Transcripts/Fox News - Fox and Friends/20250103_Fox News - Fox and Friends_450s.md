# Biden reportedly weighed strikes on Iranian nuclear sites
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA)
*  the FBI is changing their assessment after saying they believe there could be additional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=0.0s)]
*  suspects in the New Orleans terror attack. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=7.28s)]
*  Let me be very clear about this point. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=11.28s)]
*  This was an act of terrorism. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=13.64s)]
*  We do not assess at this point that anyone else involved in this attack is involved in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=16.34s)]
*  this attack except for Shamsa Dinn Jabbar, the subject you've already been briefed on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=22.82s)]
*  He served in the military for a period of time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=29.46s)]
*  Here to discuss all this is retired four-star general Jack Keene. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=33.1s)]
*  But before we get to Jack Keene, I want to just go over some of the history and some [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=36.78s)]
*  of the organizations to reframe your mind. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=40.54s)]
*  We talk about this every day. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=43.22s)]
*  I mean, let's go back to Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=44.660000000000004s)]
*  In the 1980s, they emerged right in the Gaza West Bank area. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=46.8s)]
*  Their goal as a Sunni extremist organization to oust all Western culture, especially Israel, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  from what they consider Palestine, which it's not. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=58.7s)]
*  They still exist today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=61.02s)]
*  They are financed and loosely affiliated with Iran. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=62.02s)]
*  But they're Shia Iran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=65.58s)]
*  Brings us to al-Qaeda, emerged really during the Soviet Union occupation of Afghanistan, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=67.3s)]
*  led by Osama bin Laden, famously. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=72.38s)]
*  They were really kicked out of Saudi Arabia where it started. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=74.54s)]
*  They took root over in Pakistan, Afghanistan region. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=77.30000000000001s)]
*  They also had a presence in Sudan. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=80.66s)]
*  The relevance today, their branches are still operating in and around there and gave birth [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=82.54s)]
*  to some derivatives who they often brawl with. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=87.06s)]
*  One of those derivatives is ISIS, famously called by four-star General Austin at the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  time and who was told, President Biden at the time, don't worry about it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  They're really not a big deal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  They're like the JV team. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=102.18s)]
*  They're not the JV team. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=104.22s)]
*  They can be, they are famed for being able to inspire people without training them in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=105.76s)]
*  person. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=110.7s)]
*  And of course, this latest attack in New Orleans, this suspect who is now dead was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=111.7s)]
*  inspired by ISIS. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=116.78s)]
*  So let's talk to General Jack Keene about all this, the Chairman for the Institute of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  Study of War. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=123.26s)]
*  So General, as we're going to weave in some of the incidents that have happened over the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=124.54s)]
*  last year of terror attacks around the world, how do we stop this? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=128.74s)]
*  Is there something we could do in the Middle East to stop what's happening in the West? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=133.02s)]
*  Well, certainly at the foundation of all of this is an ideology that perpetuates it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=138.3s)]
*  And they have a big idea and it's difficult to defeat an idea like that, given the roots [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=144.34s)]
*  that exist in some of these countries to help fester and grow that idea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  But all three of those terrorist organizations are mere shadows of the former self, Brian. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=154.3s)]
*  Let's face it, Hamas has decimated, Al-Qaeda has never actually recovered from taking down [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  Osama bin Laden and his entire network. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=167.1s)]
*  They still exist. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=169.78s)]
*  They're still a threat, but they're not on the stage that they used to be as major global [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=170.78s)]
*  threat. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=174.46s)]
*  ISIS had a caliphate and that was destroyed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration dismantled it in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=178.98s)]
*  Now, the fact is that there are hotspots around the world. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=183.18s)]
*  There's still radical Islamist organizations in 40 countries and the hotspots, fortunately, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=187.1s)]
*  are not in the United States. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=192.14s)]
*  These are organizations that exist. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=193.7s)]
*  They have networks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=196.06s)]
*  They do planned and premeditated attacks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=197.74s)]
*  And they're taking place in Africa, in Mali, in Kenya, in Niger, in Somalia, in Indonesia, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=200.3s)]
*  in Southeast Asia, and obviously in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where there is a rise of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  ISIS and their desire to conduct attacks outside of Afghanistan. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=212.58s)]
*  We've already seen it in Iran and in Europe. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=217.7s)]
*  And certainly the United States is trying to keep its eye on that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=220.7s)]
*  As you pointed out early in the show, we don't have our eyes and ears. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  We closed our multiple CIA bases and we certainly have no one on the ground to keep an eye on [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=226.94s)]
*  that threat. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=231.94s)]
*  But nonetheless, the United States is not one of the hotspots where radical Islam extremism [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  is on the rise. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=238.9s)]
*  It is in some other places in the world and we have to maintain our diligence. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=240.58s)]
*  I'm not saying we ease up on anything. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=244.78s)]
*  We've got good intelligence. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=247.38s)]
*  We have good counterterrorism organizations that we've put together after 9-11, where [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=248.62s)]
*  we're coordinating these activities and watching them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  But here we don't have networks that we're dealing against. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=257.14s)]
*  We don't have an organization that we're dealing against. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=260.62s)]
*  We're dealing with a lone wolf who's very hard to penetrate that person, an individual [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  on the Internet, that's getting more and more radicalized and then makes a decision to jihad [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=268.26s)]
*  and use violence against his own people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=274.26s)]
*  It's very difficult to discern that and prevent it, obviously. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=277.70000000000005s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=281.26000000000005s)]
*  So when President Trump takes over on January 20th, he's got a situation in the Middle East [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=282.26000000000005s)]
*  simmering, a lot of people waiting for him, maybe Netanyahu is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  There's a report today in Axios that Joe Biden discussed plans to strike Iran's nuclear sites [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=291.06s)]
*  if Tehran was speeding towards a bomb. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  I heard they are speeding towards a bomb. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=299.66s)]
*  Do you look at that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=302.54s)]
*  Do your sources say the same thing? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=303.54s)]
*  Well, here's the issue. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=308.26s)]
*  I mean, the Iranians have a decision to make. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=309.26s)]
*  And look at what happened to them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=311.78s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah decimated. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=312.94s)]
*  Hezbollah was the organization that they created to protect Iran from Israel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=314.73999999999995s)]
*  And that organization also has got major problems. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=320.58s)]
*  They've lost their strategic platform in Syria. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=323.97999999999996s)]
*  They are defenseless at home because Israel stripped away their air defense system. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=327.0s)]
*  They can't even protect their leaders in Tehran, to be frank about it, much less their nuclear [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  systems and their rockets and missiles. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=335.82s)]
*  So what's their choice? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=337.97999999999996s)]
*  What they want to do more than anything else is preserve their regime. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=340.05999999999995s)]
*  They've always thought a nuclear weapon would do that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  They believe Saddam Hussein would still be in power today and so would Gaddafi if they [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=346.26s)]
*  had pursued a nuclear weapon successfully. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=351.11999999999995s)]
*  Are they now going to pursue that and get there in a matter of months? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=353.97999999999996s)]
*  That remains to be seen. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=358.58s)]
*  I think our intelligence agencies are watching it like a hawk. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=359.58s)]
*  I know where Prime Minister Netanyahu is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  He wants to eliminate this threat. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=366.3s)]
*  He sees this as a strategic opportunity. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  They're defenseless. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  They're not going to be able to retaliate very much because they've taken down a lot [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  of their rockets and missiles and they can do more of that with a strike that goes after [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=374.82000000000005s)]
*  their nuclear system. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  I know he's talking to President Trump and their advisors here and likely they're working [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  through options, hopefully together, to deal with this threat. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  I think it's a strategic opportunity and you could force Iran to dismantle the system [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=388.22s)]
*  by a date certain, bring inspectors in to verify, US regional inspectors, UN inspectors, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=394.22s)]
*  or go after it kinetically and take it down once and for all. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=400.18s)]
*  I think Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to eliminate this threat once and for all. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=403.42s)]
*  He knows Iran is on its heels and now is the time to take this thing off the board, frankly. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=407.38000000000005s)]
*  You know, General, the other thing would be Netanyahu, who's not going to ask for much, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  let him do it instead of getting in his way or tipping off the Iranians. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5_zKiwXVZA&t=417.02s)]
