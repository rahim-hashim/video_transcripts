# 'It had to be done': Luigi Mangione left 'disturbing' message in manifesto
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8)
*  All right, buck up we begin with a Fox News alert the suspect in the killing of the United healthcare CEO Brian Thompson [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=0.0s)]
*  Has been charged after being arrested Monday at a McDonald's in Altuna [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=5.76s)]
*  Pennsylvania right now. He's being held at a jail and in Huntington, Pennsylvania [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Yep, Alexis McAdams has been covering the case all week long from the time of the shooting actually within the hour [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=17.56s)]
*  Alexis is now joining us here Alexis bit of a surprise that we found him in Altuna [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  That's right, and it came in from a 9-1-1 call from a worker of that McDonald's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  So that's how this case ended up breaking according to authorities [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=34.08s)]
*  So the manhunt for the killer now ending at that McDonald's in Pennsylvania Luigi Mangione is facing a wide range of charges now [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=37.04s)]
*  Including murder right here in New York City. So the 26 year old you see him there on your screen [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=44.16s)]
*  He was cuffed then walked out of a Pennsylvania Police Department overnight [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=48.36s)]
*  He's kind of looking around at the media seeing who's out there and there were a lot of cameras [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=52.76s)]
*  Capturing his every move Mangione then stood in front of a judge who explained that he could be extradited to New York City [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=56.88s)]
*  Because he was hit with some charges in Pennsylvania [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=63.28s)]
*  But the ones in New York City are the ones that are the most serious including murder [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=65.96s)]
*  So this comes after in McDonald's employee spots Mangione in Altuna, Pennsylvania [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=69.68s)]
*  It's like a four and a half hour drive away from where this murder happened that person called [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=75.02s)]
*  911 to report the sighting saying I think I recognize the guy in the wanted pictures [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=80.08s)]
*  specifically his eyebrows and his eyes because he was wearing some type of surgical mask as he was eating inside that McDonald's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=84.92s)]
*  Mangione was sitting there wearing that mask when officers pulled up and asked him some questions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  They said remove your mask and then questioned the 26 year old who they say started shaking [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=96.0s)]
*  Visibly acting really nervous when they asked him were you recently in New York? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  Then he handed over a fake ID and that's key because he used that fake ID sources tell me to check into a New York City [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=105.33999999999999s)]
*  Hostel before the shooting mayor Eric Adams has been thanking the officer out in Altuna who caught Mangione listen [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=111.22s)]
*  Hey, Tyler, I guess we found your guy [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=118.94s)]
*  We as New Yorkers we appreciate it and you just did a great job heads up policing [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=122.3s)]

*  Yeah, and that's the thing you just have to keep your eye out and that's exactly what the worker did at McDonald's and the authority [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=135.68s)]
*  Is there an L tuna Mangione is facing these charges on your screen [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=140.76s)]

*  They believe he printed on a 3d printer Mangione had a backpack with them at the time of the arrest [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=149.4s)]
*  Inside was a handwritten note that they say explained a possible motive [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=155.4s)]
*  Talking all about how he was in severe back pain and talking about the health care industry saying it was a big scam [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=159.2s)]
*  Also inside was a weapon the Ivy League grad and Maryland native who went to a really, you know [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=165.44s)]
*  Expensive prep school and then went to UPenn reportedly mentioned United Health Care by name reading this they say [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=171.72s)]
*  Parasites had it coming. I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=178.12s)]
*  So some disturbing words there that will all be part of this case. This is who was killed on your screen [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=183.44s)]
*  It was a data to is only 50 years old in town for work [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=188.34s)]
*  He worked for United Health Care for like two decades and was shot at least two times in that video [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=190.98s)]
*  We kind of get shot in the leg first then shot right in the chest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=195.82s)]
*  He leaves behind a wife and two kids Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro making sure people in their community [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=198.78s)]
*  No, he was not a hero this gunman [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=204.74s)]
*  in some dark corners [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=208.06s)]
*  This killer is being hailed as a hero [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=210.1s)]
*  Hear me on this. He is no hero [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  The real hero in this story is the person who called 9-1-1 at McDonald's this morning [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=217.94s)]
*  So Josh Shapiro using that moment to let everybody know [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  You know how he personally felt about some of the important behavior of people who thought this guy was anything but a murderer [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=228.7s)]
*  But let's focus on the manifesto if we can [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  Handwritten two and a half pages condemn the health care system the document specifically mentioned United Health Care the insurance giant [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=237.9s)]
*  Also, as you said before [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=245.82s)]
*  One of the quotes was these they called him parasites [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=247.94s)]
*  He saw the document he says I do apologize for the strife and trauma you think [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=250.66s)]
*  As I killed the father of your family and your husband [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=255.5s)]
*  I apologize for that but it's clear there was one person who is the high school valedictorian [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=258.5s)]
*  Want to you pen and it seems to be a different person now [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=264.66s)]
*  Yeah, something changed you can listen to his speech when he was a valedictorian [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=267.82s)]
*  You know at that prep school in Maryland and he's talking all about how the class there in 2016 [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  Wanted to get out there into the world and make a big difference [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=276.17999999999995s)]
*  And now you look at you know, we had a bright future his family had posted about that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=278.7s)]
*  He was very intelligent in the classroom and now with this he's looking, you know to spend the rest of his life behind bars [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=282.46s)]
*  well [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=287.62s)]
*  and people are starting to do a deep dive on his online profile and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=288.14s)]
*  I believe it was the Wall Street Journal looked at the reviews he wrote on books [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  He had read and among other things he he gave a book about the Unabomber's manifesto for stars [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=297.3s)]
*  And we don't know exactly why if this guy is the guy right now. He is [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=303.74s)]
*  You know [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=309.62s)]
*  He's still the alleged shooter [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=311.18s)]
*  But it is interesting when you start to look at his online stuff his his ex account formerly known as Twitter [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=314.42s)]
*  Features what looks like an x-ray of somebody who's gone through spinal surgery [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=321.78s)]
*  That's right [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=325.38s)]
*  And you know people who've known him say that back pain affected all parts of his life guys 26 years old [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=325.97999999999996s)]
*  Was he just kicked off his parents health insurance? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=332.9s)]
*  Is that why if he's the guy who did it is that why this person wrote denied delayed deposed on those bullets? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=335.7s)]
*  It's dirt. There are a lot of clues. We just haven't figured them all out unless it's the obvious one [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=349.73999999999995s)]
*  He had also written on social media and in some of these other things in the manifesto about how he's in severe pain [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=350.38s)]
*  He used to be a really good soccer player [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=355.82s)]
*  Some of his friends had said in high school and he was very active when he lived in Hawaii [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=357.62s)]
*  He was always hiking and doing all these things and then he kept talking about how his back hurt so bad from whatever had happened [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=361.42s)]
*  I don't know what type of injury and how the hospital it wasn't the doctor's fault [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=366.94s)]
*  He kept saying but they would deny his claims. So yeah the insurer. Yes the insurance company [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=369.98s)]
*  So we're gonna have to see you know what happened here [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=374.54s)]
*  But I think it's so disturbing that so many people like you guys mentioned, you know are cheering on [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=376.70000000000005s)]
*  The gunman and saying that he did a job that needed to be done [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=381.38000000000005s)]
*  I'm worried about that and as someone that I cover crime you've covered crime for years [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=384.74s)]
*  It's not only that there are people that are celebrating this guy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=390.42s)]
*  But it's also his plight of people being upset with the health care industry [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=394.3s)]
*  the fact that people [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=398.70000000000005s)]
*  Almost find him sympathetic even if you start to get deeper and if this allegation about the back pain being [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=400.18s)]
*  so much [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  Painful that led him to the trigger. I'm I'm concerned of the jury [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=407.7s)]
*  There there's someone in there that can relate that will let a guy like this off. I've never seen anything like this before [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  I know and then as the investigation continues yesterday, you know, we saw so many divers out there in Central Park [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=417.42s)]
*  They were searching for any evidence they could find like the other backpack that had monopoly money in it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=422.28s)]
*  So that could come into play in courtroom and then also the backpack he had with him in El tuna that backpack had a weapon [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  They don't know if that's a specific weapon I'm told that was used in the shooting [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=432.3s)]
*  So did he print multiple guns? Did he have other possible sus or up, you know possible victims that could have been coming? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=435.5s)]
*  We don't know [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=440.58s)]
*  It's hard to even believe that you can you can do that one of his so he lived in the surf break co-living community in Honolulu [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=440.98s)]
*  Residents there said that he did have chronic back pain. Here is one of his roommates [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=448.38s)]
*  I don't know if this is a college roommate or someone from college [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=452.94s)]
*  Hawaii. All right, listen to this [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=456.86s)]
*  Unfathomable [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=459.86s)]
*  Knowing the kind, you know person that I saw in you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=461.14s)]
*  I remember he said he had a back issue and he was hoping to get stronger in Hawaii [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=463.66s)]
*  It also weighed on him that he knew that there was an impending surgery [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=467.5s)]
*  So we're wondering is that what caused him to snap was he in so much pain? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=472.74s)]
*  But now he's gonna be sleeping on a bed in a prison. Yeah, the pain is gonna be worse. That's right [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=476.94s)]
*  They have him in a holding cell. He's gonna be possibly, you know in federal lockup [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=482.38s)]
*  If you look at the charges that could come from printing a gun, you know [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=485.64s)]
*  I don't know what kind of facility he'll be in but yeah [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=488.24s)]
*  He's gonna have big problems here down the road and you've got a wonder to did his family did anybody recognize those pictures? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=490.76s)]
*  How did a you know a guy to McDonald's and I'll do is say hey [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=496.6s)]
*  I think I've seen that man and the family did not according to investigators [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=499.2s)]

*  They don't want it to get to court possibly and then have this thing flip [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=523.6600000000001s)]
*  So they just charged him with that for now [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=527.24s)]
*  But also the question is did he really want to get this specific CEO or was he looking for anybody that was coming in? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=528.9200000000001s)]

*  It would be somebody with that resume. That's right. Yeah background in engineering two degrees from you pen [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=559.48s)]
*  And this is what he used it for so we're gonna have to see what plays out here [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDaOA77qfg8&t=564.28s)]
