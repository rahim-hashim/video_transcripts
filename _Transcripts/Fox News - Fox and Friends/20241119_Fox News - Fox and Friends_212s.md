# Piers Morgan: The 'wokesters' took on Elon Musk and LOST
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY)
*  Piers Morgan warning in his latest op-ed, the more toddler tantrum throwing liberals [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=0.0s)]
*  gnash their teeth, stamp their feet and shave their hair, the more ridiculous and irrelevant [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=4.4s)]
*  they sound. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=8.96s)]
*  Piers Morgan joins us now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=9.96s)]
*  Piers, you can't say you're surprised by this reaction, or are you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=10.96s)]
*  I'm not surprised, Brian. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=15.08s)]
*  They are reverting to type. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=17.52s)]
*  We saw all this in 2016. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=19.04s)]
*  We're seeing it now with bells on. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=20.48s)]
*  But honestly, I've just had enough of it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=22.96s)]
*  Will they just shut up? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=25.28s)]
*  If they're not shaving their heads, screaming and posting the videos to TikTok, or they're [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  disowning their Republican boyfriends for having audacity to vote for a president who [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=32.64s)]
*  just won by a landslide, then they're now all running off ex-Elon Musk's social media [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=37.64s)]
*  platform. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=43.16s)]
*  They're all quitting because they say it's toxic and they can't bear it any longer. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=44.16s)]
*  What they really mean is they are sick and tired of people messaging them, gloating about [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=48.84s)]
*  the fact they called this election spectacularly wrong. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  This election was an utter repudiation of everything they stand for. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=57.08s)]
*  The woke world just got taken to the woodshed and chopped up, and they cannot handle it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=62.0s)]
*  And Piers, you predicted, by the way, just for the record, you predicted one of the first [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=68.24s)]
*  that would be the greatest comeback ever and that it would be a big win, just so everybody [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=71.32s)]
*  knows. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=75.68s)]
*  Lastly, also insincerity. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=76.68s)]
*  You look at Joe and Mika. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=79.12s)]
*  They met with Hitler over the weekend. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=80.76s)]
*  Then we find out that Joe Biden, democracy's over if Trump wins. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=82.88s)]
*  Hey, Donald, why don't you come over and visit the White House? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=86.2s)]
*  They shake hands and talk for two hours. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=88.88s)]
*  Don't they know they've been played? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, it does make you wonder, doesn't it? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Supposedly he's a fascist, he's the new Hitler, he's going to be an existential threat to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=95.96s)]
*  American democracy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=100.2s)]
*  That's what people like Joe and Mika and what's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and everybody [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=101.44s)]
*  else, all the liberals, have been screaming for years on end. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  And yet the moment he wins, suddenly Biden's inviting him to the White House, Joe and Mika [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=109.4s)]
*  are trolling down to Mur-a-Lago. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=113.64s)]
*  But to give you some idea of the hysteria, Brian, over here in the UK, we have a bridge [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  called the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  And the Clifton Suspension Bridge has actually announced they are quitting Twitter. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=124.52s)]
*  It's a bridge. It's not even a human being. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=129.04s)]
*  It is a bridge and they are quitting Twitter. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=131.68s)]
*  So we'll no longer around the world get our updates from the Clifton Suspension Bridge. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=134.32s)]
*  These people are completely insane. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=139.0s)]
*  And we should, I think now, see them and care for them and put our arms around them because [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=141.56s)]
*  they are mentally unwell. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=147.12s)]
*  But it's also worth bringing up in the last minute we have, Piers, that advertisers, while [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  they might, the Guardian and others might be leaving Twitter, advertisers are coming [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=153.8s)]
*  back to Twitter, which is now X. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=157.72s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  It tells me that Elon Musk is now the second most powerful man in America and all these [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=162.56s)]
*  advertisers who try to take him on and try to score points and try to play the woke card [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=166.84s)]
*  against him, which is ironic because, of course, he, like Trump, like most of Trump's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=171.12s)]
*  cabinet, used to be Democrats, but then just realized they couldn't deal any longer with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=175.56s)]
*  this insane woke mentality. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  It shows me that Trump has now got this guy, Elon Musk, at his side and all the advertisers [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=182.72s)]
*  who ran away from Musk are now realizing they put all their chips on red in the casino and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=188.08s)]
*  it just came up black and they better get their acting gear because I suspect that X [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  that Elon Musk is involved in is going to be looked upon very favorably by Donald Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=198.16s)]
*  Now he's president of the United States again. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=203.32s)]
*  So all these wokeys who try to play that card against people like Musk, I'm afraid it's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=205.44s)]
*  all come back to haunt them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDw4k6NccFY&t=210.44s)]
