# 'SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY': Border expert issues warning over Venezuelan gang
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs)
*  Tomorrow, Texas Governor Abbott is scheduled to hold a press conference as a Venezuelan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=0.0s)]
*  street gang takes over a hotel in El Paso. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=5.76s)]
*  So this is the same gang whose members are accused of committing crimes in Colorado, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=9.24s)]
*  including in an apartment complex. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=13.8s)]
*  Lieutenant Christopher Oliveras is of the Texas Department of Public Safety joins us [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=16.72s)]
*  now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=21.04s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=22.04s)]
*  What do you make, I mean, how does this happen? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=23.64s)]
*  Just for viewers out there watching, how does a gang and why does a gang take over a hotel? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=25.18s)]
*  Well, good morning to the three of you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=30.92s)]
*  It's great to be with you, all three of you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  Of course, you know, for the viewers, one thing to understand is that this gang, of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=33.88s)]
*  course, all we're seeing right now on TV, what we've been seeing over the last two and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=36.88s)]
*  a half years, especially now with migrant crime, some of these crimes are being committed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=40.56s)]
*  throughout the country at the hands of illegal immigrants, could have clearly been prevented [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=44.08s)]
*  if for one, we had a secured border and policies that would have been enforced on day one, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=48.0s)]
*  as opposed to everything that was completely reversed by the current federal government. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=52.96s)]
*  That's why we're seeing this result of what's happening throughout the country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=57.44s)]
*  This is something that we have warned us as law enforcement that this was going to be [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=60.2s)]
*  a devastating impact. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  It was going to have a devastating impact when you allow tens and tens of thousands [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  and now even millions now of illegal immigrants unvetted released to the country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=69.0s)]
*  This is a result of that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=73.76s)]
*  And now trying to play clean up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=75.0s)]
*  And what I mean by that is trying to go back and now identify these individuals that are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=76.72s)]
*  in the country right now that do have criminal backgrounds that are committing crimes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  How do you get them removed and how you identify them? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=84.16s)]
*  Now you have this gang that before, you know, all we would talk about is MS-13. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=86.28s)]
*  This gang, Tenderagua, also known and also referred to as TDA, has grown so much, even [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=90.72s)]
*  more than them so than MS-13. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=96.12s)]
*  And they're not only, you know, taking over hotels, but these gangs are in line with the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=98.4s)]
*  Mexican drug cartels. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=102.48s)]
*  It has been confirmed that TDA is in line with the Sinaloa cartel, which is one of the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=103.48s)]
*  most powerful cartels in Mexico, and also the Juarez cartel, which operates directly [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=108.12s)]
*  across from El Paso. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=112.28s)]
*  This gang should not be taken lightly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=113.82s)]
*  And that's why Governor Abbott has a plan in place and he will announce that tomorrow [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=115.2s)]
*  and how we're going to, you know, how we're going to implement our efforts in Texas to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  go after this gang. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  Lieutenant, it's really important. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=124.56s)]
*  It's such an important topic. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  We know that this gang, as you said, is not only operating with the cartels, but they're [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=127.68s)]
*  deeply involved in child trafficking, in sex trafficking, in sex slavery of children. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=131.88s)]
*  This administration has lost 300,000 children, most of them Hispanics. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=138.32s)]
*  And I have been hearing more and more from Hispanic citizens that they are so angry [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=143.58s)]
*  that the Democrat Party has no compassion for these children. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=149.74s)]
*  They're angry. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=155.0s)]
*  They're saying those are Hispanic kids. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=156.0s)]
*  You know, they don't, Rachel, we've talked about this year over the years about unaccompanied [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  children how children are being exploited at the border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that it really is not being talked to, it's not being talked about so much. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=164.94s)]
*  But when you have a gang like this, TDA, that has been able to infiltrate the United States [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  and has been able to expand their criminal network throughout the United States, not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=173.22s)]
*  just in violent crimes such as assaults, assaults against law enforcement, kidnapping, smuggling, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=177.1s)]
*  murder, but now the exploitation of children. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=182.86s)]
*  That's why some of these hotels that are used, they're used for prostitution for sex crimes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=185.7s)]
*  That's why this gang should not be taken lightly. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=190.54s)]
*  And that's why, yet to date, we see what's happened over the last two and a half years, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=192.82s)]
*  the fact that we've had the most destructive situation on our border than we've ever experienced. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=196.88s)]
*  So now moving forward, what is the plan from the federal government to move forward? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=201.58s)]
*  How they're going to attack and go after this gang, TDA, because they haven't done so. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=204.9s)]
*  And they continue to release Venezuelans not only at ports of entry through the CBP-1 app, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=209.06s)]
*  but also direct flights from their home country and to the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=214.02s)]
*  So what are they doing to prevent this? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=217.76s)]
*  What are they doing to vet these individuals that they're releasing to the country? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=219.38s)]
*  Well, they're doing absolutely nothing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=222.5s)]
*  And now Texas law enforcement and other law enforcement agencies are having to identify [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=224.34s)]
*  these individuals and then try to, obviously, if they commit a crime, then we can prosecute them for a crime. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=229.22s)]
*  But other than that, we don't know how many right now are in the country right now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=235.62s)]
*  There's thousands. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=239.06s)]
*  Well, we showed a map while you were talking about where there's reported incidents is from Trinidad, Aragon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=240.06s)]
*  It's got Indianapolis, Indiana. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=244.22s)]
*  Everyone knows about Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Florida, New York. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=246.18s)]
*  So as you point out, we've become familiar with MS-13. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=250.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, now we have to become familiar with Trinidad, Aragon as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=253.94s)]
*  Lieutenant Oliveras, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=257.02s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=258.38s)]
*  Thank you, all three. Appreciate it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLPCn9eUNs&t=259.38s)]
