# Chinese nationals charged with smuggling 'devastating' biological pathogen into US
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA)
*  The FBI is sounding the alarm that our food supply is being targeted by the Chinese Communist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=0.0s)]
*  Party as two Chinese nationals have been charged with smuggling a potential agro-terrorism [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=5.68s)]
*  weapon into the U.S. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  This is really insane. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=12.72s)]
*  Lucas Thomason joins us live in Washington with the details. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=13.72s)]
*  Good morning, Lucas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=16.66s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=17.66s)]
*  A Chinese researcher at the University of Michigan and her boyfriend have been accused of smuggling [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=18.66s)]
*  a biological pathogen into the United States that can cause devastating diseases and crops [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=24.2s)]
*  FBI Director Cash Patel says, quote, This case is a sobering reminder that the Chinese [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=29.88s)]
*  Communist Party continues to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate our institutions [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=35.36s)]
*  and target our food supply, an act that could cripple our economy and endanger American [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=41.1s)]
*  lives. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  I commend the FBI Detroit Division and our partners at CBP for stopping this biological [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  threat before it could do real damage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=52.04s)]
*  Here's a photo of that fungus that was discovered at the Detroit airport in July. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  The small clumps of red plant material were discovered in these four plastic baggies tucked [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=59.48s)]
*  into a wad of tissues. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=64.72s)]
*  According to court documents, the 34-year-old Chinese boyfriend intentionally hid the samples [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=66.0s)]
*  in his backpack because he knew there were restrictions on importing them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  He had hoped to continue his research at the University of Michigan lab. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=75.88s)]
*  In a statement, the school says, quote, It is important to note that the university has [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=79.36s)]
*  received no funding from the Chinese government in relation to research conducted by the accused [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=83.84s)]
*  individuals. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=88.76s)]
*  We will have we have and will continue to cooperate with federal law enforcement in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=89.76s)]
*  its ongoing investigation and prosecution. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=93.92s)]
*  And in Arizona, the state's Democratic governor is under fire for vetoing legislation that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=97.32s)]
*  would have barred the Chinese government from owning land in the state. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=102.52s)]
*  Arizona is home to a number of military bases, including Luke Air Force Base, home to fighter [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=106.84s)]
*  squadrons, including the primary training center for the F-35 stealth fighter jet. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=111.16s)]
*  The Republican Senate majority leader in Arizona said, quote, It is utterly insane that Arizona's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=115.68s)]
*  top elected official would rather be an obstructionist against safeguarding our citizens from threats [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=121.2s)]
*  than sign legislation giving our state a fighting chance at proactively preventing attacks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=126.2s)]
*  Hobbs is a total disgrace. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=131.36s)]
*  As we just saw in Russia after Ukraine unleashed those drones against Russian air bases, destroying [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=133.72s)]
*  expensive bombers. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=138.12s)]
*  Military experts have long warned of China being able to do the same thing right here [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=139.4s)]
*  in the U.S., guys. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=143.68s)]
*  Hey, Lucas, do you know if President Trump has addressed this in executive orders with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=145.16s)]
*  the Chinese building, you know, buying land near military bases? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=149.12s)]
*  There's could that be handled from Washington and just just deny it? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=153.16s)]
*  Brian, there's talk that that's going to come in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=157.0s)]
*  And speaking to your last segment, there was also concern for years, of course, about Chinese [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=159.12s)]
*  nationals crossing the southern border in Arizona, of course, Southern California, home [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=163.68s)]
*  to U.S. military bases. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  So a big issue. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=169.84s)]
*  Lucas, you said that they found it in July. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=171.24s)]
*  Why are we just hearing about this? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=174.32s)]
*  It was just unsealed yesterday, Ainsley. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  That's how everybody knew. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=178.12s)]
*  Is there is it a reason why, Lucas, and you may not know this, forgive me. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=179.12s)]
*  Is it a reason why this was sealed? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=183.68s)]
*  Was it ruled under national security is why they sealed this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=185.84s)]
*  I mean, that's that's not typical for them to seal something of this magnitude. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=189.2s)]
*  This is a threat. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Lawrence, typically they're still investigating, so they're probably just following all the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  leads. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=198.28s)]
*  Roger that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=199.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=200.28s)]
*  Thank you, Lucas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=201.28s)]
*  A violation of the law and Cash Patel, who's head of the FBI, said the case. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=202.92s)]
*  No, what's Cash Patel's FBI FBI director case is sobering reminder that the Chinese [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=207.28s)]
*  Communist Party continues to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate our institutions [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=212.76s)]
*  and target our food supply and act that could cripple our economy and endanger American [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=218.02s)]
*  lives. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=223.2s)]
*  They say it's a fungus and they say that it's a fungus that causes head blight, a disease [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=224.2s)]
*  of wheat, barley, maize and rice and is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=228.58s)]
*  worldwide each year. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=233.94000000000003s)]
*  You mean a bio weapon from the Chinese? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  Have they ever done anything like that before? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=236.58s)]
*  Takes us back to Covid, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  And it just also plays into why we can have one hundred and fifty thousand Chinese students [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=240.74s)]
*  studying here, a lot of which are were party kids from party members. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  And if you come over and if you think, well, these are good kids or 18 years old, what [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=254.06s)]
*  harm are they? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=257.5s)]
*  As long as their families are back home, they're under obligation to spy for their country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=258.5s)]
*  And yet we're training. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=263.26s)]
*  We're training our enemy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=264.5s)]
*  It's a naive view to not believe that they would cause us harm. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=266.29999999999995s)]
*  And I also answer to your point about the FBI director. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=270.14s)]
*  He did the interview last week with Brett Baer and he said, what is the one thing that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=272.34s)]
*  keeps you up at night? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  He said the Chinese. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  He was probably talking about things just like this that we just learned. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn03LxkipdA&t=278.9s)]
