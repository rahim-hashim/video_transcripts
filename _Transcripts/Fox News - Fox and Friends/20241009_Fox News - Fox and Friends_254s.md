**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo)
*  This morning is millions flee Hurricane Milton in Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris wrapping up a softball media [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=3.04s)]
*  blitz here in New York City. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  Literally cracking jokes and cracking a beer [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=7.8s)]
*  with Stephen Colbert. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=9.6s)]
*  Would you like to have a beer with me [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=12.36s)]
*  so I can tell people what that's like? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=13.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=15.08s)]
*  This was, now we asked ahead of time [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=15.92s)]
*  because I can't just be giving a drink [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=19.64s)]
*  to the vice president of the United States. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=21.12s)]
*  But I'd ask you, you asked for Miller Highlight. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=22.84s)]
*  You really want a highlight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=24.96s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=27.26s)]
*  Okay, the last time I had beer was at a baseball game [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=29.3s)]
*  with Doug, so okay, cheers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=33.62s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=36.06s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=36.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=38.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=39.4s)]
*  That crowd roars, but is that the right move? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=42.5s)]
*  Here to react, former senior advisor to Tim Scott, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=44.86s)]
*  his presidential campaign, Matt Gorman. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  Matt, your reaction, your communications guy, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=49.54s)]
*  if that's your client, is that the move? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=52.22s)]
*  I mean, she wants to have her cake and eat it too. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=54.9s)]
*  She wants to go yuck it up with The View [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=57.1s)]
*  and Stephen Colbert, who are all openly supportive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=59.38s)]
*  And yet she also wants to insert herself with Ron DeSantis [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=62.06s)]
*  and try and play president. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=65.86s)]
*  And when she never has done this before, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=68.26s)]
*  and then criticize him when he won't go along with it, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=70.5s)]
*  you can't do both. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=72.62s)]
*  Either go and do these softball interviews [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=73.76s)]
*  or go pretend you're president [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=76.3s)]
*  at the White House with Joe Biden. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=77.9s)]
*  I mean, you have President Biden canceled his trip, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=79.3s)]
*  no Angola, no Germany, gotta stick around. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=81.64s)]
*  And he's praising governors for stepping up [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=84.38000000000001s)]
*  for a second major hurricane. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=87.10000000000001s)]
*  And she's going from Howard Stern to The View [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=88.66s)]
*  to Stephen Colbert's show after doing 60 Minutes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=90.9s)]
*  Remember, she wants people to have empathy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  and care about the American people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=96.54s)]
*  Tell me if this show, remember these accusations [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=98.14s)]
*  and then keep in mind what you just did having a beer, watch. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=100.98s)]
*  What just upsets me so is the idea that any politician [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  would play political games with these folks [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=111.9s)]
*  with people who are in the midst of such suffering, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=115.18s)]
*  loss of life, loss of their homes, loss of normalcy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  And then for the sake of political gain, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  tell these lies in a way that is meant [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  to make people distrust the help [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  that is there for them to receive. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=129.8s)]
*  And it's crude, have you no empathy, man. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=131.46s)]
*  If you watch what happened in the western part [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=138.8s)]
*  of North Carolina, if you saw the special operations [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=142.26s)]
*  and all the groups that had to go in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=145.54s)]
*  because FEMA wasn't there, if you saw the civilian choppers [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=146.82s)]
*  and taking 10 days to call the army in, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=150.34s)]
*  you don't think you're open to criticism for that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=153.12s)]
*  And how does Stephen Colbert, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=155.82s)]
*  even he's always a comedian, not know that? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you wanna talk about empathy too. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=160.82s)]
*  Where was she when this was barreling down [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=162.62s)]
*  on those folks in North Carolina and Georgia? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  She was in the West Coast with celebrities raising money. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=166.54s)]
*  And Joe Biden was in Rehoboth, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  and didn't go back to the White House. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=171.66s)]
*  And again, she's up in New York. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=172.78s)]
*  And again, what is all, talking about empathy, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=174.82s)]
*  what about the empathy for a governor [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=176.78s)]
*  who's staring down a cat five in the face, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=179.06s)]
*  trying to protect his residence and his state, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=181.26s)]
*  and then going out and calling him selfish [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=183.94s)]
*  because he won't indulge your little campaign stunt? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=185.62s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=188.52s)]
*  And Matt, you just, you did tell our producers, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=189.46s)]
*  you see a huge problem between Biden passive aggressive [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  against the vice president. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=195.06s)]
*  And when he praised DeSantis yesterday in the Oval Office, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  that was more evidence of it, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=199.5s)]
*  calling a press conference in the middle of her event. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=200.62s)]
*  That was more evidence of it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=202.78s)]
*  And the fact that she says, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  she was there with me every step of the way, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  is that more evidence? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=207.8s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=209.24s)]
*  You've seen this over the last week or so, you're right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=210.08s)]
*  Going out right when she's about to start her event, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=211.86s)]
*  then just really giving her a big bear hug, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=214.18s)]
*  that unpopular president saying, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=216.62s)]
*  she's a major player in everything I've done. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=218.1s)]
*  And then also, yeah, you're right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=220.38s)]
*  Yesterday, he just threw under the bus [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=221.58s)]
*  and debunked what she was saying, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=223.5s)]
*  going over the top saying how communicative [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=225.34s)]
*  and cooperative DeSantis was. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=227.66s)]
*  We're all working together, he's doing a good job. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=229.66s)]
*  When he did not have to do that, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=231.94s)]
*  I can imagine the White House was getting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=233.86s)]
*  a pretty angry call from the Harris campaign [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=235.74s)]
*  when they heard that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=237.38s)]
*  Yeah, I hope they work it out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=238.3s)]
*  I'm gonna say, I hope everybody gets along. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=240.34s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=243.4s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo&t=244.24s)]
