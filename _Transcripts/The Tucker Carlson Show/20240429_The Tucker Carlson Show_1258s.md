# Klaus Schwab, Transgenderism, and AI | Russian Philosopher Aleksandr Dugin
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o)
*  Alexander Dugin is a 62-year-old Russian academic philosopher. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=0.0s)]
*  He spent his life in Moscow. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=6.32s)]
*  He was an anti-Soviet dissident as a young man. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=8.28s)]
*  And now he is famous the world over, in the English language press anyway, as, quote, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=11.58s)]
*  Putin's brain. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=16.2s)]
*  But he is not a political figure here in Russia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  He is once again a philosopher. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=19.78s)]
*  And his ideas are deeply offensive to some people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=22.92s)]
*  In August of 2022, his only daughter was murdered in Moscow when a car bomb killed her. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=26.92s)]
*  U.S. intelligence says she was murdered by the Ukrainian government, and we take that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  at face value. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=37.92s)]
*  But what's interesting is that once again, Alexander Dugin is not a military leader. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=39.6s)]
*  He's not a close daily advisor to Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=43.8s)]
*  He is a writer who writes about big ideas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=48.36s)]
*  And for this, his books have been banned by the Biden administration in the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  You cannot buy them on Amazon, banning books in the United States because the ideas inside [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=56.64s)]
*  are too dangerous. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  He is often described, again, in the English language press as far right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  We'll let you assess. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=66.2s)]
*  But we wanted to talk to him about some of his ideas, these ideas that are so dangerous [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  that his only daughter was murdered over them and his books been banned in the United States. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=72.28s)]
*  And so we're happy to have him join us now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=76.08s)]
*  Mr. Dugin, thank you very much. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for inviting me and welcome to Moscow. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=83.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=84.44s)]
*  So we were talking off camera, actually we were having a conversation that we were not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=85.44s)]
*  going to film, just interested to meet you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  But what you said was so interesting that we got a couple of cameras and put this together. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=90.8s)]
*  And my question to you was, what do you think is happening in the English language countries? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=95.28s)]
*  And I said, all of them, United States, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, all [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=99.48s)]
*  at once decided to turn, seemed to turn against themselves. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=104.12s)]
*  You know, this great turmoil and some of the behaviors seem very self-destructive. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=107.68s)]
*  And where do you think as an observer that comes from? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=112.72s)]
*  So I could just suggest express my reading of that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=116.32s)]
*  It demands a little patience. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=124.2s)]
*  So I think that everything started with individualism. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=125.96s)]
*  So individualism, that was wrong understanding of the human nature, of the nature of man. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=131.62s)]
*  When you identify individualism with the man, with the human nature, you cut all the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=139.24s)]
*  relations to everything else. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=147.96s)]
*  So you have very special idea of the subject, philosophical subject as individual. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=150.9s)]
*  And everything started in the Anglo-Saxon world with Protestant reform and with nominalism. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=157.24s)]
*  Before that nominalist attitude that there are no ideas, only things, only individual [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=165.46s)]
*  things. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  So individual, it was the key and is still key concept that was put in the center of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  liberal ideology and liberalism as in my reading, it is a kind of historical and cultural and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=179.78s)]
*  political and philosophical process of liberation of individual of any kind of collective identity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=188.54s)]
*  Collective or that transcend, transcends individual. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=197.54s)]
*  And that started with refuse of Catholic Church as collective identity, of empire, Western [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  empire as collective identity. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=214.78s)]
*  After that it was revolt against a national state as collective identity in favor of purely [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=217.34s)]
*  civil society. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=224.18s)]
*  After that, there was a big fight of the 20th century between liberalism, communism and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=225.9s)]
*  fascism and liberalism has won once more. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=232.54s)]
*  And after the fall of the Soviet Union, there was only liberalism. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=236.78s)]
*  And Francis Fukuyama has pointed out correctly that there are no more any ideologies except [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=240.54s)]
*  of liberalism. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=247.54s)]
*  And liberalism, that was liberation of this individual from any kind of collective identity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=248.54s)]
*  There were only two collective identities to liberate from. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=256.09999999999997s)]
*  Gender identity, because it is collective identity, you are man or woman collectively, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=262.94s)]
*  you could be alone. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  So liberation from gender and that has led to transgenders, to LGBT and new form of sexual [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=271.1s)]
*  individualism. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=282.1s)]
*  So sex is something optional. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=283.1s)]
*  And that was not just deviation of liberalism, that was necessary elements of implementation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=287.98s)]
*  and the victory of this liberal ideology. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=297.86s)]
*  And the last step that is not yet totally made is liberation from human identity, humanity [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=300.06s)]
*  optional. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=308.34s)]
*  And now we are choosing, or you in the West, you are choosing the sex you want as you want. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=309.62s)]
*  And the last step in this process of liberalism, implementation of liberalism will mean precisely [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=316.94s)]
*  the human optional. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=325.78s)]
*  So you can choose your individual identity to be human, not to be human. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=328.18s)]
*  That has a name, transhumanism, posthumanism, singularity, artificial intelligence, Klaus [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=333.58s)]
*  Schwab, Kurzweil or Harari. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=342.78s)]
*  They openly declare that is inevitable future of humanity. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=346.06s)]
*  So we arrive to the historical terminal station that we finally five centuries ago we have [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=351.22s)]
*  embarked in this train and now we are arriving at the last station. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=361.22s)]
*  So that is my reading. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=365.66s)]
*  And when all the elements, all the phases of that, you cut the tradition with the past. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  So you are no more Protestant, you are secular atheist, materialist, you are no more national [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=376.98s)]
*  state that served the liberal to liberate from empire. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=382.86s)]
*  And now national state becomes at its turn obstacle. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=386.90000000000003s)]
*  You are liberating from national state. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=392.94s)]
*  Finally family is destroyed in favor of this individualism. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  And the last thing, the sex that is already almost overcome, sex optional and in gender [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=401.62s)]
*  politics there is only one step to arrive to the end of this process of liberation, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=409.02s)]
*  of liberalism. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=416.82s)]
*  That is the abandoned human identity as something prescribed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=418.06s)]
*  So to be free from, to be human, to have the possibility to choose to be or not to be human. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=422.67999999999995s)]
*  And that is the agenda, political, ideological agenda of tomorrow. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=430.62s)]
*  That is why, how I see Anglo-Saxon world that you have asked of. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=436.86s)]
*  I think that is just avant-garde, one word of this process because that started with [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=443.78000000000003s)]
*  Anglo-Saxon's imperialism, nominalism, Protestantism. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=452.22s)]
*  And now you are ahead as Anglo-Saxon, more devoted to liberalism than any other European. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=458.82s)]
*  So what you're describing is clearly happening and it's horrifying. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=467.1s)]
*  But it's not the definition of liberalism I have in mind when I describe myself as what [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=472.62s)]
*  we say in the United States as a classical liberal. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=477.22s)]
*  So you think of liberalism as individual freedom and choice from slavery. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=480.3s)]
*  So the options as we conceive them as I was growing up were the individual who can follow [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=489.38s)]
*  his conscience, say what he thinks, defend himself against the state versus the statism, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=494.86s)]
*  the totalitarianism embodied in the government that you fought against, the Soviet government. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=501.54s)]
*  And I think most Americans think of it that way. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=507.29999999999995s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=511.62s)]
*  Very interesting question. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=515.02s)]
*  I think that the problem is in two definitions of liberalism. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=517.22s)]
*  There is old liberalism, classical liberalism, and new liberalism. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=523.14s)]
*  So classical liberalism was in favor of democracy, democracy understood as the power of majority [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=528.14s)]
*  of consensus of individual freedom that should be combined somehow with the freedom of other. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=534.26s)]
*  And now we have totally the next station already, the next phase, new liberalism. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=542.26s)]
*  Now it is not about the rule of majority, but it is about the rule of minorities. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=549.18s)]
*  It is not about individual freedom, but it is about walkies. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=554.9399999999999s)]
*  So you should be so individualistic that you should criticize not only the state, but the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=560.58s)]
*  old understanding of individuals. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=570.38s)]
*  So now you are invited to liberate yourself from individuality, to go further in that direction. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=573.1800000000001s)]
*  So I have spoken once with Fukuyama, Francis Fukuyama on TV, and he has said before, the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  democracy has meant the rule of majority, and now it is about the rule of minorities [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=590.7800000000001s)]
*  against majority, because majority could choose Hitler or Putin. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  So we need to be very careful with majority, and majority should be taken under control. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=603.6600000000001s)]
*  And minorities should rule over majority. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=610.5400000000001s)]
*  It is not democracy, it is already totalitarianism, and now we are not about the defense of the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=615.14s)]
*  individual freedom, but about prescription to be woke, to be modern, to be progressive. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=621.1s)]
*  It is not your right to be or not to be progressive. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=628.1s)]
*  It is your duty to be progressive, to follow this agenda. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=633.46s)]
*  So you are free to be left liberal. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=637.62s)]
*  You are no more free enough to be right liberal. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  You should be left liberal. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=646.5s)]
*  And that is a kind of duty, it is prescription. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=649.5s)]
*  So liberalism fought during its history against any kind of prescription, and now at its turn [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=652.42s)]
*  became totalitarian, prescriptive, not free as it was in some... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=663.02s)]
*  And do you believe that was inevitable, that process, that was always going to happen? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=672.02s)]
*  I think that is... [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=677.02s)]
*  I perceive here a kind of logic, so a kind of logic that is not just perversion or deviation. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=678.02s)]
*  You start with one thing, you want to liberate individual, when you arrive at the point when [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=685.9s)]
*  it is possible, it is realized, so you need to go further. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=693.8599999999999s)]
*  And you start to liberate yourselves from, this time from old understanding of individual [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=700.9399999999999s)]
*  in favor of more progressive concept. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=709.18s)]
*  So you could not stop here. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=714.02s)]
*  That is my vision. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=715.46s)]
*  So if you say, oh, I prefer old liberalism, they would say, the progressives, they would [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=717.1s)]
*  say it is not about old liberalism, it is about fascism. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=722.9s)]
*  You are defender of traditionalism, conservatism, fascism, so stop here. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=726.74s)]
*  Either be progressive liberal or you are done, or we will cancel you. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=732.02s)]
*  That is what we observe. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=737.46s)]
*  Well, it is certainly what we are living and to see self-described liberals ban your book, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=739.5s)]
*  which is not a manual for bomb making or invading Ukraine, these are philosophical works, tells [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=747.5s)]
*  you that it is not, of course, it is not liberal in any sense. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=757.2199999999999s)]
*  I wonder though, when you reach the point when the individual can no longer liberate [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=760.8199999999999s)]
*  himself from anything when he is just not even human, what is the next step after that? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=767.3s)]
*  That is described in the pictures, American pictures, films in many ways. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=774.38s)]
*  So I think that you know that all the science fiction almost all of the 19th century were [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=781.3s)]
*  realized upon in the reality in the 20s. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=788.58s)]
*  So there is nothing more realistic than science fiction. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=791.14s)]
*  And if you consider Matrix or Terminator, you have so many more or less coinciding versions [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=796.14s)]
*  of the future, the future with the post-human or human optional situation or artificial intelligence. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=805.02s)]
*  You know, Hollywood has made many, many, many films. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=813.42s)]
*  I think they portray correctly the reality of the close future. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=818.02s)]
*  So for example, if we consider the man, the human nature as a kind of rational animals. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=825.46s)]
*  So you could now with our technology, you could produce them. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=835.7800000000001s)]
*  So you could create rational animals or combine them or construct them. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=840.14s)]
*  And artificial intelligence, strong artificial intelligence, neural network plus huge database. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=848.54s)]
*  It is a kind of king of the world, I would say that could not only manipulate but create [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=857.66s)]
*  realities because the realities are just images, just sensations, just feelings. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=865.74s)]
*  So I think that post-humanist futurism is a kind of not only a realistical description [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=873.5799999999999s)]
*  of the very possible and probable future, but as well a kind of political manifest. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  So it is not that this kind of visual thinking and the fact that you have no bright traditional [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=888.3399999999999s)]
*  future described in the films. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=897.0999999999999s)]
*  I don't know any movie of the future in the West made about return to traditional life, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=899.66s)]
*  the prosperity, the families with many children. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=907.94s)]
*  Everything is quite in the shadow, quite black. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=912.1800000000001s)]
*  So if you're used to paint everything black and the future especially, so this black future [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=918.82s)]
*  arrives and I think that is the same fact that we have no other option, either matrix [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=929.4599999999999s)]
*  or artificial intelligence or something or a terminator. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=938.42s)]
*  So the choice is already outside of the limits of humanity and that is not just fantasy, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=945.18s)]
*  that is a kind of political project and it is easily imagined because we have seen the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=955.62s)]
*  films, they follow more or less close to this progressive, I would say, agenda. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=964.82s)]
*  So I've asked you no questions about Russia or Russian politics and I'm not going to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=973.86s)]
*  because I think it's so interesting to see your perspective on countries that you don't [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=979.46s)]
*  live in because we do gain insight, I think, from the view of outsiders. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=985.38s)]
*  My last question to you is how do you explain this phenomenon I have noticed where for over [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=990.0600000000001s)]
*  70 years a group of people in the West and the United States, liberals, effectively defended [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=995.5400000000001s)]
*  the Soviet system and Stalinism and many participated, personally participated in Stalinism, spied [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1002.74s)]
*  for Stalin, supported him in our media. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1008.78s)]
*  In the year 2000, and they loved Boris Yeltsin because he was drunk, but in the year 2000 [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1012.0999999999999s)]
*  leadership of this country changed and Russia became their main enemy. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1018.06s)]
*  So after 80 odd years of defending Russia, they hated Russia, what was that? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1021.9399999999999s)]
*  Why the change? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1029.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that, first of all, Putin is traditional leader. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1031.06s)]
*  So Putin, when he came to power, from the very beginning, he started to extract our [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1037.46s)]
*  country, Russia, from the global influence. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1050.1799999999998s)]
*  So he started to contradict to global progressist agenda. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1052.82s)]
*  And these people who supported Soviet Union, they were progressists. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1058.3s)]
*  And they are now progressists. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1063.38s)]
*  So they have felt that now they are dealing, they were dealing with someone who doesn't [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1065.3s)]
*  share this progressist agenda and who tried and with success to restore traditional values, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1072.5s)]
*  sovereignty of the state, Christianity, traditional family. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1085.86s)]
*  That wasn't evident from the beginning, from outside. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1091.74s)]
*  But when Putin insisted more and more on this traditional agenda, I would say, on the particularity [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1095.18s)]
*  and speciality of the Russian civilization as some special type of world vision that [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1104.02s)]
*  had and has now very little similarities with the progressist, the progressist ideals. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1112.34s)]
*  So I think that they have discovered, they have identified in Putin precisely what Putin [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1123.9s)]
*  is. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1130.46s)]
*  He is a kind of leader, political leader, defending traditional values. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1131.9s)]
*  So only recently, one year ago, Putin has made decree of the political defense of traditional [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1137.78s)]
*  values. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1147.3s)]
*  That was turning point, I would say. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1148.3s)]
*  But observers from the progressive camp in the West, I think they have understood that [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1150.06s)]
*  from the beginning of his rule, correctly, correctly. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1160.98s)]
*  So this hatred is not just casual, something casual or some mood. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1163.54s)]
*  It is not casual. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1169.8600000000001s)]
*  It's very serious. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1170.8600000000001s)]
*  It's not casual. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1171.8600000000001s)]
*  It's very serious. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1172.8600000000001s)]
*  It's metaphysical. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1173.8600000000001s)]
*  So if your main task and main goal is to destroy traditional values, traditional family, traditional [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  states, traditional relations, traditional beliefs, and someone with the nuclear weapon, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1182.06s)]
*  that is not smallest, the last but not least argument. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1188.94s)]
*  Someone with nuclear weapon stands strong defending traditional values. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1196.1000000000001s)]
*  You are going to abolish. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1202.22s)]
*  I think they have some basis for this Russophobia and the hatred for Putin. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1203.8600000000001s)]
*  So it is not just by the chance. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1212.0800000000002s)]
*  It's not some irrational, irrational change from Sovietophilia to Russia phobia. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1215.1799999999998s)]
*  It's something deeper, I would say. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1224.6599999999999s)]
*  It's my guess. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1226.3s)]
*  It's clearly something. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1227.58s)]
*  It's clearly something deeper. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1229.02s)]
*  We felt it was important for your ideas to get an airing in English in the United States [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1231.4199999999998s)]
*  simply because we believe in the open airing of ideas. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1235.1399999999999s)]
*  I guess we're liberals that way. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1238.1s)]
*  So we're grateful that you took the time. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1239.98s)]
*  Vazhduin, thanks. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1241.6999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1243.6599999999999s)]
*  Free speech is bigger than any one person or any one organization. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1245.1s)]
*  Societies are defined by what they will not permit. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIULmTprQ6o&t=1252.06s)]
