**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E)
*  Life is long and weird and the longer it is the weirder it gets you may have noticed that but even by that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=0.0s)]
*  Unchanging standard Gina crono has had a pretty [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=6.48s)]
*  Remarkable life packed into a relatively short amount of time. So in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=9.92s)]
*  2006 she began as a professional mixed martial arts fighter [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  It's a few years. She was starring in big Hollywood films like Fast and Furious [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=20.68s)]
*  Then in 2019 not that long ago. She got one of the biggest roles for career [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=25.04s)]
*  She was on a Disney show called The Mandalorian in case you didn't see it. Here she is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=29.4s)]
*  Stay back dropper easy drop your weapon. You're gonna wish you never left Alderaan. I [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Saw your planet destroyed I [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Was on the Death Star [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=47.2s)]
*  Which one? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=49.2s)]
*  You think you're funny [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=51.84s)]
*  Do you know how many millions were killed on those bases? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=53.72s)]
*  Drop your boss as the galaxy cheered [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=58.2s)]
*  last chance [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=61.44s)]
*  Destroying your planet was a small price to pay to rid the galaxy of terrorism [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=62.6s)]
*  So back in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=76.72s)]
*  2019 when you worked at Disney the Disney corporation you could expect a long and pretty stable career [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=77.88s)]
*  It's a huge company lots of things you could keep doing there at a pretty good salary [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=83.24s)]
*  And the only cost would be you have to follow the rules Disney at the time was getting increasingly [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  Political and the people who worked there were expected to go along with this don't say anything and you'll be absolutely fine [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=93.8s)]
*  but for some reason [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=99.52s)]
*  She could not follow that rule [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=101.16s)]
*  And so she went on Twitter and pushed back on some of the things that Disney was pushing she questioned [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=103.16s)]
*  The motives of Black Lives Matter if it's so great. Why isn't helping black people? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=108.8s)]
*  She asked about the 2020 election. Was it really fair and then [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=112.72s)]
*  She suggested maybe vax mandates were not a good idea. So what do you think happened? Well Disney fired her [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=117.16s)]
*  What happened next to Gina Chrono? It's an even more interesting story than the first part of her life [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  And so we're honored to have her join us on set now, Gina. Thanks so much. Thank you Tucker. It's so good [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  It's great to see you. So last we spoke and I don't know because both of our lives have taken lots of turns since yeah [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=134.8s)]
*  I can't remember how long it's been [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=140.24s)]
*  But you were just kind of emerging from the chaos of getting fired for things that in a normal country would not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=143.84s)]
*  Cause you to be fired [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  Like refusing to put in a pretty funny way your your pronouns in your email and they fired you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=152.8s)]
*  so [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  What happened like what are the twists that your life has taken since because I think it tells us a lot. Well, we [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=160.44s)]
*  went to the Daily Wire [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  after the cancellation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=169.68s)]
*  Daily Wire in Nashville. Yes, and why'd you go there? What was your expectation? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  Because Ben Shapiro had given me the opportunity to you know [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Kind of try to uncancel me. Yes. Hey, we'll do a movie with you. Come on out and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's just do a movie and try to get you know, be uncancelled [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=186.24s)]
*  Yes, and so I went out to Nashville thinking that we were gonna shoot a movie there. We didn't shoot it there [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=189.6s)]
*  We ended up shooting up in Montana, Prey, Montana [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=194.16s)]
*  What a great town that yeah. Oh, yeah, I love Montana. Yeah, and so we we shot this two million dollar [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=197.44s)]
*  Western movie during like, you know the time where SAG-AFTRA was starting to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=206.32s)]
*  Mandate the vaccines and COVID tests and masks and you know [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=211.28s)]
*  I just said to the Daily Wire gave me the you know, the option, you know [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=216.28s)]
*  We can either do a union movie or we can do a non-union movie [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=220.64s)]
*  What would be the difference? The difference would be [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=224.16s)]
*  Well, the difference would be we would have to basically [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Hire more vaccinated people on the union movie just in case they did mandate it which they ended up mandating it [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=232.32s)]
*  Which is obviously everything I was standing against and so that wasn't an option for me [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=238.96s)]
*  But it was an option for the Daily Wire [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=243.36s)]
*  It was one of their options. Yes. Yeah, and so then their second option was well for half the money [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=245.36s)]
*  So we went from four million dollar, you know [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=253.68s)]
*  exciting serial killer movie to a two million dollar [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=256.64s)]
*  Non-union movie where that would have given [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=261.44s)]
*  You know so many more people that were struggling at the time for not taking the Vax for not wanting to apply by the COVID [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=264.32s)]
*  Restrictions and so the Daily Wire did put that on my you know [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=271.04s)]
*  My shoulders and said, you know, this is your decision. This is your movie [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=276.16s)]
*  And I chose to go up and shoot the two million dollar Western which was called terror on the prairie [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=280.24s)]
*  So half the budget but you felt that it was important as a matter of principle not to participate in the vaccine [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=286.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't gonna do that. I mean, you know Disney [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=292.0s)]
*  Didn't I mean I wasn't I didn't cave to Disney, you know what I mean? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=296.4s)]
*  I'm not gonna like go to Nashville and be like, okay [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=299.84s)]
*  I was so grateful by the way for the opportunity, you know that they offered me [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=302.72s)]
*  But it just when I got there. It was just two different [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=308.8s)]
*  Options that I would I thought I didn't think that that was what I was showing up to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=313.12s)]
*  But they they did you know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=317.12s)]
*  They were like, okay, then let's let's go up and let's make this western for two million dollars [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=320.16s)]
*  It made it definitely a lot more difficult [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=325.04s)]
*  It's kind of funny online and on IMDB [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=328.24s)]
*  They say it's we shot it for 75 million dollars and they're trying they're trying to like write up all these reports that it went into theater [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  And it only made eight hundred dollars and I'm like no it actually was just [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=337.68s)]
*  Streamed on the daily wire. We made it for about two million dollars that I know of you know, and it could have been less than that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=342.08s)]
*  And we uh, it was never in theater and you've got like all of the hollywood, you know [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=349.28s)]
*  Press like look at you know, and it's even not not I believe it's still on imdb listed as a 75 million dollars just to kind of like [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=354.88s)]
*  Do these awful things to people like of course me [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=362.4s)]
*  You know, it's like a lot of people are like, oh my god, I'm gonna do this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=365.84s)]
*  Do these awful things to people like of course me and the daily wire and like people like you it's like let's just put as [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=369.04s)]
*  Much false information that leads people astray [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  Um, but I ended up being a really good film. Um terror on the prairie. I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=379.44s)]
*  I think there could have been you know adjustments made that made it better, but I'm I love the performances in it [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=384.48s)]
*  I love the people that made it. Um, dallas sonier is a wonderful producer. I loved working with him [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  And so I had a you know, a really good time [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  So what'd you do after that? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=400.0s)]
*  I [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=401.84000000000003s)]

*  So when you when you were fired from disney for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=488.72s)]
*  Reasons that no person should ever be fired [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=492.32000000000005s)]
*  Resisting a vax mandate or not putting your totally insane pronouns in a in an email [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=495.28000000000003s)]

*  For not telling your story more completely for those who don't know it. It's not simply that they fired you right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=524.32s)]
*  It's that they defamed you they I mean and harassed and discriminated and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=529.36s)]
*  Just put me through the struggle session, which I didn't know when you're going through it [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=535.84s)]
*  You don't know that you know, you're like I was so naive at 2020 [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=540.08s)]

*  You know hustle for that next job, you know that next action job or the next drama job [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=549.9200000000001s)]

*  And so then it was just like when 2020 hits like the the shades got opened and I started actually like looking around thinking [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=560.4s)]
*  Wait a second. Wait a second. What's happening here? Like, yeah [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  Uh, why are people allowed to riot on the streets and they're not allowed to go to church? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=571.92s)]
*  And why are big businesses staying open? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=576.72s)]
*  And small businesses are getting shut down [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=579.52s)]
*  and um [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=581.84s)]
*  You know, it was just uh, it bothered me [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=582.96s)]
*  It's like people forcing masks on each other and I and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=585.36s)]
*  And you know interesting intrinsically new lockdowns are going to be devastating to people. This is you know [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=590.08s)]
*  Coming from a person who has you know, been on and off work [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=596.24s)]
*  I know what it's like to not work for a year and work for three years and not to work [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=600.24s)]
*  When you take away that consistency [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=604.32s)]
*  It does such an emotional mental spiritual thing on you that um, you know, some people don't know how to handle [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, they start drugs alcohol addiction and that's exactly what we've seen [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=612.8s)]
*  You know, we've seen all of this addiction and all this problem [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=618.0s)]
*  Um, you know deaths and i've lost two friends to overdoses [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=621.92s)]
*  um [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=628.0s)]
*  You know one to turbo cancer [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  I've lost so i've lost so many people in the last six years or the last four years that it's just like mind-blowing which is just a whole [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  another subject, but it it does make me feel like um [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=638.4s)]
*  I was I stood up for the right thing. I'm not sorry. I did it hasn't made things easy [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  but um [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=648.96s)]
*  Yeah, I was uh, so I did try to go and talk to a lawyer [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=650.32s)]
*  And what was the lawyer's response and what was your thinking about it at the time? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=655.2s)]
*  You know like I had to get out of la because my life was not safe there [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=659.44s)]
*  at least where I was at and you know, it's pretty expensive to live in la and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=663.6s)]
*  and so it's either like [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=667.44s)]
*  Moving to keep keep in la or [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=669.28s)]
*  You know try to move to maybe nashville and see if that the daily wire thing works out [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, that didn't really you know pan out which you know, it's not like there's no bad blood there [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=677.12s)]
*  It's just it's not where I you know, it's not where god wanted me. I don't think yes [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=682.4s)]
*  um [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=686.4s)]
*  And so then I just kept on going and I ended up in montana [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=687.52s)]
*  And wind up in montana. We ended up shooting terror on the prairie there [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=691.52s)]
*  And you liked it so much you stayed I [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=695.76s)]
*  just being outside and looking at the sky and being able to breathe and not feeling that anxiety of a city or [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=698.08s)]
*  um [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=705.92s)]
*  the possible riots coming down the streets and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=706.88s)]
*  Just you know, there's an interesting thing. I feel like in montana, uh, you know people mind their business basically [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=710.32s)]
*  Yes, and keep to themselves and um [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=716.64s)]
*  I feel like in montana you have to work in your land. You have to be have a certain toughness during the winter [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=720.0s)]
*  And I think that's really cool. So, you know montana is not a place where weak people go to live [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=726.4s)]
*  And I like to be surrounded by by that energy [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=732.24s)]
*  By strong people. Yeah [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  And so when I me and my lawyer were talking about it my family lawyer, he's such a wonderful man. He was like jeena [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=737.6s)]
*  You know, I think it's important that you get somewhere safe and take care of that first [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=743.76s)]
*  And so I did and and relocating your life as i'm sure you've been through plenty of times in your life is you know [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=748.96s)]
*  It's not like an easy thing [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=755.52s)]
*  Changing a job changing of a life perspective. Yeah, you know and then having to completely uproot and move your life and figure out [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=757.92s)]
*  Where you belong? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=766.0s)]
*  Yeah, all of that has been going on in the last two years and a lot of positive things too [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=767.36s)]
*  um, I look at you know, uh [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=773.2s)]
*  Relationships and friendships and future different, um, you know, I could have ended up in new york and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=776.78s)]
*  Single at some point and now I really value a partnership and I really value [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=784.16s)]
*  A future with someone and it's just like my whole [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=789.68s)]
*  Maybe that's just called maturity, but I was a really late in [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=793.36s)]
*  Maturity part you were my little sister. You're busy [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=797.36s)]
*  My little sister was a lot more mature than me and she's got three kids and she's like any day jeena any day [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  i'm like well [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=807.12s)]
*  You know, I don't know about the kids part, but did your spiritual perspective change? Oh it [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=808.48s)]
*  I've always been a christian [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=814.48s)]
*  But I never felt so much like a christian as I do [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=816.88s)]
*  these last few years and it just keeps growing and um [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=821.12s)]
*  you know, I think that's something that makes people cringe and uh, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=825.76s)]
*  I've seen that happen, but why does it make people cringe when you say that? Well, I think you know [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=829.36s)]
*  Religion and any type of you know, it's been used so wrongly, you know [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=835.18s)]
*  It's been used so aggressively and wrongly to persuade people in evil [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=840.64s)]
*  you know ways that are fake and [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  um [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=848.64s)]
*  It's it's it's really turned people off because usually when people go to god or go to a place of god [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=849.6s)]
*  They're searching because they're hurt and they're wounded and when you are hurt and wounded and then you get hurt and wounded by the person [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=855.44s)]
*  The people are a place that you feel is supposed to protect. Yes, be the safe place. I think then [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  Then people just get really [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=868.88s)]
*  um angry at god [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=870.96s)]
*  And I don't think that it's god that maybe they're angry at it's at the experience, you know [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=873.28s)]
*  Yeah, so the people claiming to represent him. Yeah, so I really haven't been to church an actual church [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=878.32s)]
*  Probably in 20 years [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=884.88s)]
*  But I in the last three years have just grown so much closer and understanding and so it was actually at that point [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=888.88s)]
*  Where I said, you know, I was like god [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=898.0s)]
*  You know all these people are getting justice, you know, and I I was so I know I was done so wrong [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=902.88s)]
*  It was so wrong what happened to me [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=908.48s)]
*  And I know that there's so much more wrong that happened to so many other people and so [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=910.64s)]
*  I even felt like you know [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=915.28s)]
*  Don't be a brat about this, you know, like there's you know doctors and lawyers and police officers and nurses and [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=917.2s)]
*  you know, this is like awful things are happening all around to everybody and so I just [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=925.12s)]
*  I started looking at my justice as you know, it was starting over in montana and [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=931.28s)]
*  Being able to see the big sky and just being so grateful for my surroundings and then finally [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  It was really interesting when I finally [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=942.4s)]
*  Got that out of my heart [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=945.04s)]
*  And truly gave it over to god and was just like it's yours [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=946.96s)]
*  If I stay in the desert of work and I never work again [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=950.96s)]
*  in this business then okay, then [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=955.12s)]
*  I need to learn a different skill [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, I need to figure out what i'm gonna do and so I had to really let it go [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  Genuinely, you know genuinely let it go and it wasn't easy and a week later. Well, yeah that took years [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=966.88s)]
*  um, I tried to I tried to pretend like I was there so many times but to genuinely let that last inch of like [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=973.6s)]
*  It's gonna be okay and i'm gonna give it to you [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=982.4000000000001s)]

*  On the biggest level, I mean if we did not have what elon musk is doing right now [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1364.3s)]

*  such a tough [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1438.8600000000001s)]
*  Moment in time that I think that he will go down in history as one of the greats [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1440.38s)]
*  Um as will you tuck her? Well, i'm not i'm not doing anything like that. I'm just talking on camera [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1446.22s)]

*  And we basically think that she's denigrating people off of their cultural and religious beliefs and they said something out about me being abhorrent [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1706.7s)]
*  And for your anti-nazi tweet. Yeah. Yeah [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1714.54s)]

*  You obviously know this since you worked in the business, but I mean [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1719.26s)]
*  People who write about television and movies are directed [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1722.62s)]
*  to the word [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1726.78s)]
*  By the pr departments at the television and movie companies, right? So there's no independent [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1728.54s)]
*  Press that writes about the movies or about television, right? Even cable news [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1734.1399999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? Yeah, like the big cable news websites are all controlled by the pr departments [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1738.7s)]
*  Right, it's true in hollywood and that's really been uh, you know, so I had my own [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1744.46s)]
*  Um had hired my own publicist during you know, season two of the mandalorian and they were working with the [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1749.66s)]
*  publicists from the disney people and then they were working with the uta who dropped me immediately as well [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1757.0s)]
*  Of course they do. Uh-huh. And then your agent who's there fighting for you. Yeah [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1763.02s)]

*  I think was uh [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1777.42s)]
*  They would constantly be sending out. Hey, we're having this democrat, you know, um at my house [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1779.1s)]
*  Come on over for you know, raise some funds for the democrat, you know party da da da or whoever the candidate was that they were [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1783.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, and so all of these people just dropped me immediately and I was like people you'd been paying [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1790.2199999999998s)]
*  To stand by your side in case there was a big problem. Yeah, the second there was a big problem. They fled and denounced you. Yes [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1796.4599999999998s)]
*  Immediately may they all rot [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1802.9199999999998s)]
*  Uh, and and I was just like, okay [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1805.48s)]
*  That's so much, you know, I mean I knew that like maybe something could happen where disney would might be like hey, you know, um [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1811.0s)]
*  As professionals I thought maybe they just be okay. Well, maybe we're gonna [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1819.3200000000002s)]
*  Not work with you or maybe something like that could happen by speaking out [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1823.5600000000002s)]
*  Um about the things that I spoke out about but I found the things that I spoke out about were so much more important than [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1827.8000000000002s)]
*  The the career part because I felt like you know, we needed to be talking about we're headed in a really bad direction [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1833.24s)]
*  Oh, yes, you know the lockdowns the mask mandates the vaccines, you know, I felt like we needed to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1840.28s)]
*  um [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1846.2s)]
*  I never even said who I was really voting for it was just I was getting really pushed into this like you're an extremist [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1847.48s)]
*  You're an all-right extremist, you know [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1852.68s)]
*  um, and so I thought maybe that that could be an option [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1855.0s)]
*  But never in my wildest dreams what I thought that they would have through [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1859.1599999999999s)]
*  Twitter or through a publication without even calling me [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1864.1999999999998s)]
*  This is how I found out I was fired [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1869.32s)]
*  online on twitter [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1872.12s)]
*  Like they didn't call me. They didn't say we're letting you go. We're not we're no longer going to work together [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1874.76s)]
*  um, this is why [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1880.76s)]
*  you know, it was just um [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1882.84s)]
*  She's denigrating people off of cultural and religious beliefs and she's abhorrent [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1885.56s)]
*  For coming out against the nazis. Yeah. Yeah [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1890.1999999999998s)]
*  So backwards [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1895.8s)]
*  Yeah, and but again, you know that when you get attacked in the hollywood trade press [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1898.76s)]
*  That's because the company you worked for directed those reporters to write and i'm learning that more and more so now [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1905.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know when there's like a a piece [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1911.6399999999999s)]
*  That somebody writes about me. Um, I go and I look up the journalist and then I go and look up what other [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1914.76s)]
*  You know [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1921.56s)]
*  What I what other you know articles has this journalist written? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1922.4399999999998s)]
*  Of course and you can almost just trace it back and a couple I traced I traced right back to lucas foam [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1925.24s)]
*  and I was like, of course, you know right there you guys you know, you call up your people and uh, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1931.32s)]
*  You know, it's ugly it's the most dishonest thing ever [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1936.52s)]
*  Yeah, and a reporter at the hollywood reporter or wherever. Yeah, and and it's all involved right? It's the agencies. It's the managers. It's [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1940.52s)]
*  the um [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1948.84s)]
*  Publicists it's the studios and it's just this big mafioso [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1950.92s)]
*  That um does not give the independent artist unless they're willing to comply and fit in [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1955.08s)]
*  100 percent [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1961.8799999999999s)]
*  into that [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1963.32s)]
*  Ideologies and their narratives and be basically these manufactured robots, you know [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1964.44s)]
*  I mean, I feel like there's the one percent of hollywood that can do what they want and say and think what they want [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1971.24s)]
*  And those are the very very talented people [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1976.52s)]
*  um, but at the peak of my career it was like [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1979.48s)]
*  You know, I think they thought let's make an example out of this one for sure. Um, she's an action actress [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1982.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, she hasn't done, you know drama yet. She hasn't gotten there. Um, we'll make an example out of her [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1988.2s)]
*  and uh, it had the complete opposite effect [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1994.6000000000001s)]
*  which was um, just [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=1997.96s)]
*  overwhelming support, um [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2000.5800000000002s)]
*  Uh, it was pretty funny like as soon as they [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2003.88s)]
*  They were at the peak of their um stock market [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2007.72s)]
*  ever [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2011.56s)]
*  In february 2021 or no. Yeah in february 2021 [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2013.0800000000002s)]
*  And right when they fired me is when it started plummeting [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2016.92s)]
*  To what it is now [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2021.3200000000002s)]
*  And you know, they're you're obviously very smart people and they're trying to salvage it but um [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2023.72s)]
*  people saw [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2028.9199999999998s)]
*  They saw what was going on [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2030.52s)]
*  In my case, it was very obvious. Do your friends were still there? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2032.52s)]
*  Yeah, I you know everybody I worked physically with um, I never had a problem with and uh, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2036.6799999999998s)]

*  You know me and page are reconnected after um, you know carl weathers passed away. Yes, um [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2046.2s)]
*  and [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2053.88s)]
*  You know, there's all these lies and all these weird stories in that people make [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2055.0800000000004s)]
*  Up in their heads and you know, one thing I can say is, you know, I adore paedro [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2060.52s)]
*  um, and he said one thing to me he said you and carl were protectors [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2066.84s)]
*  and [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2073.4s)]
*  and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2075.0s)]
*  That means so much to me that he remembers me and our time together as me being a protector and [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2076.44s)]
*  um [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2083.0s)]
*  it's important like [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2084.12s)]
*  Like people don't know what the real story is like. Why do you think paedro's calling me a protector? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2086.8399999999997s)]
*  To his fans. I want I I you know, there's a reason and there's stories that you don't know [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2093.56s)]
*  That happened [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  And I was there and I and I protect people, you know, like [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2101.3999999999996s)]
*  Uh, there was a person [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2106.52s)]
*  Multiple times that's just my nature is when you know, there was a person who was wearing a mask on set [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2108.84s)]
*  And they were at their end [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2114.7599999999998s)]
*  They were overtime [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2117.16s)]
*  And they were crying and they were upset and they couldn't do it anymore. They just couldn't they were broken [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2119.24s)]
*  There was a broken person in that mask and I [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2126.2s)]
*  Nobody was saying anything [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2129.88s)]
*  And I just simply went up to the director at the time and I said this person's done [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2131.88s)]
*  They're done they need that they're they need their um [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2136.52s)]

*  and um [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2148.1200000000003s)]
*  The director and I was like look I you know [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2149.48s)]
*  And I worked long longer hours than maybe probably any actor because my face was showing and I did all my own stunts [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2152.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you go back and you look at like the work records [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2158.92s)]
*  You're gonna find who was on set the most as like the actors and you're gonna find me at the top of that list [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2161.48s)]

*  You know because I do understand that like well I come from a fighter's background [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJaP_-em2E&t=2190.36s)]
