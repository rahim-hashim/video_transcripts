# Tucker and Steve Bannon Respond to Israel’s War on Iran and How It Could Destroy MAGA Forever
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM)
*  Donald J. Trump gets elected in November on the back of this amazing coalition, unprecedented [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=0.0s)]
*  coalition, different parts of American society. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=6.44s)]
*  You never thought of anything in common. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=8.28s)]
*  Trump paints a picture that makes it really obvious that the old structure, left versus [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=10.42s)]
*  right, Democrat versus Republican, is basically BS and a control device, I think. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=16.72s)]
*  This is my interpretation anyway. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=21.22s)]
*  So he creates this brand new coalition. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=22.96s)]
*  New York Times writes almost nothing about it because it's such a massive threat. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=24.82s)]
*  But this coalition, which you described earlier and more precisely than anybody by far, is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=28.16s)]
*  the defining fact of American politics. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=36.12s)]
*  And it kind of feels like it's being blown up over this war in Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=39.0s)]
*  That's my observation, correctly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=44.84s)]
*  Andy Sperling Well, I think if you look at the three planks, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=45.84s)]
*  no forever, stop the forever wars, seal the border and deport the illegal alien invaders. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  And redo the commercial relationships in the world around trade deals and bring high value [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  added manufacturing jobs back here, they're trying to shut all three down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=63.12s)]
*  But the one that they're obsessed with the most, which I find strange, is the forever [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=69.0s)]
*  wars. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=75.36s)]
*  They've got to be in the forever wars, and particularly in the Middle East. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=76.36s)]
*  This is what, and I'm a big supporter of Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=78.56s)]
*  And I'm telling people, hey, if we get sucked into this war, which inexorably looks like [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=81.56s)]
*  it's going to happen on the combat side, it's going to not just blow up the coalition, it's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=87.2s)]
*  also going to thwart what we're doing with the most important thing, which is the deportation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=91.84s)]
*  of the illegal alien invaders that are here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=96.64s)]
*  If we don't do that, we don't have a country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=99.04s)]
*  And you just see right now, they're doubling, tripling out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  This is actually potentially a real civil war in our biggest cities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=103.94s)]
*  And President Trump has to have our backing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=108.0s)]
*  This came out of nowhere. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=110.52s)]
*  The trade deals you saw, he put together the Liberation Day, but they've been thinking [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=112.56s)]
*  about it a long time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=116.08s)]
*  I mean, Trump's been talking about this since Lou Dobbs back in the 90s. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=117.08s)]
*  He lays that out there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=119.96s)]
*  It's very sophisticated. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=120.96s)]
*  He's got Scott Besant running around with Lutnik. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=122.12s)]
*  They're trying to make these deals. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=124.32s)]
*  He sealed the border already in the first 60 days. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=127.0s)]
*  Now we're really going down and actually having the deportation, see the fight. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=129.52s)]
*  And then out of nowhere comes a war with Persia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=133.52s)]
*  It's like a shooting war with Persia, a massive shooting war with Persia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=137.7s)]
*  It's like, how did this happen? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  And that's why I've been up as a defender of Israel and someone that's very pro-Israel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=142.48s)]
*  I've been saying, hey, this is going to be the end of Israel because of the way these [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=146.78s)]
*  decisions have been made. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=150.0s)]
*  And you have, I think, shockingly today, early when we had you on the show, you bring up [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=151.38s)]
*  a point that we have to address, which I think it's the thing itself. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  What is it about this apparatus? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  You have a coalition that's like 1932 that's coming together, like Roosevelt had Harvard [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=165.12s)]
*  professors and crackers and Democrats and ranchers out west and big city bosses and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=169.96s)]
*  the Irish and the Italians. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=176.52s)]
*  And he put it all together and they juggled it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=177.52s)]
*  Brooklyn, Butte, Montana, Birmingham, Alabama, and they're all on the same side. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=179.8s)]
*  Look, how did that happen? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=183.24s)]
*  And they govern literally almost all the way to Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=184.24s)]
*  Reagan took out part of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=187.44s)]
*  Newt Gingrich took out part of it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=188.52s)]
*  But it was 50, 60, 70 years. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=189.82s)]
*  We have the same ability. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=191.88s)]
*  We have hardscrabble Hispanics on the rear of Grand Valley, South Texas. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=193.48s)]
*  We have tech bros. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=197.84s)]
*  We have economic nationalists. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  We have economic populists. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  We have people that want to stop their forever wars. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=204.04s)]
*  There's three planks. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=205.92s)]
*  And right at the beginning of it, and it's on the 10th anniversary of coming down to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=206.92s)]
*  Golden Escalator. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  That was 10 years ago, Sunday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=212.26s)]
*  And I tell people as many triumphs and tragedies, victories and defeats, good days and horrible [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  days when we're winning and sometimes we're losing those 10 years of everything that's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=219.68s)]
*  gone on. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=224.72s)]
*  It's just the preamble for where we are today on the convergence of these crises. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=225.72s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, a shooting war where they're taking the Nimitz battle group out [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=230.96s)]
*  of the South China Sea and sending three carrier battle groups now to the North Arabian Sea, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  Red Sea, plus Arleigh Burke destroyers and a whole fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=241.32s)]
*  We're prepping for a major shooting war. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=246.88s)]
*  How did it happen? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  I think what's most shocking is what you said. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Hey, it was like Iraq. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=251.52s)]
*  You're inexorably just drawn and decisions kind of just happen. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=253.08s)]
*  It's like what's happened over the last 72 hours? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=256.64s)]
*  How do we even get to this point? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=258.36s)]
*  How did this actually happen? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=259.94s)]
*  Who made these decisions when we had the intel out there that this was not like a thing? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=261.12s)]
*  This was something that was going to happen a year or two from now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=266.14s)]
*  Bibi admitted to breadbear on Sunday night. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=269.24s)]
*  The question before us is not simply the Israel-Persia situation, is what the fuck is going on in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=272.6s)]
*  this city that just drives this city, whether you're Barack Obama or Donald Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=279.6s)]
*  And if we don't sort it out now, I mean right now, that's what we have to have a throwdown. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=283.8s)]
*  We have to name names. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=288.62s)]
*  We have to expose it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=289.72s)]
*  If we don't throw it out now, throw down now in the summer of 2025, we're not going to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=290.88s)]
*  have a country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  Forget the midterms. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=296.56s)]
*  Forget the next election still. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=297.56s)]
*  We have to have this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  What happened in Ukraine? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=300.64s)]
*  What the CIA has done? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=303.06s)]
*  What DNI is doing? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=304.62s)]
*  What the Justice Department? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  What the FBI, what DIA and the Pentagon? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  Because right now, we only have a tenuous grip on those. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=310.8s)]
*  We have two people at the FBI, Cash and Bongino. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=313.56s)]
*  We got a handful of people over at the Justice Department in a massive 30-some person or [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=317.32s)]
*  15,000, 20,000 person operation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=321.96s)]
*  We have three or four people at DNI with 17 agencies. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=324.41999999999996s)]
*  We're putting a couple of people in there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=328.32s)]
*  At the Pentagon, we got Pete and a handful of guys. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=329.92s)]
*  Every time a guy steps up or the team steps up to say they want to stop the forever wars, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=333.36s)]
*  they're turfed out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=337.56s)]
*  He's lost 10 people since we've even got there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=338.56s)]
*  Every time Bridge Colby tries to do something, Bridge Colby is on the front page that he's [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=341.48s)]
*  an appeaser. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=346.32s)]
*  My point is that now we're getting down to it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=347.64s)]
*  With all these converging crises, we have a apparatus that reports to Wall Street, to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  foreign investors, to Silicon Valley, in business with the Chinese Communist Party that's running [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=359.0s)]
*  the deal. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=364.18s)]
*  Now's the time we got ... If we don't lance the bull over this, this country, you're not [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=365.18s)]
*  going to ... If you can't turn around with Trump, the Trump team he has, people like [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=369.84s)]
*  you, myself, and they're blessed to have these apparatuses, if we can't do this now, it's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=374.4s)]
*  not going to get done. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=379.47999999999996s)]
*  That's why, to me, it's gone. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=380.94s)]
*  Of everything we're doing, stopping the forever wars, redoing the commercial relationship [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  trying to bring jobs back, and sealing the border and sending home the deporting 10 million, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  which is going to be massive, almost like a civil war in these big cities. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  Of all of those, and I've always said the deportation is the most, to get our sovereignty [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=395.68s)]

*  I think we've looked away too often. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=406.32s)]
*  We just kind of kicking the can down the road, and if we can't do it now with Trump, it's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=410.67999999999995s)]

*  It does feel like Fox News is playing, and I never criticized Fox because they were so [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=415.68s)]
*  kind to me, but they are playing a central role in the propaganda operation here, it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=422.48s)]

*  Let's go back to the Iraq war. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=430.04s)]
*  You were there, you saw it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=433.64000000000004s)]

*  I promoted the Iraq war. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  When knowingly, because of the information you were giving, knowingly what they did, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=436.64000000000004s)]

*  They're not successful. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  They're unsuccessful. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=445.04s)]
*  They can't be successful because, as Lincoln told us, what you need is popular opinion [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=446.04s)]
*  to have your back, and we don't do enough about educating the American people on what [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=451.08s)]
*  reality is. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=454.96s)]
*  In fact, they give them the exact opposite. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=455.96s)]
*  The rise of Trump is from two things. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=459.52s)]
*  The rise of Trump is from the failed Iraq war and from the 2008 financial collapse. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=461.2s)]
*  You had Buchanan before that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=467.28s)]
*  We had Perot before that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=468.52s)]
*  We had even Reagan from some populism national. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=469.64s)]
*  You had these sprouts. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=472.36s)]
*  You could see people were trying to get there, but they couldn't. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  It was those two cataclysmic events, an epic failed war, that we were lied to about everything, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  the reason we went in. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=483.72s)]
*  Remember, first the American people supported it, given the information they were given. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=484.72s)]
*  Then later, they realized that, hey, not just with the initial predicate for this lie, all [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=488.68s)]
*  the updates were kind of a lie. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  All the updates were a lie. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=496.2s)]
*  We really weren't winning until we sent General Kelly to the Anbar province to be the tough [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=497.2s)]
*  as tribe. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=502.28s)]
*  It took forever. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  What, 8,000 dead, 50,000 wounded, $9 trillion, or $7 trillion in Iraq and $2 trillion in Afghanistan? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  You're just lied about the entire time. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=514.16s)]
*  That's what's happening here. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=515.92s)]
*  We're not being dealt with straight. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=517.4s)]
*  I'm just saying on the information that's put out, the Israeli position on this has [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=518.6s)]
*  changed three or four times. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=522.76s)]
*  First it was the nuclear bomb, the processing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=525.52s)]
*  There was going to be something like last weekend. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=529.56s)]
*  You had to go now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=531.2s)]
*  You had to go on Thursday night. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=532.6400000000001s)]
*  It had to happen. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=534.08s)]
*  Then we find out it's a year away at earliest, and then it's a decapitation strike. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  They're trying to have regime change. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=541.72s)]
*  That just kind of came up over the weekend and saying, oh, well, since they're there, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=543.0s)]
*  we have to do it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=546.32s)]
*  Understand they said this is unilateral, we're doing our own, but understanding that they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  needed American air assets on the defense to protect themselves. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  This is why the early Burke were rushed in, and this is why American air defense assets [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=558.24s)]
*  have been used nonstop. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  Now they're talking about, oh, by the way, we really can't take out Fodor. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  We can't take out the hidden mountainous. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=566.44s)]
*  Second part of this, we need American combat sorties. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=570.2s)]
*  We need American tankers to refuel us. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=573.22s)]
*  We need the bunker busting bombs, and we need assets. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=575.22s)]
*  This thing changes all the time. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=578.88s)]
*  When Tulsi Gavrid's still out there, as the last thing publicly said by a senior intelligence [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=580.32s)]
*  official, she said in March, they don't have a program. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=584.9200000000001s)]
*  They haven't had a program. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=589.48s)]
*  That's what Bret Baier asked Bibi on Sunday night, and Bibi said, well, we have new information, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=590.96s)]
*  new intelligence. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=597.5600000000001s)]

*  We were told that we gave you exquisite intelligence. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  You weren't giving us intelligence. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=601.64s)]
*  We have to have a total vetting. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=603.4200000000001s)]
*  By the way, we need to get a vetting on Ukraine. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=604.96s)]
*  We need to get a vetting on, was American intelligence involved? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=607.8000000000001s)]
*  Because it's a zero probability that without our satellites, without targeting the information, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=612.32s)]
*  without fire control information, there's no chance that the Ukrainians, as courageous [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=617.2s)]
*  as they are, as much valor as they have, could have pulled out something so complicated. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=622.4000000000001s)]
*  This is right now the fight. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=628.72s)]
*  The fight has to be we have to take on the deep state. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=629.84s)]
*  We have to name names, and we have to basically take these organizations and take them apart. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=633.12s)]
*  Then you're going to unmask everybody in DC that's not really on your side. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=638.6800000000001s)]

*  When they start protecting this, you're going to say, well, hang on for a second. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=646.64s)]
*  This doesn't mean we're a constitutional republic. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=650.12s)]
*  Trump's commander in chief, this is what a constitutional republic's about. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=652.6s)]
*  I don't care if AOC is the president later on or Bernie Sanders or JD Vance or another [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=655.88s)]

*  It doesn't care whether it's progressive like Barack Obama or an economic populist [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=670.88s)]
*  nationalist like Donald Trump. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=676.4s)]

*  If you go back from September 1939, the invasion, the start of the European war, not the Asian, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=826.4799999999999s)]
*  but if you start with the invasion of Poland by the Germans and you go to June of 1941, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=831.52s)]
*  of Russia by the Wehrmacht, and you look at that time, which really they called the Phony [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=839.36s)]
*  War, you look at the casualties from the Battle of Britain, the Blitz, the fall of France, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=842.52s)]
*  you look at what happened in North Africa early on, Finland, throwing 300,000 Finland, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=847.52s)]
*  you add it all up. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not half of what's happened between Ukraine and Gaza today and now in Persia. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=853.72s)]
*  We are much bloodier. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=860.44s)]
*  This is a much, we're in a shooting part of the third World War. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=861.6s)]
*  The third world is not about to start. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=865.16s)]
*  It has started. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=866.88s)]
*  And that's what Trump is saying. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=868.08s)]
*  What he wants to do is have everybody lay their guns down. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=869.64s)]
*  Let's get to the table and figure out a tenuous, at least subtle piece that we then use capital [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=872.38s)]
*  and trade and commerce and try to rebuild these countries and let's get people back to work [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=880.12s)]
*  and maybe tamp this thing down. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=885.2800000000001s)]
*  Whereas the apparatus is exacerbating the conflict part of it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=887.64s)]
*  That's where we are right now in the summer of 2025. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=892.36s)]
*  This thing is going to be in the next 200 days, the next 200 days are some of the most [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=895.3599999999999s)]
*  perilous times for the American Republic in its history because if we don't get this sorted, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  we're going to be drawn in totally into a conflict as a combatant, as not a supplier [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=906.0799999999999s)]
*  of logistics or as an actual combatant, a participant in the situation in Ukraine, what [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=910.54s)]
*  they did in Russia, in the situation of what Israel is right now doing to the Mullahs as [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=915.76s)]
*  bad as they are and as evil as they are. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=921.4s)]
*  We're going to get sucked into a shooting war of which it'll be 10 years and the casualties [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=924.12s)]
*  will dwarf anything you saw in World War II. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=929.08s)]
*  One of the lessons that we never talk about from World War II since you evoke the comparison [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=931.72s)]
*  is that the second the shooting war started in Great Britain and the United States, opponents [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=936.08s)]
*  of the war went to jail and Winston Churchill's entire political opposition went to jail with [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=940.4s)]
*  their wives, with their wives for the duration of the war and some of them died. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=944.88s)]
*  That's been completely, it's just a fact. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=949.96s)]
*  You can call those people whatever you want and they may have been terrible people, whatever, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=951.36s)]
*  but they were his political opponents and he put them in jail. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=954.24s)]
*  And Roosevelt did, you know, sick the federal government on opponents of the war, flat out. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=957.4000000000001s)]
*  So if... [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=962.72s)]
*  And Lincoln did the same thing. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=963.72s)]
*  And Lincoln did the same thing. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=964.72s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=965.72s)]
*  I love Lincoln. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=966.72s)]
*  And in areas that we control in the Revolutionary War, which not a lot of the same thing happened, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=967.72s)]
*  that's called war. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=972.2800000000001s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=973.2800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=974.2800000000001s)]
*  Opponents of war are invariably described as allies of the enemy and they're persecuted. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=975.28s)]
*  Do you worry about that happening to you? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=983.36s)]
*  You just said on camera, I don't want this war, but we're moving toward a third world [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=984.68s)]
*  war. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=988.36s)]
*  Well, I saw a... [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=989.36s)]
*  Look... [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=990.36s)]
*  Are you worried about going back to jail? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=991.36s)]
*  I went to prison on a misdemeanor, but it was kind of one of the same things. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=992.36s)]
*  I wouldn't testify, I wouldn't turn... [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=995.64s)]
*  Because I said this committee is not legitimate, doesn't have a ranking member, doesn't have [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=998.12s)]
*  counsel, is totally legitimate. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1002.32s)]
*  Plus, he's got executive privilege. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1003.32s)]
*  That's good enough for me. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1006.1600000000001s)]
*  And if I have to fight this, and I think it's going to go to the Supreme Court, although [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1007.1600000000001s)]
*  I've served my prison sentence, I'm taking it up to the Supreme Court because I had a [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1010.0s)]
*  pretty good ruling, not terrible, from the appeals court. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  A couple of the judges are making arguments about why I should take it further. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1018.0400000000001s)]
*  It's definitely going to happen. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1021.7600000000001s)]
*  Look what's happening to you. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1022.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've known you for a long time. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  And I sit down and look at what they're saying about Tucker. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1025.44s)]
*  I said, what is Tucker saying so bad? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1027.48s)]
*  Kind of laying out these arguments that ought to be debated right now in the halls. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1030.36s)]
*  I feel pretty moderate. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  Tom Cotton's coming out and saying, all these influencers and podcasters are... [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, let's have a debate. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1039.0s)]
*  When we had a debate about the Ukraine, about the funny Ukraine in the Senate, we beat them. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1040.0s)]
*  This is why Mitch McConnell had to resign. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1043.9599999999998s)]
*  Because why? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1047.56s)]
*  Because the podcasters and influencers are much closer to the MAGA base and can deliver [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  the heat into the House and the Senate. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1053.9599999999998s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1056.36s)]
*  I'm all for having a War Powers Act debate right now. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1057.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1060.04s)]
*  I agree. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1061.04s)]
*  Let's have the American people weigh in because you're going to see the American people are [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1062.04s)]
*  90% against forever wars. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1064.6799999999998s)]
*  And even people that support Israel are saying exactly what we're doing here. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1067.96s)]
*  We thought we had this thing in Gaza. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1071.52s)]
*  You had to clean up with the Muslim Brotherhood in Hamas. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1072.52s)]
*  Next thing you know, we're bombing Tehran and you're taking income. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1075.8799999999999s)]
*  What's happened in Tel Aviv over the last 24 hours is pretty shocking because you're [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1081.28s)]
*  taking these ballistic missiles. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1085.28s)]
*  What's Trump's been saying? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1086.68s)]
*  Everybody calm down. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1088.24s)]
*  Let's get back to the table. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1089.52s)]
*  I can get actual thing. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1090.6s)]
*  He said, I can get it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1091.8s)]
*  We can take it apart. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1092.8s)]
*  We can blow it up if we want to. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  But I can cut a deal. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1095.48s)]
*  And Witkoff and Trump, if you got to talk about two deal makers that are not like diplomats [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1096.48s)]
*  but guys actually going to get stuff done, I feel more confidence with Steve Witkoff [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1101.72s)]
*  and Donald Trump trying to work something out than continue on the shooting war where, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1106.28s)]
*  with a carrier battle group heading over there and all these tankers heading over to the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1112.04s)]
*  Middle East, we are prepping right now to come in on the offensive side of combat stories. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1117.72s)]
*  And that's a game changer. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1124.0s)]
*  As bad as it is now that we're a combatant, because we are a combatant, which I say, if [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1125.28s)]
*  they're unilateral, why do we get sucked in here? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1129.32s)]
*  Where is that decision? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1131.36s)]
*  Where you said, hey, Steve, decisions just get made. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1132.36s)]
*  You never know how they get made. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1134.68s)]
*  They're organic. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1135.8s)]
*  There's never a moment where we stop and we say, do we want to be involved in another [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1136.8s)]
*  Middle Eastern war? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1139.94s)]
*  You just wind up there, just like everything in life. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1141.28s)]
*  You're just like, how did I get here? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1143.28s)]
*  But I think that's why they're attacking you, because you're saying, hang on a second. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1144.72s)]
*  Let's have a national discussion on this right now before we get in. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1148.02s)]
*  And they don't want that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1150.52s)]
*  But why the viciousness? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1151.52s)]
*  Not toward me. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1152.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm kind of punched out of society. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1153.52s)]
*  But like, why is it this topic evokes a cruelty and a dishonesty that no other topic does? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1155.4s)]
*  There's never been question like this. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1164.2s)]
*  There's never been question out in the open. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1166.24s)]
*  I've never had this debate that you've kind of led for the last couple of months, and [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1169.2s)]
*  now we're actually having this debate. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1172.8400000000001s)]
*  They've never had people in government like Tulsi Gabbard, like Bridge Colby, like others. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1174.72s)]
*  And look, I don't think Bridge is hard enough in the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  But his book was amazing. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1184.5600000000002s)]
*  And he's got the pivot to Asia, which we have to get to. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1186.1200000000001s)]
*  People want to see how the institutions and apparatuses work. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1188.64s)]
*  And this is why the Democrats are all institutionalists now, right? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1192.24s)]
*  We're the anti-institutional guys because you see how corrupt they are. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1195.64s)]
*  You need not look further than CENTCOM. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1199.64s)]
*  One of the problems we have is that Obama tried it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1202.5600000000002s)]
*  Obama put his whole presidency on the Nationalist Curious Side. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1206.0400000000002s)]
*  We're going to pivot out of Asia. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1209.3600000000001s)]

*  You look back and you feel like, oh, there was something really important about that, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1234.76s)]
*  knowing the person who cut your meat. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1238.8400000000001s)]

*  The third fleet to the seventh fleet all takes place in Hawaii, the Hawaiian operator. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1349.0s)]
*  You do like three or four days of work up because they have a certain different lingo [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1352.72s)]
*  and a different tempo. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  So you got to get to how they do it. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1357.5600000000002s)]
*  We get called in in the middle of night on the red phone. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1359.5600000000002s)]

*  We're Pearl Harbor as a sea detail is almost impossible to do because it's so narrow, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1364.6s)]
*  And Honolulu is up there. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1369.32s)]
*  So it's not like World War II. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1370.32s)]
*  It's very dangerous. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1371.44s)]
*  We go in there and we hear the hostages have been taken. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1372.6s)]
*  And now all of our assets in Korea, in the South China Sea, and in Japan are heading [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1375.6799999999998s)]
*  towards the North Arabian Sea, which the United States Navy had never been at. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1381.28s)]
*  We had a couple of white painted destroyers in Bahrain, but we were not used to that. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1385.28s)]
*  So they go, we follow a carrier all the way to Korea because you had to be, we were a [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1390.84s)]
*  gas turbine. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1395.32s)]
*  We were the only ones who could keep over the carrier. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1396.32s)]
*  Thirty-five knots for like two weeks. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1397.76s)]
*  Damn. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  We destroyed the ship. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1401.3999999999999s)]
*  We destroyed the sonar dome because you go through a typhoon, you go through some heavy [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1402.3999999999999s)]
*  weather. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1405.72s)]
*  Because we had a treaty at the time with Korea, we would keep a carrier battle group within [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1406.72s)]
*  a 24-hour strike of North Korea. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1411.1999999999998s)]
*  So we have to get there. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1413.3s)]
*  Once we get there, they peel us off. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1414.3s)]
*  And our squadron of ships, the famous destroyer squadron 23, Arleigh Burke's Little Beavers, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1417.5s)]
*  we go to the North Arabian Sea. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1421.62s)]
*  Why they're working up for, and that is like a host, I tell people, if you haven't been [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1424.54s)]
*  off the coast of Iran or Persia, as I call it, it's like the landscape of the moon. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1428.34s)]
*  This is the most inhospitable place on earth. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1433.58s)]
*  The Straits of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf, the North Arabian Sea. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1438.26s)]
*  And our carrier battle group stayed. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1442.02s)]
*  We rotated out after about four months. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1443.42s)]
*  The people stayed and eventually, a couple months later, actually did the failed rescue. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1445.98s)]
*  We practiced every day. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1451.9s)]
*  You could see every day they had the lift capacity, the helicopters were practicing. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1453.38s)]
*  We were actually going to do plain guard against potential Russian fighters in the Persian [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1458.06s)]
*  Gulf, put the radars up, because nobody knew what was going to happen. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1462.14s)]
*  It was a failed effort. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1465.5s)]
*  But I tell people, and it turns out the Nimitz is now about to be decommissioned. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1466.7s)]
*  This may be their last cruise. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1471.54s)]
*  They were there 50 years ago. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1473.26s)]
*  Is the first time they really got commissioned. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1475.7s)]
*  Their first assignment was in Gonzo and Camel Station in the North Arabian Sea. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1477.64s)]
*  These are big decisions the Pentagon makes. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1483.34s)]
*  Particularly today, when they decide to take a carrier battle group, strike group, away [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1486.18s)]
*  from the South China Sea in the defense of Taiwan, given how on pins and needles we are [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1490.26s)]
*  there, because the Chinese Communist Party are not doing exercises. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1494.66s)]
*  They're doing rehearsals for an invasion. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1498.18s)]
*  To take that out and to take it to the North Arabian Sea is signaling to the world that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1500.42s)]
*  we're about to do something. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1505.9s)]
*  That's what's so scary right now. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1507.46s)]
*  When you get to your theory that these decisions, you're just getting inexorably drawn in. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1508.94s)]
*  Now we have all of our basically air assets that are ready to launch combat sorties on [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1514.42s)]
*  Tehran and whatever else happens. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1521.26s)]
*  They're in place. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1524.3000000000002s)]
*  It's not like you make a decision while it takes us a week to get there. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1525.66s)]
*  They're in place. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1528.8200000000002s)]
*  The fighters are over there. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1530.22s)]
*  We can do in-tank refueling. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1531.22s)]
*  I think in the next 24 to 48 hours, a decision could be made. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1532.22s)]
*  That's why I'm getting more and more vocal, not less vocal, that we need to go full stop [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1536.8999999999999s)]
*  right now. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1541.46s)]
*  We need to find out, because there's too many moving pieces. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1542.46s)]
*  Moving pieces about exactly what's going on, what's the risk. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1544.6599999999999s)]
*  We haven't had a full debate about this. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1548.5s)]

*  Number one, we had no involvement at all in the Ukraine assault under Russia. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1572.4199999999998s)]

*  And then he ought to be open to questions. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1580.5s)]
*  He's never criticized. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1581.6599999999999s)]

*  We don't have 10 political pointies, which we should have. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1602.38s)]
*  We got two guys running that building. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1604.76s)]
*  That's the way the agency's structured. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1607.18s)]
*  There's no civilian control of the CIA. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1608.54s)]
*  Well, you know better than anybody, but it runs the way it's going to run. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1610.78s)]
*  We sent Pompeo over there. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1616.82s)]
*  It's an army. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1618.18s)]
*  It's a business. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1619.18s)]
*  It's a government agency. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1620.18s)]
*  It's a country. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1621.18s)]
*  It's a venture capital firm. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1622.18s)]
*  It's literally a venture capital firm, and its budget is unknown. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1623.6399999999999s)]
*  Its reach is... [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1628.26s)]
*  And we have no idea what they're doing. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1630.26s)]
*  Of course, because the majority of things that they do are not US government employees [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1631.26s)]
*  doing, even the door kickers. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1635.46s)]
*  No, they're working through some exile group. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1636.78s)]
*  They've been funding for 30 years, right? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1639.22s)]
*  They will also look you right in the eye and lie to you, because that's the willingness [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1641.1000000000001s)]
*  of mirrors, right? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1646.22s)]
*  Look, look. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1647.22s)]
*  And they're smart. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1648.22s)]
*  Somebody said to me the other day, someone knowledgeable said, the problem with the US [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1649.22s)]
*  government is like, why can't we do this or that? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1652.8600000000001s)]
*  If you wanted light rail, you know we couldn't do it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1654.54s)]
*  And this person said, because all the smartest people in government are at CIA? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1657.26s)]
*  They also, with the interagency process, they control the entire process. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1661.8600000000001s)]
*  This is why downsizing NSC was so important. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1665.46s)]
*  When you have this, we had these detailees that come from all the different departments, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1667.82s)]
*  because NSC should have 30 people, but it had 250. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1671.98s)]
*  They're 60 political appointees, right? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1675.3s)]
*  And there's 280 come from different agencies to do all the different paperwork. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1678.26s)]
*  They have the interagency process. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1681.74s)]
*  The CIA controls that process. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1683.74s)]
*  They control the process at the Pentagon. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1685.74s)]
*  They control the DHS. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1687.3799999999999s)]
*  They control over the Justice Department. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1688.82s)]
*  They are embedded deep, because they've been around so long, and they know how to embed [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1690.72s)]
*  the smartest people out there. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1696.62s)]
*  So if you don't get control of that, you're not going to get control. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1697.82s)]
*  They're like a Peturian Guard right now. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1701.46s)]
*  We have to lance this. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1704.34s)]
*  This is like the late stage of the Roman Empire, when the Peturian Guard kind of ran the deal, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1705.34s)]
*  and they would put forward every legionary captain that they thought was going to be [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1710.3799999999999s)]
*  good for a time. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1714.26s)]
*  And they are planning right now to thwart President Trump's second term, make sure they [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1715.26s)]
*  wait him out, and they're going to have a hand-selected person for the third term. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1721.54s)]
*  And I don't say this as a conspiracy theory guy. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1724.8999999999999s)]
*  This is just basic facts. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1727.1799999999998s)]
*  Totally true. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1728.54s)]
*  They're so clever that if you criticize them, they will leak to people that you work for [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1729.54s)]
*  them. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1734.02s)]
*  I happen to know. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1735.02s)]
*  Which is kind of brilliant. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1736.02s)]
*  If you're an effective critic of CIA, Joe Kent, and I've lived this personally, but [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1738.9799999999998s)]
*  also Joe Kent is just a wonderful man, a totally sincere man. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1743.86s)]
*  Great man. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1747.54s)]
*  Former CIA contractor lost his wife in Syria in Obama's Syria war and became an opponent [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1748.54s)]
*  of the way things are running. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1753.58s)]
*  And CIA played in his primary. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1755.46s)]
*  And the way they did it was by convincing Republican primary voters that Joe Kent, who's [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1758.42s)]
*  the single most effective critic of CIA in the United States, was actually working for [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1762.6200000000001s)]
*  CIA. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1768.02s)]
*  I mean, like, wow. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1769.02s)]
*  I tip my non-existent hat in deference to the brilliance of that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1770.02s)]
*  This is how brilliant they are. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1773.8600000000001s)]
*  You notice from President Trump the arc that he went through on Friday. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1774.94s)]
*  You know something's up when David Ignatius at the Washington Post, which we call the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1778.9s)]
*  Langley Bugle. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1783.14s)]
*  He's ahead the cops. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1785.74s)]
*  Oh, where? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1786.74s)]
*  When Ignatius comes out on Morning Joe and says, Trump is doing such a really magnificent [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1787.74s)]
*  job here, he's acting like your commander-in-chief, that should be the red flare that goes up [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1792.0200000000002s)]
*  and goes, what the fuck? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1796.0200000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1797.5800000000002s)]
*  It's too friends-like. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1798.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't have a TV because it's too frustrating to watch. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1799.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't know a single person who doesn't like David Ignatius personally, and that would [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1803.5s)]
*  include me, and he's just such a courtly man. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1806.66s)]
*  He's like the Murdochs. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1808.98s)]
*  He's just like, you can't dislike him. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1809.98s)]
*  He's just got elaborate, wonderful manners. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1810.98s)]
*  He's very nice. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1813.5s)]
*  But he is the spokesman for CIA, and you wonder... [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1814.5s)]
*  The Washington Post is the Langley Bugle. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1818.1399999999999s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1819.62s)]
*  It's when Louis Joyland West, who was one of the last visitors to Jack Ruby in his cell [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1820.62s)]
*  before he went insane, was a CIA physician and deeply involved in a lot of really dark, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1826.06s)]

*  When he died, I went and looked up the Walter Pincus obit from the Washington Post. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1835.1s)]
*  Walter Pincus was the CIA obit. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1838.9399999999998s)]
*  I think Walter Pincus wrote it. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1841.1799999999998s)]
*  And there was no mention in the Washington Post obit that Jolly West worked for CIA. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1843.66s)]
*  And I just look, oh my god. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1846.66s)]
*  This is like... [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1848.66s)]
*  But you wonder, do people watching Morning Joe have any idea who these people are? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1849.66s)]
*  No. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1854.5s)]
*  That's the whole... [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1855.5s)]

*  Angleton runs the deal and he was the counterterrorism... [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1971.58s)]
*  Yeah, counterintell, yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1973.7s)]
*  Legendary guy there forever. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1975.7s)]
*  And he goes to, I think, the Metropolitan Club for dinner and Angleton would take a [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1978.02s)]
*  drink and Gary Hart's sitting there kind of working him and so towards the end of the [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1983.82s)]
*  evening, he can't get up enough courage to ask the question. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1987.1s)]
*  So finally he says, you know, it's about over, I got to do this. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1990.02s)]
*  He says, look, Mr. Angleton, I just got a question from the committee. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1992.58s)]
*  We need to know, did the CIA have anything to do with the Kennedy assassination? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=1996.62s)]
*  He asked Angleton that? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2001.3799999999999s)]
*  Ask Angleton. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2002.3799999999999s)]
*  It's in the book, hold it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2003.3799999999999s)]
*  Angleton takes another drink, puts it down and goes, Senator Hart, you were a theology [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2004.3799999999999s)]
*  major, were you not? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2012.06s)]
*  He goes, yeah, as a matter of fact, I was a theology major. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2013.1399999999999s)]
*  So you know the New and Old Testament pretty well? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2015.5s)]
*  He goes, well enough. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2019.78s)]
*  In my father's house, there are many mansions. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2022.78s)]
*  Gary Hart goes, what the fuck? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2026.7s)]
*  Didn't ask another question. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2029.5s)]
*  Went back to church in Mansfield. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2031.1s)]
*  Mansfield goes, okay, shut it down. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2032.7s)]
*  He goes, no, this is why they came out the CIA. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2034.6599999999999s)]
*  Remember, they had tried to kill guys in the Congo. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2037.22s)]
*  They even had the cigar in Castro. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2039.3799999999999s)]
*  But the thing about the domestic stuff at all, that all got shut down immediately and [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2042.1399999999999s)]
*  they figured, oh, there's a Lumbumba in... [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2045.54s)]
*  Patrice Lumbumba in Congo. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2048.9s)]
*  In Congo and they had tried to kill or killed three or four other guys, maybe Dag Hammarskjold, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2050.1s)]
*  who knows? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2054.74s)]
*  Definitely Dag Hammarskjold. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2055.74s)]
*  They got into all these things that the American people are interested in, why are you killing [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2056.74s)]
*  foreign leaders? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2059.66s)]
*  But they didn't get to the heart of many mansions. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2060.74s)]
*  Gary Hart goes, I'm not going any farther on this one, right? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2062.94s)]
*  And within 10 years, Frank Church is dead of galloping cancer and Gary Hart is totally [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2066.1s)]
*  destroyed in 1988 through the... [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2071.24s)]
*  The leading presidential candidate at the time. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2073.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2076.2s)]
*  With a picture... [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2077.2s)]
*  Get lured onto the monkey business. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2078.2s)]
*  And then his house, the first time they ever surrounded his house, remember? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2079.4399999999996s)]
*  Oh, I'll never forget it at all. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2083.4399999999996s)]
*  And boy, and the Washington Post led the charge. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2085.24s)]
*  I'm not for Gary Hart or whatever, but he, by today's standards... [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2086.8799999999997s)]
*  Don't cross him, though. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2089.68s)]
*  You're going to... [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2090.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2091.7599999999998s)]
*  There's going to be payback. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2092.7599999999998s)]
*  It's literally unbelievable. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  But you can't... [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2094.7599999999998s)]
*  How do you have a real country in the middle of that? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  Like I don't understand... [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2098.64s)]
*  Well, you can't. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2099.64s)]
*  I mean, we've come a certain point since 1963. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2101.04s)]
*  We've devolved. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2103.44s)]
*  And that's why... [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2104.44s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2105.44s)]
*  As Elon was the special government employee to do Doge to try to get waste from abuse, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2106.44s)]
*  I think because we're at war now and the war we're at is an internal war. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2111.48s)]
*  It's an internal war with this apparatus that we finally have a leader that could have the [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2115.68s)]
*  back of people that will go in, because he wants it taken down. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2121.0s)]
*  I think he's getting terrible advice around that. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2124.44s)]
*  like you, not to organize it, but who knows the history of these institutions and quite [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2127.24s)]
*  frankly where the bodies are buried, have to come in as a special government employee [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  to help get the people on they're going to organize. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2137.4s)]
*  We have to go to war against the deep state now. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2139.64s)]
*  If we don't go to war with the deep state immediately and have a couple of wins that [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2142.48s)]
*  we can point to and some momentum and put them on their back leg, their back foot in [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2146.84s)]
*  the next 200 days, nothing in America is going to change. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2151.36s)]
*  We should be clear about who's serving its interest. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2154.88s)]
*  Tom Cotton, who's the chairman of the Senate Intel Committee, the select committee on intelligence, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2157.5600000000004s)]
*  was one of the primary drivers of secrecy around the Kennedy files. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2162.32s)]
*  Tom Cotton, I think, was born in the 80s and I like Tom Cotton a lot. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2168.52s)]
*  I know him. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2171.1600000000003s)]
*  I know his wife who worked at CIA, super nice people. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2172.1600000000003s)]
*  But when it came down to it, when Trump gets elected and gets inaugurated in January, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  Tom Cotton's... [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2179.0800000000004s)]
*  He's denied this, but he's lying because it's true. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2180.0800000000004s)]
*  I know for a fact, Tom Cotton's running around being like, well, whatever we do, we can't [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2182.0s)]
*  put people in place. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2185.56s)]
*  We're going to declassify all the Kennedy assassination files. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2186.56s)]
*  Sixty-two years later, I think Tom Cotton was born in the 80s. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2189.28s)]
*  Why would he care? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2192.64s)]
*  It's not a sources and methods thing anymore. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2193.64s)]
*  What is that? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2195.56s)]
*  Why would Tom Cotton be so concerned about releasing the Kennedy documents that he's [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2196.56s)]
*  trying to prevent people from getting jobs on the basis of his belief that they might [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2203.1s)]
*  reveal those documents? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2208.26s)]
*  What is that? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2209.52s)]
*  It's disqualifying. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2212.58s)]
*  He shouldn't be in the Senate, of course. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2213.58s)]
*  He knows that that is the key that can pick the lock, that something happened in 1963. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2215.06s)]
*  We had a coup d'etat. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2220.26s)]
*  The country's never faced up to it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2221.86s)]
*  The country understands that like 80% something's dead wrong. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2223.54s)]
*  They understood at the time the Warren Commission was gun decked. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2227.02s)]
*  You go back and read this new book in by a New York Times writer, you see what a joke [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2229.38s)]
*  it was, how the FBI stepped in immediately. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2234.16s)]
*  Jerry Ford was their guy. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2236.1s)]
*  It was a complete joke. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2238.3s)]
*  He was a made president without an election. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2239.3s)]
*  Made president without an election? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2241.3s)]
*  I'm just saying there are no coincidences. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2242.3s)]
*  Jerry Ford of the Warren Commission becomes president without an election. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2244.42s)]
*  You're like, hmm, we're all. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2248.7000000000003s)]
*  If you go read, I've read the testimony of the Warren Commission. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2251.98s)]
*  In the Warren Commission, in the depository where the gunman sat, right next to him, the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2255.0600000000004s)]
*  guy, I think his name was Willie Davis, he was a worker, of the black guys were up on [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2262.42s)]
*  the top deck pointing afterwards when the shot took place, he was going to go join those [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2266.26s)]
*  guys. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2271.06s)]
*  He actually sat there and had his lunch right next to where the assassin was. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2272.06s)]
*  Now you know, assassins and CIA and Navy SEALs, I mean, their hearts beaten out of their chest [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2276.1s)]
*  before that happens because they understand it may be the last time they take a breath [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2282.02s)]
*  on earth is when they fire. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2286.1800000000003s)]
*  So they are really ready to meet their maker and they're highly focused. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2288.3s)]
*  The last thing you're going to do on earth is get that target. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2291.7000000000003s)]
*  That is just these cartons just suppressing by a few feet. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2294.62s)]
*  This guy's giving testimony and it's unbelievable. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2298.94s)]
*  They go, well, you were there. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2301.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2302.9s)]
*  What were you doing? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2303.9s)]
*  He says, I was eating a chicken sandwich, a bag of Fritos and a Coke. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2304.9s)]
*  And they're going, you're right next to him and everything's going and you're hanging [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2308.46s)]
*  on the edge of it. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2311.78s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, Jerry Ford steps in and goes, excuse me, I have a question. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2313.26s)]
*  Do you have a criminal record? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2319.18s)]
*  And the guy goes, excuse me? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2320.7000000000003s)]
*  He goes, do you have a criminal record? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2322.86s)]
*  And the guy goes, well, I was picked up. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2324.94s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2326.18s)]
*  You're a felon, right? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2327.18s)]
*  The whole conversation drops. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2328.22s)]
*  I go, oh my God, we're literally at the moment, literally 10 minutes before the shot takes [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2329.8599999999997s)]

*  And it grieves me to say this because I like Tom and I think he's smart, really smart, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2468.02s)]

*  These questions have to be asked. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2558.74s)]
*  We have to ask what part of our government is going against the commander in chief and [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2559.74s)]
*  what the commander in chief is trying to do. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2563.62s)]
*  Is it legal for Lindsey to do that? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2565.42s)]
*  Well, there's Logan Act. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2567.14s)]
*  I called for his arrest. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2569.1s)]
*  Or cancel his passport. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2572.46s)]
*  Do two things, either don't land back in the country or arrest him. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2574.14s)]
*  And I'm adamant about this in Pompeo also because I think there are arguments around [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2578.02s)]
*  the Logan Act that they're over there countering what the commander in chief is trying to do. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2581.38s)]
*  And they have security clearances too, which I don't have. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2585.7799999999997s)]
*  And you don't have, I assume, a security clearance. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2588.8999999999996s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2591.7799999999997s)]

*  No, I don't either. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2594.7799999999997s)]
*  Because you said, hey, don't blame me. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2595.7799999999997s)]
*  Why does Lindsey Graham and why does Mike Pompeo have a security clearance? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2599.66s)]
*  Well, I think you have to ask Mike because I'm very disappointed in him. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2603.06s)]
*  I knew him for years. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2605.7s)]
*  The guy I know today, the guy I see today is not the guy I knew. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2607.7s)]
*  And I think people have to... [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2610.62s)]
*  I think they ought to come on when they come on TV is they ought to have the NASCAR drivers. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2612.06s)]
*  Whose payroll are they on? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2617.86s)]
*  The American people are... [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2619.62s)]
*  At least they ought to be in a Chiron who they're taking money from. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2620.62s)]
*  What's the deal with... [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2626.3s)]
*  Let me just say I've known Lindsey for 25 years. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2627.3s)]
*  And it's impossible not to like Lindsey Graham. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2631.02s)]
*  He's one of the most charming, funny... [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2633.34s)]
*  He's just a wonderful person to travel with. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2636.46s)]
*  He's the most charming person in the world. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2640.02s)]
*  I'll just say that because it's just true. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2641.38s)]
*  I like him. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2642.38s)]
*  If he was here, I would be having fun with Lindsey Graham. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2643.38s)]
*  But his effect on the United States is so destructive. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2645.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't understand what that is. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2648.78s)]
*  What is his motive? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2650.26s)]
*  You know him well, of course, because you're... [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2651.26s)]
*  Well, I know. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2652.7000000000003s)]
*  Look, I think, number one, he's very involved in the Pentagon, on our services committee, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2653.7000000000003s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2658.98s)]
*  The building runs like the building's going to run. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2659.98s)]
*  I mean, it's a trillion dollar... [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2661.3s)]
*  Why when President Trump says, we're going to go to a hemispheric defense from Greenland [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2663.1800000000003s)]

*  the new great game of the 21st century. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2672.14s)]
*  To the Panama Canal, because they're going to block the Chinese and Russian neighbors [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2675.22s)]
*  and get the Chinese out of the Caribbean. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2677.94s)]
*  We'll deal with Venezuela. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2679.7s)]
*  We'll have the Central Pacific, which has always been kind of our strategic pivot, the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2681.3s)]
*  three island chains. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2684.78s)]
*  And America's hermetically sealed. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2685.78s)]
*  You add a golden dome or some sort of ballistic missile, America can live in peace and we [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2687.94s)]
*  can do... [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2692.82s)]
*  And we can do expeditionary... [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2693.82s)]
*  Not that we're not engaged in the world. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2695.86s)]
*  You can do expeditionary forces anywhere you want in the world. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2697.26s)]
*  You can put Chinese infrastructure in St. Croix, which they have a lot of in St. Croix, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2699.94s)]
*  which we control. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2704.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2705.54s)]
*  So you can't let the Chinese control your hemisphere. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2706.54s)]
*  That seems reasonable. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2708.38s)]
*  And they'll say to us, okay, get out of Japan. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2709.42s)]
*  At which point you say, okay. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2711.42s)]
*  I mean, that seems like logical. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2713.3s)]
*  This budget is not a trillion dollars going up, right? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2715.3s)]
*  Because right now it's over a trillion dollars. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2719.78s)]
*  If you add the supplement that's coming in, the reconciliation bill with the NDAA, you're [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2721.2999999999997s)]
*  over a trillion dollars and it's only going to keep increasing. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2725.98s)]
*  This is the way the defense contractors make money. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2729.1s)]
*  They embedded it over there. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2731.9s)]
*  They kind of run the building right now. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2733.14s)]
*  You don't see any pushback by armed services. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2734.86s)]
*  In fact, every district's got huge plants. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2736.62s)]
*  As you know, our industrial policy that we do have is really around arms manufacturing. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2738.74s)]
*  Yes, that's it. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2743.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2744.46s)]
*  And it's a high margin business and we want to sell weapons to the entire world. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2745.46s)]
*  It's that system that's run in the country. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2749.42s)]
*  Remember, the difference between President Trump's first term and his second term is [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2751.7000000000003s)]
*  what happened under Biden is a massive concentration of power because they didn't back Lena Kahn [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2755.58s)]
*  or the antitrust people like we have now in President Trump's administration, like Gail [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2760.5s)]
*  Slater and what's happening to the FTC under Andrew Ferguson, taking big tech to court [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  and trying to break them up. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2769.94s)]
*  Right now you have Wall Street, you have big tech, you have big agriculture, you have big [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2771.38s)]
*  pharma, you have the big healthcare industry, you have the defense contractors, you have [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2777.7s)]
*  the concentration of these massive industries that have every lobbyist, every communications [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2781.2599999999998s)]
*  expert, all the big law firms on their payroll. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2788.06s)]
*  If you and I wanted to start today and say, hey, guess what? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2790.8199999999997s)]
*  We want to take on one of the industries. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2792.7799999999997s)]
*  Let's take on Big Ag. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2794.66s)]
*  You literally can't get a great law firm to represent you or a great lobbyist because [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2796.04s)]
*  they're all hired by these guys. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2800.3399999999997s)]
*  That concentration- And they'll set up regulatory hurdles that are insurmountable. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2803.1s)]
*  This is the regulatory cap. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2807.22s)]
*  I'm living that in something that we're doing on the side. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2808.22s)]
*  You just find out that it's crazy. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2812.4599999999996s)]
*  That concentration of power. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2816.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2817.52s)]
*  Regulatory capture and really regulatory merger. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2818.52s)]
*  We said when we gave China everything after Tiananmen Square, when we gave most favorite [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2821.7799999999997s)]
*  nation status and WTO and access that the more they get prosperous by, because they [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2825.8199999999997s)]
*  were a backward agricultural country at the time, the more prosperous they get, the more [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2831.3799999999997s)]
*  they'll become like a liberal democracy like the United States. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2835.9s)]
*  We actually have copied the model of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2838.7000000000003s)]
*  They have a handful of state-owned industries, very powerful, merged in with the central [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2841.7000000000003s)]
*  government, an authoritarian government. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2846.54s)]
*  That's what we have. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2849.06s)]
*  That's what President Trump, the promise of President Trump is to break that. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2850.06s)]
*  The American people don't want it. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2853.94s)]
*  They hate it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2855.3s)]
*  Now, they need the tools to do it. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2856.3s)]
*  That's why I think this next couple of hundred days coming after the 10th anniversary of [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2857.94s)]
*  really President Trump, because what happened? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2862.1400000000003s)]
*  At the top of the escalator, Trump was in seventh place because people didn't know if [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2864.2599999999998s)]
*  he's serious about running or not. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2868.18s)]
*  He had just gone to CPAC, I think 90 days before. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2869.9399999999996s)]
*  In the 2015 CPAC, Trump finished seventh in the poll at 3.5% behind all these guys. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2872.9399999999996s)]
*  At the top of the escalator, he's in seventh. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2880.4199999999996s)]
*  That night they do a flash poll, I think, on CNN. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2884.22s)]
*  He's first. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2886.54s)]
*  Why? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2887.54s)]
*  That talk was in a nomenclature and a vernacular that American people hadn't heard from a policy [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2888.54s)]
*  politician about the border, about deportations, about China, about bringing jobs back, about [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2894.18s)]
*  ending the forever wars. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2899.74s)]
*  Remember, as the campaign went on, he goes to South Carolina. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2901.02s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2904.06s)]
*  And in South Carolina, he literally blew up the entire, not just Bush apparatus, kind [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2905.06s)]
*  of Fox and kind of everybody on the right that had been in there. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2910.02s)]
*  And when he said it, you could hear the audience gasp. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2913.8199999999997s)]
*  And so many commentators came on and said, well, that's the end of him because- [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2916.4199999999996s)]
*  They all said that. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2919.06s)]
*  Except me. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2920.54s)]
*  I was the only one at Fox News who I knew. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2921.58s)]
*  I was like, yes, thank you for telling the truth, finally. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2923.7799999999997s)]
*  But everybody around you was that he's finished. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2928.42s)]
*  They hated me for agreeing with him. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2930.06s)]
*  They hated me personally. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2931.7s)]
*  And he won in a landslide. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2932.7s)]
*  Karl Rove, never, who was my neighbor, and always got along with him. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2934.14s)]
*  Again, perfectly charming guy, sort of. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2937.66s)]
*  Not a good person at all, but smart. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2942.1s)]
*  You know, Karl. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2944.74s)]
*  But after that, that was the moment I realized it was in that Greenville, South Carolina [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2945.74s)]
*  debate that all that mattered to them was a projection of force abroad. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2949.9s)]
*  That's it. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2954.1800000000003s)]
*  Everything else was just silly. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2955.1800000000003s)]
*  Because they were so shocked he said it and united the fact that he can't win. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2956.1800000000003s)]
*  That's when Bill Kristol turned against him was that night. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2960.34s)]
*  And if you could look it up, check his Twitter feed. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2962.54s)]
*  The day before, Kristol was like, you know, Trump's kind of a pig, but he's our pig. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2965.46s)]
*  And actually, we can kind of use him. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2969.62s)]
*  And maybe we should make peace with Trump. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2971.38s)]
*  Bill Kristol said that, who I used to work for for many years. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2974.1800000000003s)]
*  The day after that Greenville debate, he took the position that he has now, which is, you [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2977.2599999999998s)]
*  know, we'll destroy the country to prevent Trump from exercising power. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2981.62s)]
*  Like he was a sworn enemy of Donald Trump's after that when he came out against the Iraq [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2984.74s)]
*  War. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2988.02s)]
*  How weird. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2989.02s)]
*  Why... [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2991.2599999999998s)]
*  If you hit something...if you killed a child in a DUI, okay, you're drunk, you accidentally [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2992.8999999999996s)]
*  run over a child, there's no possibility you could meaningfully advance in American life [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=2997.2599999999998s)]
*  because people would say, we've forgiven you, Steve, but you did something that's so... [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3002.5s)]
*  It's just horrible. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3006.94s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3007.94s)]
*  It was a mistake, but it was horrible. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3008.94s)]
*  We allowed the architects of the Iraq War, who gravely injured the United States, got [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3011.82s)]
*  all these people killed, Americans killed, to continue to advance. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3016.5800000000004s)]
*  They were never held to account for what they did, ever, at all. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3020.3s)]
*  They became the head of the World Bank. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3024.42s)]
*  But how do we do that? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3025.42s)]
*  The specter of that is what we face over the last 72 hours. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3026.6200000000003s)]
*  This is exactly the same pitch as the Iraq War. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3030.5400000000004s)]
*  Weapons of mass destruction. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3033.46s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3034.46s)]
*  So they understand one thing. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3035.78s)]
*  They think the playbook works. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3038.3s)]
*  This is why we have to stop it now. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3040.06s)]
*  If we don't stop it now, it's going to work all the time. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3041.3s)]
*  They think that playbook of lulling the American people to sleep and tell them there's these [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3044.62s)]
*  evil people that have to be taken down, or if they're taken down, everything's going [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3049.78s)]
*  to be fine after that, and that we face an apocalypse if that doesn't happen. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3053.14s)]
*  They're running the Iraq War playbook over again with almost some of the same players [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3057.3s)]
*  or at least the proteges in the verticals of who those players were. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3060.7400000000002s)]
*  But why does institutional conservatism allow it? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3065.18s)]
*  If Mike Pompeo shows up at the Republican county of dinner in some state, like he's [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3067.46s)]
*  treated as... [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3074.34s)]
*  I was in a restaurant with him recently. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3075.34s)]
*  Everyone's like, oh, Mike Pompeo. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3076.34s)]
*  He's treated as like a legitimate person. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3077.98s)]
*  No one has ever...the right does not hold its own people accountable on the most basic [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3080.46s)]
*  level. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3086.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, when we say the right, the Republican Party is controlled opposition, okay? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3087.2599999999998s)]
*  Because they've never really put in a fight. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3090.58s)]
*  Let's go back to the three central tenets of Trumpism, immigration, border and sovereignty, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3092.22s)]
*  trade and ending forever wars. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3098.22s)]
*  The official apparatus of the Republican Party hates all three of them and doesn't agree [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3099.7799999999997s)]
*  with any of them. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3104.18s)]
*  Do you think that's still true? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3105.18s)]
*  It's 100%. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3107.1s)]
*  Look what happened here in the last 24 hours on the immigration side. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3108.1s)]
*  All of a sudden, they promulgated that because of big agriculture's needs, that we can no [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3112.4199999999996s)]
*  longer have raids on farms, raids in hotels, all of it, that that had to be counted by [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3119.42s)]
*  President Trump saying, hey, there's 20 men, illegal aliens. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3124.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to get them all out of here. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3126.94s)]
*  And then today or this morning, he came out with, we're going to triple down the raids [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3127.94s)]
*  in sanctuary cities, right? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3131.98s)]
*  I'm going to get all these guys out of here. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3132.98s)]
*  No, there's huge institutional fight led by Fox News, right? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3134.86s)]
*  Their biggest is the forever wars. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3138.54s)]
*  But if you look at the Wall Street Journal and if you look at Fox News on the trade and [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3140.82s)]
*  bringing jobs back from China, they're very ambivalent about that. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3145.7400000000002s)]
*  They're talking about the cost of living. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3149.06s)]
*  I mean, they're putting up that, you know, because they're all free traders, which is [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3150.06s)]
*  the way the country got in the first place. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3153.4599999999996s)]
*  They're also quite ambivalent on the immigration and mass deportation. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3156.7s)]
*  Remember, mass deportation is just not the criminals. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3161.18s)]
*  You have to get, President Trump said they'd take 20 million. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3163.7799999999997s)]
*  I say it's 10, came in on Biden's watch. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3166.2599999999998s)]
*  They all have to leave. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3169.22s)]
*  But you're seeing a lot of ambivalence of that, particularly the Republican Party. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3170.58s)]
*  They're saying the Wall Street Journal says, well, no, they add 2%, one and a half to 2% [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3173.3399999999997s)]
*  to GDP, right, because they buy so much stuff. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3177.82s)]
*  Number two, they've driven down wages among particularly low skilled black and Hispanics. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3180.42s)]
*  I say this is why we put the coalition together. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3185.42s)]
*  This is why 39% of black men are voting for us. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3187.86s)]
*  This is why South Texas is now MAGA territory, because they understand their wages to be [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3190.38s)]
*  driven down. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3194.9s)]
*  So I think the Republican Party hates the basic tenets of President Trump's platform, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3196.0800000000004s)]
*  particularly the one they most hate is ending the forever wars. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3201.6600000000003s)]
*  That's tied to both Wall Street. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3205.1800000000003s)]
*  It's tied to the defense industry. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3206.78s)]
*  It's also tied to this mentality that we have in American Empire. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3208.6200000000003s)]
*  Remember, you and I saying, hey, we are actually a republic. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3211.78s)]
*  We want to go back to being a republic. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3215.02s)]
*  The founders of our country, when they set the Constitution, they looked to Republican [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3217.0600000000004s)]
*  Rome. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3221.3s)]
*  That was their source of things, not the Roman Empire. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3222.3s)]
*  What we've done, in fact, they said, I think it was General Washington, don't go overseas [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3225.9s)]
*  looking for monsters to slay. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3231.7000000000003s)]
*  We have enough to do here. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3233.94s)]
*  Let's do this. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3235.6800000000003s)]
*  We've got to do this. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3237.58s)]
*  That's what we've gotten so far of track, and we have an American Empire. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3238.58s)]
*  That empire has to be taken apart brick by brick, because all it's done is to basically [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3239.9199999999996s)]
*  destroy the inner workings of the United States and just particularly destroy the very people [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3245.72s)]
*  who are the cannon fodder in these wars, right? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3250.9199999999996s)]
*  And that's why... [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3253.9199999999996s)]
*  Destroy the nation. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3254.9199999999996s)]
*  Drive around the country. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3255.9199999999996s)]
*  Just get in your vehicle and drive. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3256.9199999999996s)]
*  And I don't see how anybody could say things are better now than they were 15 or 20 years [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3258.68s)]
*  ago or 40 years ago. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3264.2799999999997s)]
*  And so the empire destroys the country. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3266.52s)]
*  And you add on top of it the national debt and the trillion dollars every month and the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3269.24s)]
*  discussions. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3272.88s)]
*  We have a discussion. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3273.88s)]
*  Doge goes to a bunch of different places, but they never go to the Pentagon. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3275.4s)]
*  They're not really allowed to go to the Pentagon. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3278.92s)]
*  We have a budget that we're talking about how do we make these cuts, how do you cut [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3281.04s)]
*  Medicaid, how do you cut the food stamp program, which all have to be looked at and done. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3284.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's sacrosanct. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3288.12s)]
*  We can't even talk about defense. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3289.12s)]
*  We have a trillion dollar defense budget. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3290.2799999999997s)]
*  And I keep saying, Trump's laid out a strategy of hemispheric defense. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3292.2s)]
*  It's very different than post-war, where we're everywhere, the American empire, and really [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3296.0s)]
*  around the ring of the Eurasian landmass, right? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3300.7999999999997s)]
*  And I said, he's talking about a hemispheric defense. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3303.24s)]
*  The budget is totally misaligned with the hemispheric defense, both in the allocation [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3305.96s)]
*  than the Navy taking down big army. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3309.9199999999996s)]
*  But hey, baby, the defense budget is going to go and you're not going to cut a penny [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3312.0s)]
*  Because like you, you're raising your voice as someone that likes Israel and agrees with [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3317.36s)]
*  Israeli national... [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3322.96s)]
*  You're saying that you raise your voice and all of a sudden you're being eviscerated that [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3324.36s)]
*  you're an enemy of the Jewish people, that you're an anti-Semite. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3328.08s)]
*  Not just that, you're an appeaser. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3331.1600000000003s)]
*  And he said, talk as a pacifist, right? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3333.1600000000003s)]
*  Appeasant a pacifist because they understand... [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3336.88s)]
*  Show up at my house and find out how far my pacifism extends. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3339.1600000000003s)]
*  No, it's slander and it bothers me simply because it does convince people whose opinions [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3342.24s)]
*  I care about and who I care about personally, and it fractures relationships. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3350.2s)]
*  And it also comes from people I know really well, and that Ari Fleischer, who I've never [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3355.96s)]
*  respected, but I always liked him. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3360.48s)]
*  And he wrote something, somebody sent me this thing yesterday, and I'm just a carnival [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3362.6s)]
*  barker and I'm pretending to have my views. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3367.44s)]
*  And I texted him and I was like, come on. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3369.12s)]
*  You know I may be totally wrong. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3373.0s)]
*  You of course disagree with me. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3374.52s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3375.88s)]
*  But you know that I'm sincere. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3376.96s)]
*  I'm totally sincere. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3377.96s)]
*  Why else would I do this? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3378.96s)]
*  Of course, he didn't respond to me, but it's painful. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3379.96s)]
*  Ari, who every day went to the podium and told us... [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3382.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3385.68s)]
*  ...just another day away from finding weapons of mass destruction. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3386.68s)]
*  How could they sit there and lie in the nation? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3388.48s)]
*  Now, I am quite serious. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3390.6s)]
*  Given... [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3393.16s)]
*  Because you're a product of Washington, D.C. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3394.16s)]
*  There's no one better in an emergency. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3399.12s)]
*  We have an emergency. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3400.92s)]
*  To break the glass emergency, to actually be an advisor to the president in a temporary [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3402.8s)]

*  You know the canvas. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3410.08s)]
*  Not that you're Oregon, but you could sit there in the NSC in the tank or the tanks [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3411.64s)]
*  of Pentagon, but down where the Kennedy room and actually walk through, this is the apparatus. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3417.28s)]
*  This is what we have to do. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3423.04s)]
*  This is what we have to do with the FBI. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3424.04s)]
*  This is what we have to do with the CIA. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3425.8s)]
*  This is what we have to do with D&I, the Pentagon. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3426.8s)]
*  And then we have people execute that. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3429.32s)]
*  I would never survive that. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3431.0s)]
*  But I mean, I don't come back... [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3432.76s)]
*  I had breakfast alone in the dining room in the Metropolitan Club this morning, which [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3434.28s)]
*  is a place I love. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3437.28s)]
*  It's the only person there. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3438.28s)]

*  And the second I walk outside that building, I'm like, whoa, the vibe in the city is... [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3442.84s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3447.0s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3448.0s)]
*  Can you feel that? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3449.0s)]
*  I can feel it. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3450.0s)]
*  Ever since President Trump left in January of 2021, because there was an armed camp then. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3451.0s)]
*  We had a round of the... [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3455.92s)]
*  I left by then. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3457.36s)]
*  I was like, I'm out. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3458.36s)]
*  You came to the war room. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3459.36s)]
*  We had 100 National Guard troops with two Humvees, barbed wire everywhere. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3461.5600000000004s)]
*  It took from the guys at Fox and One America to come up to the war room. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3465.92s)]
*  It's only a five-minute walk up the hill. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3469.1200000000003s)]
*  45 minutes to get there. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3471.2400000000002s)]
*  You had to go through checkpoints. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3472.44s)]
*  Ever since that time... [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3474.0800000000004s)]
*  And I hate to say it, with all the positive energy President Trump has brought, it's still [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3475.88s)]
*  a dark specter. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3480.0s)]
*  This Imperial Capitol is probably... [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3481.48s)]
*  I tell you why. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3483.1600000000003s)]
*  They understand there's an internal civil war here, that one side's going to win and [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3484.5200000000004s)]
*  one side is going to lose. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3488.6800000000003s)]
*  Their belief is they're going to wait us out. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3490.92s)]
*  That for all the Tucker Carlson's and Steve Bannon's and other people around President [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3493.1600000000003s)]
*  Trump are sitting there going, the Bobby Kennedys, and other people that know how this apparatus [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3496.96s)]
*  works at every level, and are sitting there going, we have to do this now. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3501.92s)]
*  They believe that they will wait President Trump out. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3505.52s)]
*  And I don't put a possibility of an assassin... [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3508.1200000000003s)]
*  If President Trump is to go too far into this and bring you into that, do not think they [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3512.52s)]
*  would not think of an assassination attempt. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3517.0s)]
*  They have no intention of turning over control and power of the most powerful empire in man's [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3519.08s)]
*  history. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3526.08s)]
*  It has to be taken from them. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3527.08s)]
*  And I tell people, we either do it now, if we don't do it now, this wave of people that [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3528.24s)]
*  have come together, we're not going to be able to do it. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3534.3199999999997s)]
*  And if we don't do it, I'm not sure we win another election. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3538.08s)]
*  Because I think people are going to force us into doing either not deporting the 10 [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3541.96s)]
*  and not securing the border, not forcing China and not really cutting tough deals that start [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3546.8799999999997s)]
*  to bring real high value added manufacturing jobs back because Wall Street doesn't want [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3550.8399999999997s)]
*  that. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3554.68s)]
*  They think our labor cost is too high. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3555.68s)]
*  They think the environmental cost is too high. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3557.2s)]
*  They love the slave labor of Lao Weijian. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3558.96s)]
*  And most importantly, they're not going to stop the war machine. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3561.44s)]
*  They're not going to stop... [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3565.12s)]
*  And I'm not a pacifist. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3566.12s)]
*  I spent eight years of my life as a naval officer. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3567.12s)]
*  My daughter went to West Point. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3568.12s)]
*  She fought in Iraq in 2010 under Obama. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3569.3599999999997s)]
*  It's not that we're pacifists. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3573.24s)]
*  We see what we see. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3574.68s)]
*  And what we see now is a very evil specter over this imperial capital. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3576.74s)]
*  And one side is going to win. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3581.44s)]
*  The President Trump rebels are revolutionaries versus his Petroleum Guard apparatus. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3583.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's why this fight to me is going to happen. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3588.52s)]
*  The next 200 or 300 days, we're going to know what side this is going to... [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3590.2799999999997s)]
*  We're going to know if there's enough momentum on our side to actually win. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3595.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3597.7599999999998s)]
*  You get this spiritual thing. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3598.7599999999998s)]
*  And you can... [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3599.96s)]
*  I texted my wife this morning. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3600.96s)]
*  Second, this administration is gone. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3601.96s)]
*  I'm never coming back here. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3603.6s)]
*  And I mean, I spent... [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3604.84s)]
*  Got here in 1985. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3607.04s)]
*  And it's really shocking. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3608.04s)]
*  You feel that though when you're here. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3610.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3612.16s)]
*  It's just dark. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3613.16s)]
*  It's super dark. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3614.16s)]
*  And where I live normally is very... [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3615.44s)]
*  It's not thriving at all. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3618.2s)]
*  It's poor. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3619.2s)]
*  And there are lots of problems. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3620.2s)]
*  And people die of drug ODs and all that. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3621.2s)]
*  But you don't feel... [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3622.4s)]
*  A lot of people die of drug ODs. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3623.7599999999998s)]
*  But you do not feel this kind of... [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3624.7599999999998s)]
*  We sold our house five years ago. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3628.04s)]
*  My wife sold it over the phone. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3629.48s)]
*  Next thing I know, there is a... [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3632.6s)]
*  It was a great, beautiful house. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3634.04s)]
*  Super pretty house. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3635.84s)]
*  Not huge, but beautiful in the District of Columbia. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3636.84s)]
*  And she sells it to a CIA officer. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3640.72s)]
*  But of course. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3642.72s)]
*  And the next thing you know, there's a Ukraine flag flying from my flagpole. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3644.92s)]
*  And I'm not making this up. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3648.16s)]
*  And my neighbor sent it to me. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3650.24s)]
*  He's like, oh, look what happened to your house. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3651.24s)]
*  A house I really loved. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3652.88s)]
*  And I was like, wow, that's just a metaphor. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3653.88s)]
*  But okay, so let me ask you. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3656.88s)]
*  You've made a couple of illusions. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3658.6s)]
*  I almost don't want to ask you because it's upsetting. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3660.96s)]
*  But to the country coming apart, to conflict here, clearly there's been a rise in violence. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3662.8s)]
*  This weird Minnesota story, which I'm not even going to ask you about because I don't [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3669.36s)]
*  understand it at all. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3671.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't think anybody does. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3672.5600000000004s)]
*  But I want to ask you about what's happening in California. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3675.0s)]
*  It does seem like resisting federal authority on immigration is an act of sedition more [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3677.0400000000004s)]
*  profound than anything they did at Fort Sumter in 1861. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3683.5600000000004s)]
*  And this is not resolved. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3687.5600000000004s)]
*  What are we watching right now in California with Gavin Newsom? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3690.16s)]
*  You're from D.C. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3693.0s)]
*  I'm from Richmond. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3694.0s)]
*  I'm raised in Richmond. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3695.0s)]
*  And I keep telling people, I thought we settled this about federal law and states' rights [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3696.0s)]
*  and succession in the mid-1860s. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3702.12s)]
*  We had a civil war to determine the outcome of this. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3704.88s)]
*  We've had that discussion. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3707.64s)]
*  We've had that argument. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3708.64s)]
*  It's been settled. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3709.64s)]
*  I said this to President Trump in the first term, that this whole thing of sanctuary cities [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3710.64s)]
*  states is absolutely a neoconfederate mentality that you can have. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3715.92s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, right? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3721.6800000000003s)]
*  Have you said that, Warren? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3722.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, I've said it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3723.6800000000003s)]
*  That it's neoconfederate. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3724.6800000000003s)]
*  He's so smart. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3725.6800000000003s)]
*  It's a neoconfederate. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3726.6800000000003s)]
*  It is. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3727.6800000000003s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3728.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm stealing that, by the way. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3730.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3731.6800000000003s)]
*  Because... [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3732.6800000000003s)]
*  So good. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3733.6800000000003s)]
*  Jackson, look, he had this thing before the Civil War with Andrew Jackson and John C. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3734.6800000000003s)]
*  Calhoun on tariffs. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3736.96s)]
*  Remember, the landed aristocracy in South Carolina were some of the richest people. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3738.96s)]
*  I think Charleston had more what would be equivalent to billionaires at the start of [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3743.88s)]
*  the Civil War than any place on earth. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3747.76s)]
*  And it shows in the battery down there. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3749.36s)]
*  Battery. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3751.48s)]
*  It's a magnificent city today. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3752.48s)]
*  It is. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3753.48s)]
*  John C. Calhoun, as his vice president, was going to stop and go down and defend South [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3754.48s)]
*  Carolina. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3759.56s)]
*  He said, we're not going to do these tariffs. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3760.56s)]
*  And Jackson said, I'm going to call the army down there. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3761.56s)]
*  And if Calhoun's defying me, I'm going to hang him from the first lamppost. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3765.44s)]
*  I mean, Jackson was a guy who was going to take immediate action. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3768.52s)]
*  What's happening in California is kind of the equivalent. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3771.36s)]
*  You've had the sanctions. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3774.52s)]
*  And if President Trump had not sent the troops in and federalized the National Guard, what [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3775.52s)]
*  happened in LA was what we see in all these cities. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3779.6s)]
*  It would have exploded, been the summer of love of 2025, where there was a lot more rhetoric [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3782.04s)]
*  than actually action. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3786.96s)]
*  One of the reasons President Trump had Bill Barr and Esper and all these people that wouldn't [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3787.96s)]
*  execute what he wanted. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3792.08s)]
*  Now he's got a team. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3793.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's why I'm so glad he came out last night and says, I'm doubling and tripling [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3794.6s)]
*  down the rates. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3798.0s)]
*  My recommendation on the show the day after this stuff happened over that weekend was [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3799.36s)]
*  President Trump ought to triple the ICE raids and he ought to go to schools. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3803.46s)]
*  Hey, they got to go. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3808.6s)]
*  They have to go. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3810.84s)]
*  And it's not pleasant. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3811.84s)]
*  We've got to be very humane about it. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3812.84s)]
*  But you have to have a show of force. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3814.26s)]
*  And if you need to send in the army, if you need to send in the federalized National Guard, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3816.08s)]
*  we have to do it. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3819.2000000000003s)]
*  California is the rail head of this. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3820.2000000000003s)]
*  That's why you have to break it there. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3822.6s)]
*  It's going to obviously pop up in Chicago and New York. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3823.88s)]
*  But you have to take... [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3826.36s)]
*  Stephen Miller said this. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3828.04s)]
*  I've known Stephen a long time. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3829.04s)]
*  You know, Andrew and Stephen Miller and Ben Shapiro, Alex Martin, they all came out of [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3830.04s)]
*  kind of West LA, right? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3834.1200000000003s)]
*  Ben may have been the valley, but they're all West LA guys. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3835.6800000000003s)]
*  Stephen Miller has been saying since the time I knew him, the war for America is going to [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3838.6800000000003s)]
*  be won or lost on the streets of Los Angeles. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3843.2000000000003s)]
*  He said this now for almost 20 years. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3845.48s)]
*  And this is what this fight and this is what's so disturbing about the timing. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3847.36s)]
*  We're totally focused on that and President Trump actually implementing the deportations [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3851.6400000000003s)]
*  of mass deportations. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3856.12s)]
*  And all of a sudden this thing breaks out in Persia, in the Middle East, and now the [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3857.12s)]
*  whole country is just focused on that. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3861.56s)]
*  It's almost like a time diversion to get our attention. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3863.72s)]
*  It does feel that way. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3866.04s)]
*  Because Bibi gave it up. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3867.52s)]
*  There was no... [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3869.2799999999997s)]
*  It didn't have to happen on Thursday night. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3870.2799999999997s)]
*  We were told what was leaked, oh, there's a bomb and they're going to have it. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3872.84s)]
*  And you know, this is something they have to have immediately, immediately, immediately. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3876.16s)]
*  He comes on Brad Bear and says, well, it's 12 or 13 months. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3878.98s)]
*  We've heard the 12 or 13 months for 20 years. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3881.44s)]
*  Maybe it is 12 or 13 months, but that doesn't mean you have to act on Friday. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3884.52s)]
*  Why is it Thursday and Friday when we're in the middle of actually the most important [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3888.2400000000002s)]
*  part of this Third World War is the 10 main invaders we've had in this country, or 20 [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3892.34s)]
*  main in court, and President Trump, they all have to go. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3896.8s)]
*  You understand that there's many bad actors that came in on this, right, that are now [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3899.36s)]
*  sleeper cells in this country. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3903.2400000000002s)]
*  Everybody's got to go and we have to do it. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3905.68s)]
*  That is the... [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3907.28s)]
*  When I talk about Third World War, the central battlefront for the United States of America [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3908.28s)]
*  is internal to the United States of America. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3912.76s)]
*  This is why we have to focus on this in the timing because there's no coincidences of [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3915.44s)]
*  how all of a sudden we're asked to do bombing runs in Iran a half a world away and it sucks [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3919.96s)]
*  up all the media attention that you don't even... [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3926.1200000000003s)]
*  There's not even a discussion on this and that's why President Trump coming out and [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3929.4s)]
*  doubling down and Homan and Stephen Miller, there ought to be three more raids tomorrow [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3931.6400000000003s)]
*  and we've got to get the focus back on that. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3935.92s)]
*  How should you deal with... [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3937.56s)]
*  I mean when Orval Faubus, who was the governor of Arkansas in 1956, presides over the state [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3939.24s)]
*  that refuses to desegregate after the Supreme Court says you have to desegregate in Brown [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3945.2799999999997s)]
*  versus Board. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3949.4s)]
*  And Dwight Eisenhower, who's not a liberal, says you can't ignore federal authority on [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3951.12s)]
*  a federal issue. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3957.96s)]
*  This is a Supreme Court decision and he sends the 101st Airborne to Little Rock to Central [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3958.96s)]
*  High School and says, sorry, you're going to desegregate. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3963.2s)]
*  Whatever you think of that, it's kind of disgusting in certain ways, but it's also essential to [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3965.2s)]
*  preserving the union. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3970.44s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3973.08s)]
*  How can you have your biggest state being like, no, to the federal government? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3974.32s)]
*  On a central issue. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3982.08s)]
*  On a central issue. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3983.08s)]
*  You have to have sovereignty. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3984.08s)]
*  Who lives here? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3985.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3986.08s)]
*  Who takes federal benefits? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3987.08s)]
*  Who's actually a citizen? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3988.08s)]
*  Who has allegiance to this country? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3989.08s)]
*  Who gets to choose our leadership in a democratic system? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3990.12s)]
*  This is why this radical neo-Marxist Democratic Party will fight. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3993.8s)]
*  This is the hill they will die on. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3997.36s)]
*  But I don't understand how you can put up with that. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=3998.6000000000004s)]
*  How can you put up with that? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4002.2400000000002s)]
*  That's maybe a little more important than whether Iran gets the bomb. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4003.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, you can't. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4005.76s)]
*  And by the way, the American people don't. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4006.76s)]
*  I think it's like 60-40 where they agree with President Trump on these mass deportations. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4009.1600000000003s)]
*  Remember, one of the reasons we're winning the African-American vote is President Trump [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4013.48s)]
*  does not believe like the Democratic Party and Kamala Harris in mass incarcerations. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4017.28s)]
*  He believes in mass deportation. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4021.5600000000004s)]
*  When I was in prison, the only thing I put up from Danbury was like on the 26th of August, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4022.7999999999997s)]
*  I said, hey, victory is at hand. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4026.6s)]
*  I can tell from the prisoners in Danbury, the young Hispanics and blacks who hate the [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4027.88s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4032.68s)]
*  And they particularly hated Kamala Harris. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4033.68s)]
*  You guys said, look, the Democratic Party is for mass incarcerations to break our families [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4035.2799999999997s)]
*  and to make us dependent upon the government. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4040.0s)]
*  These guys were smarter than guys going to Yale and the political science department [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4042.36s)]
*  because it's a lived experience of them. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4045.36s)]
*  And they support mass deportations because in a place like Danbury, 10% of the prison [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4047.6s)]
*  is bad hombres from these other countries that are the most dangerous criminals, convicts [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4051.72s)]
*  you have in these prisons. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4057.52s)]
*  People at the street level have our back on this. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4059.2s)]
*  This is this new coalition. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4062.2799999999997s)]
*  But we have to we have to succeed in this. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4063.96s)]
*  We have to succeed in the deportations and getting wages to rise. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4066.56s)]
*  In fact, I think there was something in the Wall Street Journal. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4069.7599999999998s)]
*  They said wages for low skilled workers are coming up. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4071.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4074.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4075.52s)]
*  Because guess what? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4076.52s)]
*  You have less non-citizens here competing as people in their own country shouldn't [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4077.52s)]
*  have to compete against a non-citizen for a job. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4081.04s)]
*  This is President Trump's the centerpiece of the entire Make America Great Again movement. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4084.36s)]
*  And that's why it has to succeed. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4089.52s)]
*  And everybody now in the official political apparatus is trying to thwart him in this. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4091.0s)]
*  And this is why it's so important for him to go in the deep state is also remember one [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4096.72s)]
*  of the reasons that DHS is burning through money and there's not as many deportations. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4100.88s)]
*  You talk to the guys at the White House, you talk to the guys at DHS, they're still playing [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4106.48s)]
*  by the old playbook. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4109.88s)]
*  In other words, they have to have a deportation order from a court. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4111.16s)]
*  They go to a guy's house and make sure there's no kids around. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4114.08s)]
*  They take like 20 agents a week to go serve on two people and get them out of here. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4116.68s)]
*  Well, obviously, that doesn't that's the old playbook. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4121.88s)]
*  You have to get much more aggressive on your deportations. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4124.400000000001s)]
*  I think Miller and Holman are trying to change the culture over there to actually do it. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4127.14s)]
*  But even there, the apparatus, it's the administrative state's got its own mind how they're going [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4131.4800000000005s)]
*  to do things. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4136.400000000001s)]
*  I think this is one of President Trump's big battles. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4137.400000000001s)]
*  My last question has to do with like the first principle from which these positions flow, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4139.76s)]
*  which is there's a certain segment of our population, I think the majority who think [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4144.52s)]
*  the US government's job is to help American citizens in America. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4148.4800000000005s)]
*  But there is another very powerful segment, which is most of the US government that believes [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4153.04s)]
*  the opposite. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4156.52s)]
*  10 years ago, I'm on an anthrac train to New York from Washington for work at Fox and I [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4157.52s)]
*  get a call from a neocon writer called Julia Ioffe, I think is Russian born, ready for [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4161.4400000000005s)]
*  the new republic. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4167.12s)]
*  She says to me, and at this point, I'm like, she thinks I'm a neocon or something, but [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4168.12s)]
*  she's calling me for like, what do we make of Trump? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4172.36s)]
*  And she goes, Trump's calling himself a nationalist. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4174.68s)]
*  She was like way offended. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4178.28s)]
*  And it was just prime and facial, like nationalism bad. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4179.28s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm a nationalist. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4182.28s)]
*  And she goes, she's not stupid. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4184.28s)]
*  And she goes, you're a nationalist? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4185.92s)]
*  I said, well, I don't know. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4187.64s)]
*  I think I am. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4189.16s)]
*  I mean, I like America. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4190.16s)]
*  I think the US government should work for America. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4191.16s)]
*  She was like horrified. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4193.14s)]
*  And I don't think I've ever spoken to her again. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4194.599999999999s)]
*  Why does that idea, which is non-threatening, it's not a Nazi idea, it's like a basic idea, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4197.64s)]
*  it was the founders idea that the US government should act on behalf of Americans. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4203.0s)]
*  Why is that offensive? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4206.88s)]
*  So offensive to some people. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4207.96s)]
*  What is that? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4208.96s)]
*  I'm going to tell my Mark Levin story because I like Mark a lot and I think he's one of [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4209.96s)]
*  the smartest guys in the Constitution. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4212.84s)]
*  Although I will say, I think we're opposed on every big topic dealing with Maggie. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4214.96s)]
*  President Trump just saying, because Mark is a neoliberal neocon. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4219.56s)]
*  And that's what Fox is, right? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4223.160000000001s)]
*  Which is different than populism nationally. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4224.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4226.4400000000005s)]
*  And I've always gotten along with Mark. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4228.24s)]
*  This is why neoliberals, this is why neoliberal neocons, the whole Fox apparatus, this is [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4230.04s)]
*  what the Murdochs are. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4234.48s)]
*  They're much, they're just a different, you know, Gore Vidal said it's just two sides [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4235.48s)]
*  of kind of the same coin to run the American empire. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4239.08s)]
*  Because American empire is run on neoliberal principles and neocon principles. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4241.5599999999995s)]
*  So Mark, when I kept saying nationalism and populism and nationalism, he calls me up, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4245.28s)]
*  and as you know, Mark, he goes, Bannon, he goes, you got to drop nationalism. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4249.599999999999s)]
*  And I go, this is 10 years ago, 12 years ago, I first joined it at Breitbart. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4253.799999999999s)]
*  And I go, I go, why? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4257.4s)]
*  He says, it's Americanism. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4258.719999999999s)]
*  And I go, no, Mark, it's actually nationalism. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4260.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4262.5599999999995s)]
*  And I try walking through, he goes, no, no, no, no, it's Americanism. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4263.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he puts out a book later, I think, Americanism, which talks about certain tenets [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4265.5599999999995s)]
*  of nationalism, but they don't want to use that phrase, I think, because of connotations [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4270.16s)]
*  that came from Europe in the 19th century. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4274.84s)]
*  And then obviously in the 20th century, I said, this is, this is completely different. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4277.2s)]
*  It is populist nationalism. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4281.04s)]
*  It is a populist movement that puts America first and American citizens first. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4282.68s)]
*  That's the big part of the nationalism they never get to. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4287.88s)]
*  That is what unites us. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4290.58s)]
*  So how could they see that as bad? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4291.58s)]
*  I'm honestly, 10 years in, I'm baffled by it. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4293.08s)]
*  Like, what's bad about that? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4295.6s)]
*  If you mention, if you mention that word, they just, they get lit up. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4296.72s)]
*  I have still many people today. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4300.0s)]
*  People accuse me, oh, in fact, Ben, and Ben Schabrism, one of the smartest guys in the [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4302.240000000001s)]
*  country, Ben said when I was running Breitbart, when he left, whether he left Arizona quarter, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4306.360000000001s)]
*  fired him is still a matter of debate, still a matter of debate. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4312.28s)]
*  Ben goes, I turned, I turned Breitbart into Trump Pravda, right? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4316.44s)]
*  But the populist nationalism and away from Andrew's court tennis. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4320.639999999999s)]
*  So listen, that is an ideological fight about nomenclature, which is very important and [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4324.04s)]
*  us going forward. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4328.639999999999s)]
*  But the tenets of it and what we're trying to do, I think is what you're seeing President [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4330.04s)]
*  Trump do. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4333.36s)]
*  We have a government apparatus of these people that when institutions carry on year after [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4334.36s)]
*  year after year and pass the baton and they control and you know, many of these people, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4341.24s)]
*  most of them come from middle class backgrounds and they're not coming just from elite. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4346.5199999999995s)]
*  No, they're not Rockefellers. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4349.84s)]
*  There are some Rockefellers and there's some, some nepo babies, but they're irrelevant. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4351.8s)]
*  Mainly just middle class people. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4356.04s)]
*  Strivers. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4357.36s)]
*  But they're in control of the greatest, most powerful apparatus on earth. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4358.36s)]
*  And you mentioned earlier today, the thought of going into war and actually killing people, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4362.76s)]
*  something that turns certain people on the power of right now. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4368.12s)]
*  And that's why I say tell people when you come to Washington, you can really feel it's [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4372.4800000000005s)]
*  a spiritual war because of the dark spectrum that hangs over this town. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4376.72s)]
*  Now that spiritual war manifests itself in money and power. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4380.4s)]
*  And you see so many people I've seen come here in Congress and in people I've known [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4384.72s)]
*  that come here and they get corrupted and they get corrupted because that basic human [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4388.96s)]
*  nature of being attracted to money and power is very tough. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4394.48s)]
*  And that's where in a situation now that people we admire, people we like, people we've known, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4399.679999999999s)]
*  we have to go to war with them. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4405.2s)]
*  This war against this apparatus is going to be as brutal as the war we're fighting in [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4406.879999999999s)]
*  the streets of Los Angeles today to make sure that actually Los Angeles is part of this [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4413.04s)]
*  American Republic because right now California is not, but the major cities in this country [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4417.759999999999s)]
*  led by Los Angeles and San Francisco are definitely not. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4422.6s)]
*  They're a totally different entity. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4425.320000000001s)]
*  I'm sad to hear you say that because the last thing I want to do is spend my day arguing [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4426.6s)]
*  with Ben Shapiro or Mark Levin. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4431.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, I agree with those guys on a lot and I know them, of course. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4433.080000000001s)]
*  I'm not mad at them personally even now. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4436.200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to fight with them. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4438.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4440.280000000001s)]
*  I want to fight with George Soros or something or Gavin Newsom. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4440.92s)]
*  But I feel like they are making it impossible. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4445.72s)]
*  This is my read, probably self-serving, but I feel like they are making it impossible [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4447.64s)]
*  to sit back in silence as they wreck the country. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4451.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4455.4s)]
*  And that fight, as important as that is, to me is a secondary tertiary fight right now. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4456.12s)]
*  Then the fight that we need you on and the fight we need you on, you have a unique historical [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4462.52s)]
*  understanding of the institutions of this town and the smarts. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4467.32s)]
*  We need a handful of smart people around President Trump. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4471.96s)]
*  They're saying this is the look, we put Cash and Bongino into FBI. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4475.4s)]
*  We've put Ellis in Radcliffe, the CIA. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4479.48s)]
*  We've put a handful of great people at DOJ. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4482.919999999999s)]
*  We've put Pete and a handful of great people at defense. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4485.16s)]
*  We've put Tulsi and Joe Kent and a handful of people at DNI. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4487.48s)]
*  It's not enough. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4490.12s)]
*  The apparatus still runs the deal. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4491.719999999999s)]
*  We are hanging on in a very tenuous shape. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4494.28s)]
*  We need to go to war. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4496.759999999999s)]
*  They want to go to war in Persia. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4499.08s)]

*  And I mean, take the sword out of the scabbard and throw away the scabbard. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4502.839999999999s)]

*  that, I mean, I think that would be really hard. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4519.4800000000005s)]

*  I think... [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4528.6s)]
*  First off, just the announcement of that, the intention of that would unmask. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4528.92s)]
*  Part of this is going through an unmasking. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4535.16s)]
*  Who's on our side and who's not on our side? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4537.16s)]

*  And we can go through a great unmasking. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4544.599999999999s)]
*  What they fear is sincerity because I'm hardly the smartest person in DC, well, not in DC, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4546.2s)]

*  And I don't think I'm like, you know, have like brilliant, cohesive philosophical ideas [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4553.72s)]
*  or anything like that. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4558.76s)]
*  I'm just sort of a bumbling, middle-aged, you know, hopefully try to be Christian person. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4559.639999999999s)]
*  But I'm totally sincere. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4565.56s)]
*  And that's why they hated MTG, who's also, you know... [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4567.8s)]
*  Marginal. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4571.64s)]
*  We've probably got the same SAT score, you know what I mean? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4572.76s)]
*  But she's not kidding. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4575.320000000001s)]
*  She's totally in that kind of... [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4577.400000000001s)]
*  What you see... [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4578.92s)]
*  In that chick way where they get mad and they just like start telling the truth. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4579.64s)]
*  What you see is what you get. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4582.52s)]
*  Only women do that. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4583.400000000001s)]
*  No, she... [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4585.0s)]
*  Look, she's central to MAGA. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4585.96s)]
*  I mean, what do you mean? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4587.240000000001s)]
*  She's been... [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4588.04s)]
*  She was written out today by Mark Levin. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4588.92s)]
*  I know. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4590.84s)]
*  She and I don't always agree on everything, but she's 100% MAGA. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4591.080000000001s)]
*  It's not even a question. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4594.360000000001s)]
*  That shows you the level they're prepared to go to. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4595.08s)]
*  No. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4597.16s)]
*  What you have is... [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4597.96s)]
*  Which is tough in this town to get is actually historical understanding of these institutions. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4600.2s)]
*  The only other person, and this would be great if you did it, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4607.0s)]
*  the only other person I know that has that is Bobby Kennedy. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4610.28s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy has that understanding, obviously, what his family's gone through. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4614.92s)]
*  But he, at a very deep level, he knows the interconnections. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4618.92s)]
*  Good friend of mine. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4621.72s)]
*  Seeing him tomorrow morning. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4622.5199999999995s)]
*  Steve Bannon, thank you for taking the time to do this. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4625.48s)]
*  I am grateful. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4627.8s)]
*  And Godspeed in this city. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4628.68s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4630.68s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4632.04s)]
*  I can't wait till you get your appointment. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4632.68s)]
*  Be the first interview on... [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4637.16s)]
*  Roar room after he gets it. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4638.6s)]
*  I'm not kidding when I get... [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4640.04s)]
*  Hey, I've had longer odds on things than this, so stand by. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4641.4s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4645.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4646.04s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4646.6s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4651.72s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4655.0s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4656.6s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4657.32s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4659.08s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4661.16s)]
*  with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4664.6s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4667.56s)]
*  That is totally wrong. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4672.04s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4673.96s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4675.320000000001s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4676.92s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4678.280000000001s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4679.400000000001s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4680.4400000000005s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that is true, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4681.8s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4685.08s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4686.76s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4690.4400000000005s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4691.16s)]
*  That way, you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4695.72s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFM6L6TopsM&t=4700.84s)]
