**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s)
*  Well, amazingly, we're just a few weeks from our nationwide tour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going coast to coast, the Atlantic to the Pacific and back, doing live shows [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  with big audiences, uncensorable, and bringing along very good friends of ours, our special [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  guests. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=15.56s)]
*  We hope to see you there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=16.56s)]
*  Tickets at TuckerCarlson.com. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=17.56s)]
*  We're hitting the road all of September. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=19.68s)]
*  Here's our latest episode with Rob Schneider. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=22.44s)]
*  So, I hate to start with this, but I read what looked like a family tragedy playing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=30.0s)]
*  out of the news, your daughter going after you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=51.24s)]
*  It's fun being a parent, isn't it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=53.92s)]
*  It can be hard. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=55.64s)]
*  What was that? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=58.2s)]
*  Well, I want to just tell my daughter, Elle, I love you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=59.6s)]
*  And I wish I was the father in my 20s that you needed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  And clearly I wasn't. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=76.0s)]
*  And I hope you can forgive me for my shortcomings. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=77.68s)]
*  I love you completely. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=80.2s)]
*  I love you entirely. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=81.92s)]
*  And I just want you to be well and happy with you and your beautiful baby, Lucky. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=84.0s)]
*  And I wish you the best. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=90.16s)]
*  I feel terrible. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  And I just want you to know that I don't take anything you say personally. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  I love you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  And I feel that God has gifted this moment and gifted me to be able to just tell you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=99.64s)]
*  I love you and I accept you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=106.56s)]
*  And I apologize for any of my shortcomings that I have. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=108.56s)]
*  And I wish for you that they heal and be well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=112.92s)]
*  And that you have everything that you want, including the dad that you want from me to be. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=117.76s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=121.96s)]
*  I'm here for you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=123.64s)]
*  I love you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  Whenever you need me, I'll be there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  And anything that you said, I don't take personally. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=127.48s)]
*  And if I could take away all your pain, I would gladly do it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=130.2s)]
*  And if I need to take the hit for you now, I'll do it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  And I'll do it again gladly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=136.76s)]
*  My heart is your home. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=138.72s)]
*  And a home is a place when you go there, they have to let you in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=140.4s)]
*  And I love you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry that you're having to deal with this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=145.84s)]
*  But this is a great opportunity because we can talk about families. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=148.68s)]
*  I mean, show me a perfect family out there and I'll be shocked. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=153.04s)]
*  But families, this is, you have to ask, like, is God, I'm a new Catholic. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=158.24s)]
*  God has presented this to me. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=166.2s)]
*  And I'm going to use it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to say that this is, when you have opportunities, like when you're being [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=169.92s)]
*  attacked or you feel like what the world is caving in on, like a lot of people feel [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=174.16s)]
*  now, whether it's financially, whether it's politically, people are separating, and especially [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=181.84s)]
*  with people that are dealing with addiction and families that are dealing with addiction. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=186.88s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  It's really tough on the family. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=192.46s)]
*  And it really is crushing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=194.68s)]
*  And so if we're able to discuss and talk about that and help heal people and help, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=196.36s)]
*  they give them the opportunity to let them know that this is common and that there are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  roots you can do to heal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=207.68s)]
*  And for people suffering and families suffering from addiction, and unfortunately it is bigger [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=210.0s)]
*  now than any time in my life, we need to have a path for healing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=216.52s)]
*  And part of that path is not just getting clean, but I was talking to my good friend [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=223.36s)]
*  Dr. Drupinski, and he said, we also, addiction, people have to deal with resentment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=228.68s)]
*  That's a really important thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=236.22000000000003s)]
*  And I'm glad this has all been brought up because resentment has to be addressed and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=239.22000000000003s)]
*  managed to help keep the person sober. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=244.3s)]
*  Families who are dealing with addiction, it's really important. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Because resentment, resentful people use it as a way to justify bad behavior and any [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=250.48s)]
*  kind of behavior and not taking responsibility for their own actions, blaming others, and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=257.92s)]
*  in the destructive behavior, including even using again. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=264.08s)]
*  So it's important that we heal that, address that, so that doesn't become this destructive [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=269.8s)]
*  thing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=275.56s)]
*  And part of really staying sober and remaining sober and getting back to a place of happiness. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=276.56s)]
*  So when your daughter attacks you in public, how hard is it not to, you didn't make any [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  excuses or blame her or attack back. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=287.44s)]
*  How hard is that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=292.44s)]
*  If you love somebody completely, you just, you know, I love her and all I want for her [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=294.4s)]
*  is to be happy and to heal from this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=300.08s)]
*  And I really feel there's anything that I can, you know, I apologize completely for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=304.12s)]
*  and accept responsibility for not being the parent that I am now with my new kids. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=311.06s)]
*  She didn't get that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=316.08s)]
*  And I missed a lot. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=317.08s)]
*  And as a parent, you're going to pay for everything you miss. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=318.08s)]
*  And I thought that just because I was starting my career at the time and I thought, well, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=321.36s)]
*  I'm able to provide this, this school, this, this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=325.44s)]
*  How old were you? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=327.68s)]
*  I was 26. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=329.32s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=330.32s)]
*  So. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=331.32s)]
*  And got divorced. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=332.32s)]
*  About a year later. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=333.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=335.08s)]
*  And she's got a great mom. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=336.08s)]
*  It's a great job. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=337.08s)]
*  It's the best job she could, but it's hard, you know, not having a fractured home from [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=338.52s)]
*  the start is not, is not the ideal thing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=342.52s)]
*  So it's difficult. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  And then, and then I, and I, and I get it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=348.44s)]
*  And I really feel, I feel like, look, I'm here now and whatever I can do for you, I'll [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=352.36s)]
*  be the father that you need me to be now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  And I love you and thank God that I'm here now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=361.88s)]
*  And that if there's something that you need from me, my heart, my, you know, is open. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=365.44s)]
*  So and it's okay though, you know, I feel like it's a good opportunity. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=372.4s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing when God presents you with something, you know, when God says to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=376.32s)]
*  you, you know, here, you know, when the enemy, when the, when people are like, when you have [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=380.96s)]
*  attacks in your life, you know, when you, when they say, hand it over to God, you know, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=387.96s)]
*  tell me and just hand some of it over. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=391.8s)]
*  I mean, you got to hand it over. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=393.32s)]
*  And when you do, you will have peace. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  You will have peace. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=397.92s)]
*  And there's nothing the world can do to you when you have God. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=399.68s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=402.44s)]
*  They can't touch you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=403.6s)]
*  My most important relationship is with God. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=404.92s)]
*  And if that's good, they can't touch me. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=407.12s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=409.2s)]
*  My, my, you know, wonderful priest, you know, was, talked to me about this and about like, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=410.2s)]
*  if you got a good relationship with God, then you're set. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=416.8s)]
*  But when you hand it over, you got to really hand it over. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=418.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  Can you take it? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  And like, okay, God, I need your help because you'll be, you'll be tested in this world. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  They go like, yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=426.36s)]
*  I said, I, because I feel I'm in a good place. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=427.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  We have temptations to want to, to, to get angry, to strike back. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  That's a real temptation for people. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=443.56s)]
*  What's an overwhelming temptation? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=445.92s)]
*  It is. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, our job, what we need to do as a parent is to love and accept and be tolerant [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=449.23999999999995s)]
*  and forgive. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=455.91999999999996s)]

*  and to just have compassion for what people are going through, especially in your family. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=466.44s)]
*  And to know that it's not about me. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=471.12s)]
*  It's about the pain that they're suffering and how can we heal it? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=473.76s)]
*  And we're seeing a lot of that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=476.91999999999996s)]

*  And the difference is when we were kids, if somebody had like an addiction to a particular [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  narcotic or something, you know, unless it was heroin, there's cocaine and speed and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  other stuff and crystal meth around the eighties. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=501.0s)]

*  We have families now who are dealing with a kind of, a different kind of healing because [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=508.76s)]
*  they've lost their child. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=515.96s)]
*  We have these porous borders now and we have the thing talking about, you know, for the, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=517.88s)]
*  the Democrats who want to change the voting habits of whatever remain power and ever in [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=524.36s)]
*  every state. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=528.96s)]
*  It's really an ugly thing because what they're really doing is they're just bringing in death [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=530.14s)]
*  and misery because the people who are coming into the border are also being abused. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=534.02s)]
*  It needs to be a, I'm all for immigration. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=538.18s)]
*  It has to be legal. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=540.18s)]

*  just, it takes your breath away. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=567.5400000000001s)]

*  This woman came up to me, said, hi, I'm, you know, I really appreciate what you've been [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=573.62s)]

*  And at the airport waiting for our bags and I was just taking a cup of coffee waiting. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=579.4200000000001s)]
*  And this is in Phoenix where I live now. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=583.94s)]
*  We started talking a little bit and I was flattered by that. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=588.26s)]
*  So it's nice when people say something nice about you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=590.74s)]
*  And then I said, so how was your, where'd you come back? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=593.46s)]
*  He said, oh, Hawaii. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=595.98s)]
*  And I said, oh, it was beautiful. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=596.98s)]
*  She said, yeah, but it wasn't a happy occasion. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=599.1s)]
*  And I said, what? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=602.78s)]
*  He said, oh, I was spreading my son, my 17 year old son's ashes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=603.78s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=609.58s)]
*  She said, he wasn't an addict. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=612.54s)]
*  He wasn't, he just was a dabbler and he didn't realize what he just thought. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=613.82s)]
*  He just thought it was cocaine and he's gone. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=617.02s)]
*  There's no rehab. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=621.34s)]
*  There's no getting better. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=622.5s)]

*  They're gone. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=629.54s)]
*  And this family is crushed. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=630.54s)]
*  But this woman has such grace about her. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=632.6999999999999s)]
*  It's like, whew. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=635.26s)]
*  You know, thank God has to carry people at the moments like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=637.54s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=642.9s)]
*  How did you respond when you saw that you were being attacked? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=644.5799999999999s)]
*  What was your first 24 hours like? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=647.8199999999999s)]
*  You feel hurt, obviously. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  And you check within. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  But then as soon as you get out of me and get into like, well, what is, how can we do [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=656.5799999999999s)]
*  this? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=663.62s)]
*  First of all, I was like kind of stunned by it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=664.62s)]
*  No warning at all. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=667.38s)]
*  No. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=668.38s)]
*  Then you got like, well, I love you and I want you to be, I can't get into the specifics [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=669.38s)]
*  of like what she's going through now, but obviously, you know, I want it to be happy [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=677.62s)]
*  and well and to heal. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=684.3s)]
*  And to heal means not just, you know, doing something to make yourself feel better, but [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=688.18s)]
*  to really get to some of the issues that you need to do. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=695.14s)]
*  And to just, like, I love you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=699.78s)]
*  And if you take yourself out of the equation and you say hand it over to God, you have [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=703.86s)]
*  to. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=707.58s)]
*  Because if you make it about me and what this is like. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=708.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=710.54s)]
*  You know, I have an adult child now. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=711.54s)]
*  She's going to have to figure things out. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=712.54s)]
*  And God bless her. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=714.14s)]
*  And she's had a tremendous success with her career. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=715.14s)]
*  And I want her to have that peace, that peace that I've found and that love that I've had. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=719.78s)]
*  I'm grateful for this situation because maybe this is what it takes for her to heal and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=728.3399999999999s)]
*  for whatever, for other people to know about this and so that they can reach out and they [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=733.6999999999999s)]
*  can know that to not take it personal, but go, what can I do? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=739.06s)]
*  How can I love? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=742.5s)]
*  How can I heal? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=743.5s)]
*  What would God do here? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=744.5s)]
*  How could I work through this? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=745.74s)]
*  How could I use this as an introduction for her to get closer to God? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=747.3s)]
*  So maybe there's all this potential there. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=751.3199999999999s)]
*  There's also the potential to realize that when you are attacked in the media by anything [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=753.38s)]
*  is to know this isn't, you cannot take this in. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=758.66s)]
*  And if you have, I mean, it was a beautiful thing, my wife and I, Patricia, just the best [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=763.54s)]
*  thing that ever happened to me, that God gave me was this. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=768.62s)]
*  We never did the rosary together in bed. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  And we never did the rosary together ever. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=775.9799999999999s)]
*  So we were in bed the other night before I flew out here and let's do it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=777.54s)]
*  And we didn't even remember, no, she didn't remember exactly how to do it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=782.28s)]
*  And I'm a new Catholic. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=786.4s)]
*  So we're literally like going over each bead and doing Hail Mary's and then Our Fathers [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=787.68s)]
*  and then what's this bead for? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  And I will tell you, it was beautiful. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=796.52s)]
*  And the peace that I felt after that and the whole next day was really the power of prayer. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=799.6s)]
*  And so as I hope, I'm praying for my daughter and I hope that people will pray for her. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=806.54s)]
*  So even in the midst of that, you found peace. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=812.52s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=814.8199999999999s)]
*  And not right away, but I did find, I mean, the peace is there for you. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=815.8199999999999s)]
*  When you accept God and have God, you hand it over to Him, you got to really do it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=820.38s)]
*  And I said, God, I know there's a purpose here. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=826.0999999999999s)]
*  There's got to be something. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=828.4s)]
*  And as soon as I took it out of me and like my heart, my needs, my hurt, my injury and [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=829.78s)]
*  this is, this cannot be what this is about. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=835.78s)]
*  This has to be how to heal something and how to maybe bring this up for other people and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=838.74s)]
*  other families that are dealing with similar things. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=842.9s)]
*  And some good is going to come from it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=845.74s)]
*  It already has. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=848.3s)]
*  How did you get to this place? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=849.3s)]
*  I mean, describe how you got here to facing, I mean, I got to say probably a tougher moment [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=850.6999999999999s)]
*  than like a diagnosis of illness. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=858.02s)]
*  Like having a conflict with a child is the hardest thing I would say for a parent and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=860.48s)]
*  yet you're at peace. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=864.02s)]
*  So how did you get here? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=865.02s)]
*  Well, it's a long story. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=868.46s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing where, you know, where I, I felt close to Jesus Christ when I was [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=869.78s)]
*  a young boy and then I strayed. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=877.9s)]
*  But the thing about Jesus is he'll only let you go so far. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=882.22s)]
*  And all that stuff was necessary for me to learn and come back. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=886.1999999999999s)]
*  But he was always kind of there in the back of my, in the back there, like he was never [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=889.6999999999999s)]
*  left. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=893.38s)]
*  And I think through getting lost and into the world and getting, thinking about my career [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=895.7s)]
*  and this and that and, and the frustrations of it and thinking too much about what other [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=904.7s)]
*  people think about you and like where your position is in show business and how much [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=915.82s)]
*  money you make and where you are. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=920.14s)]
*  Are you on the A list? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=921.7s)]
*  Are you off list? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=922.7s)]
*  I'm making movies. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=924.5400000000001s)]
*  It's just a, it's a hamster wheel. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=925.5400000000001s)]
*  And I think the more important thing is to, and what I think what our culture is suffering [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=929.1800000000001s)]
*  from now is this in the social media hamster wheel we're on and their politics and our [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=935.6600000000001s)]
*  political parties are not helping the mental health of Americans. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=941.58s)]
*  So there's today's understatement. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=946.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=948.26s)]
*  So there, if we could step back and, and find a piece, more peaceful way to exist and to [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=949.26s)]
*  not live in fear. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=955.62s)]
*  And I, I stopped being fearful about, cause once you do get attacked, like the, when the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=956.78s)]
*  pharmaceutical industry attacked me for what I thought was just the basic humanity. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=963.46s)]
*  And to even question it was you destroying your career. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=977.98s)]
*  I was like questioning it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=991.94s)]
*  I thought we live in the freest country in the world. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=993.34s)]
*  Well, you're allowed to talk about politics and you can be, you know, you used to be, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=995.78s)]
*  and you can talk about things like that. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1002.4200000000001s)]
*  You could talk about, you know, how the United States army spent $25,000 for a toilet, which [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1004.3s)]
*  is, you know, or a hammer. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1008.8599999999999s)]
*  But if you talk about the underpinnings of power, if you talk about the, an industry [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1011.14s)]
*  that is the real drug cartel, we're not talking about the Mexican drug cartel, that's just [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1016.0s)]
*  a measly $10 billion a year. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1020.54s)]
*  If you're talking about the pharmaceutical industry, $300 billion here, you're talking [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1022.8599999999999s)]
*  about power. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1028.26s)]
*  You're talking about an industry. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1029.26s)]
*  You're talking about the real drug cartel that pays for the biggest donors to not just [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1032.18s)]
*  federal legislature, the legislators, but state legislators. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1037.94s)]
*  They not only, they not only control the medical establishment, they also control the medical [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1042.98s)]
*  boards that recommend things and that recommend us the, the, what, what, what Americans are [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1052.8600000000001s)]
*  mandated to get, children are. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1058.38s)]
*  And then when you open your eyes to it and you realize that something that was astounding [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1060.82s)]
*  to me that Robert Kennedy talks about, and he's one of the few who has the courage to [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1067.5s)]
*  talk about it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1072.3s)]
*  And thank you for letting him talk about this on your, on your show. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1073.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1089.22s)]
*  So, let's start doing this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1090.22s)]
*  Imagine going to your computer, looking at your entire browsing history on the web, everything [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1091.22s)]
*  you've looked at. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1095.98s)]
*  Now, imagine hitting print and then signing your full name at the bottom, maybe with your [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1096.98s)]
*  social security number, printing out that browsing history with your name on it and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1101.46s)]
*  nailing it to the front door of say your house for everybody in the world to see. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1105.44s)]
*  Maybe that'd be fine. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1110.38s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1112.18s)]
*  And while you're at it, actually take a copy of that same list of everything you've looked [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1113.18s)]
*  at on the internet and post it in the break room at work. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1115.82s)]
*  And then in fact, go farther than that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1120.02s)]
*  Blow that up and put it on a billboard over a major highway on your commute to work. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1121.66s)]
*  Here's everything I've been looking at on the internet. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1126.06s)]
*  Would you want to do that? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1128.7s)]
*  You don't have to be a creep to think maybe that's not something I'd want to do. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1130.82s)]
*  But in effect, that's what you're already doing every single day, unless you already [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1135.22s)]
*  use the sponsor of this video, ExpressVPN. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1139.78s)]
*  You are allowing all of your online activity to become public. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1143.1s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1147.98s)]
*  Because internet service providers can see every website you have ever visited. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1149.22s)]
*  Yes, even if you're in incognito or private browsing mode, that doesn't really work. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1153.26s)]
*  And in the United States, your internet service provider can then sell your data to whomever [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1159.46s)]
*  they please, including the government. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1163.34s)]
*  And they do, by the way. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1165.68s)]
*  So what can you do about that? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1168.18s)]
*  Well, you can do what people in our office do, particularly when we're abroad, but also [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1169.9s)]
*  when we're here. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1174.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's encrypt your online activity before it even reaches the internet service provider [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1175.7s)]
*  so no one can see it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1179.5s)]
*  It's private. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  Privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1182.18s)]
*  So keep it close. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1183.98s)]
*  We use ExpressVPN to do that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1186.48s)]
*  That's our internet provider. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1188.26s)]
*  Our internet provider cannot see what we're doing on the internet because we use ExpressVPN. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1190.7s)]
*  They can't record it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1196.42s)]
*  They can't share it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1197.42s)]
*  They can't sell our browsing history because they never have it to begin with. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1198.42s)]
*  Why don't they have it to begin with? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1201.6200000000001s)]
*  ExpressVPN reroutes our online activity through secure servers and changes our IP address [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1203.78s)]
*  and makes you more anonymous to apps and websites trying to track us. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1209.66s)]
*  It'll do the same for you. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1212.58s)]
*  What we like about it is it's so easy to use, even if you're not a tech genius. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1214.34s)]
*  You tap one button on whatever device you're using, whether it's your phone, your laptop, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1218.8999999999999s)]
*  your tablet, your desktop, and you know that your privacy is secure. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1222.5s)]
*  Once again, privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1227.58s)]
*  You can't be free unless you have privacy. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1230.78s)]
*  And if you want to start reclaiming your privacy, do yourself a favor and use our special link [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1233.58s)]
*  to get three months of ExpressVPN for free. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1237.42s)]
*  Just go to ExpressVPN.com. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1239.78s)]
*  That's ExpressVPN.com. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1243.7s)]
*  And vaccines or drugs, either you have a choice for your own body autonomy, your own freedom [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1250.42s)]
*  of choice when there's risks, to take risks, or if you don't have that freedom to avoid [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1256.3s)]
*  risks, then you don't have, then you have tyranny. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1261.78s)]
*  Then you're a slave. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1265.9s)]
*  Someone owns your body and can make you hurt yourself. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1267.38s)]
*  And then somebody could shut down that same group, can shut down the world. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1269.42s)]
*  And they did. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1272.7s)]
*  So what happened when you made these points, which I think any rational person, even people [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1274.2s)]
*  who disagree with you, say, those are reasonable points. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1279.18s)]
*  I mean, maybe I've got evidence that shows you're wrong. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1280.9s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1283.68s)]
*  But those are not, you're not making crazy points. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1284.68s)]
*  We're supposed to be, the idea and what happened during COVID was the idea was like, you're [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1286.74s)]
*  supposed to discuss things in a free society and debate and then take the best of those [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1291.5s)]
*  ideas. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1297.94s)]
*  And let's see which ones are evidence based. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1298.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1300.22s)]
*  Use the evidence. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1301.22s)]
*  What happened was we were taking people like Dr. Bhutakarya and Peter McCullough and, you [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1302.22s)]
*  know, we say, well, this is evidence here, Dr. Corey. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1306.74s)]
*  And well, this is evidence. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1310.06s)]
*  Well, yeah, but you're not allowed to use that evidence. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1311.06s)]
*  That evidence, no. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1313.0s)]
*  The drug companies don't want to see that evidence. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1314.02s)]
*  Instead of adjusting the, instead of adjusting the, what should happen, because based on [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1316.8s)]
*  evidence, what they did was they just denounced people who brought the evidence and said, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1321.12s)]
*  well, those people, let's demonize them. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1325.44s)]
*  Let's denounce them or whatever. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1327.72s)]
*  And so when I first brought this up, I was like, you know, I did a commercial with Aaron [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1329.22s)]
*  Rogers who coincidentally, for State Farm, who coincidentally became vaccine hesitant [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1334.32s)]
*  himself. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1339.04s)]
*  And rightfully so, realizing. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1340.04s)]
*  What a good guy he is. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1342.24s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1343.48s)]
*  But realizing the human immune system, this is before he knew any of this. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1344.48s)]
*  So he cleared himself. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1346.72s)]
*  He had nothing. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1347.72s)]
*  He never talked to me about this after. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1348.72s)]
*  We did a commercial for State Farm and he hasn't done any since, since he's been vaccine [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1350.24s)]
*  hesitant. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1355.6s)]
*  But the human immune system, which has been proved true, is like, you can't trust the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1356.94s)]
*  human immune system that's been working for millions or hundreds of thousands of years. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1360.32s)]
*  Why would you do that when you could take this drug that we just made yesterday at warp [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1363.84s)]
*  speed? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1368.16s)]
*  So it's just kind of a weird logic. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1369.72s)]
*  So I came out and then so I got attacked by the goons. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1371.3999999999999s)]
*  And you know, this is 10 years ago when like a few people can attack, you know, a company [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1374.6399999999999s)]
*  like State Farm and say this is dangerous, blah, blah, blah, you know, and then then [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1379.6s)]
*  they could think it's a lot of people. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1383.76s)]
*  And then they took, you know, so I got slammed in the media as this anti-vaxxer, which is [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1385.8s)]
*  a very interesting term, anti-vaxxer. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1390.2s)]
*  You can complain about the, you know, the Boeing 737 Max airplane, because it is dangerous. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1392.02s)]
*  We did have an engine fall out. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1397.8999999999999s)]
*  A piece did fall out. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1399.12s)]
*  You can say, you know what, there's a problem with these, these problems. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1400.28s)]
*  Nobody says these are anti-planer. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1403.32s)]
*  This guy over here is anti-airplane. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1405.6399999999999s)]
*  We're talking about an airplane. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1406.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't talk bad about an airplane. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1408.84s)]
*  But if you, if you question any of the 72 different doses of 16 vaccines before the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1410.48s)]
*  age of six, then you're an anti-vaxxer. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1415.8799999999999s)]
*  So anti-vaxxer, that's an interesting term. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1417.68s)]
*  Also like I say this in my stand-up act, they said, you know, if a woman doesn't want to [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1419.8799999999999s)]
*  have sex with you, that doesn't make her anti-dick. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1423.52s)]
*  She's just anti your dick. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1425.76s)]
*  You may be open to a lot of other, you know, members, but yours specifically, she doesn't, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1428.84s)]
*  it doesn't make her anti all. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1434.84s)]
*  So you make. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  By the way, it doesn't make her a bad person. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1437.1599999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't make her a bad person. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1440.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1442.24s)]
*  So, so we went from, so, but anyway, the attack happens and then you, when you survive an attack, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1443.24s)]
*  that's the most interesting part. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1450.4399999999998s)]
*  Cause anybody can get attacked. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1451.72s)]
*  It's like, do you cow? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you buckle under? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1455.1999999999998s)]
*  Or do you just go, you know, I'm still here. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1457.0s)]
*  I've survived. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1462.0s)]
*  Now what? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1463.0s)]
*  And now, and I'm one of those guys who as a little person and I, you know, they say [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1464.0s)]
*  on the internet, it's like five three. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1470.16s)]
*  I'm just five five, by the way. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1471.56s)]
*  I don't know why that matters. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1473.36s)]
*  Only my wife says, only men care about that stuff. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1474.52s)]
*  You never hear a woman say I'm five, six and a half. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1476.72s)]
*  They never say that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1479.28s)]
*  Men, you're egos. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1480.28s)]
*  You got to have five, four and a half. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1481.28s)]
*  Who cares about the half? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1482.64s)]
*  But I'm one of those guys, like when you're little, you got to defend yourself. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  I remember fighting a super nice guy. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1488.96s)]
*  He's a pilot now. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1492.44s)]
*  Bob McPeak and I got, and he was like six, three, great guy. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1493.44s)]
*  He lives in Florida. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1496.24s)]
*  Love, lovely guy. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1497.24s)]
*  He lives in a neighbor. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1498.24s)]
*  We're friends, but we got into a fight and I go like, okay. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1499.24s)]
*  As kids. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1501.04s)]
*  As kids. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1502.04s)]
*  We're like, you know, like, you know, junior high and you know, we're going to fight and [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1503.04s)]
*  I'm looking at going like, this guy is going to clean my clock. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1505.68s)]
*  The only way I'm going to get out of this is if I just get him in the nose, just whack [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1508.04s)]
*  him. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1511.84s)]
*  So just wait for it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1513.24s)]
*  Wait for it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1514.24s)]
*  Wait for it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1515.24s)]
*  And it's, you know, a lot of guys fighting. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1516.24s)]
*  It's like this, you know, because they think the bigger the swing, the better. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1517.76s)]
*  But the guys who know about fighting, especially Filipinos who changed fighting, we can talk [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1520.8s)]
*  about that. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1525.08s)]
*  It's all in the shoulder. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1526.08s)]
*  It's just right here. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1527.72s)]
*  And it's the short one that's got, and use the hip and you turn. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1528.72s)]
*  And then, so I just, I waited and I go, pop. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1532.24s)]
*  And it was like, that was it. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1534.52s)]
*  Fight over. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1536.1999999999998s)]
*  And I said, oof, I got out of that one. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1537.1999999999998s)]
*  So, but you have to defend yourself. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1538.1999999999998s)]
*  And so I just felt like when you survive and you get a little, you go, I got to be crafty [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1541.12s)]
*  about this, but I'm not going to bow to this pressure. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1545.28s)]
*  And I never have. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1548.04s)]
*  And I've never apologized or rebutted it because I'm right about it. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1549.4399999999998s)]
*  And then, and I'm going to continue to believe these people because the health of American [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  children is more important than my, me making Deuce Bigelow 4, you know? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  So I don't, you know, whatever. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1560.8999999999999s)]
*  But we're going to, we have to continue to fight to get Americans healthy, mentally healthy, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1562.36s)]
*  physically healthy. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1566.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1567.8s)]
*  And to also have awareness for all our people about how they can learn to get healthy. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1569.48s)]
*  Because if you go off the food pyramid, you're going to be fat, obese, you're going to have [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1575.96s)]
*  diabetes. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1579.84s)]
*  My dad had diabetes, which is what I'm concerned about my children. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1580.84s)]
*  And you know, and I know that was one of the things that was my daughter. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1584.36s)]
*  But Ozempix is going to cure diabetes for all time, right? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1588.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, that is a dangerous drug that we don't even understand the full implications of what [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  that drug is going to do. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1598.32s)]
*  And I've just heard, you know, I was just talking to Dr. Drupinski about that just the [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1599.66s)]
*  other night. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1603.92s)]
*  That's a dangerous drug. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1604.92s)]
*  Get off that drug. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1606.34s)]
*  There's never such a thing as an easy cheat. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1608.24s)]
*  You can get off, I would just tell Americans, get off sugar and things that turn into sugar, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1612.16s)]
*  grains, and get off processed oils, seed oils, anything. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1618.12s)]
*  It's sunflower, sunflower oil, all that seed oil you got to get rid of because it's toxic, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1622.8799999999999s)]
*  it's rancid, and it will make you sick and it causes diseases. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1628.04s)]
*  And if you look specifically since the processed foods, and the only reason they put it in [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1631.48s)]
*  is so it doesn't rot on the shelf. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1635.24s)]
*  When you have something that doesn't rot and go bad, doesn't grow mold, if mold says, I [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1637.68s)]
*  don't want any of that, well, then don't put it in your body. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1642.0s)]
*  And it's just seed oil, palm oil, all this stuff. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1644.84s)]
*  It's not real food. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1647.12s)]
*  It's just to keep it on the shelf so it doesn't rot. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1648.44s)]
*  So that all that stuff, we got to start learning. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1652.44s)]
*  That's what's interesting is the liberals are attacking what they can attack. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1655.24s)]
*  The problem with vaccines and the problem with is they think they could do something [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1662.16s)]
*  so that they do it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1667.06s)]
*  And it's the same thing with choosing a particular gas. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1668.06s)]
*  We can be choosing CO2. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1672.44s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1674.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what's causing the warming of the planet. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1675.1200000000001s)]
*  Not the fact that there's a giant fireball that we're circling around, but it's the gas. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1676.92s)]
*  It's you cooking and gardening. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1682.0s)]
*  That's what's causing it and cows farting. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1684.08s)]
*  So it's a lunacy. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1687.84s)]
*  But going back, just because you think you could do something, doesn't mean you should [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1689.6599999999999s)]
*  do it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1693.56s)]
*  The scarlet fever killed more people than smallpox and tuberculosis. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1695.56s)]
*  But you don't see a scarlet fever. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1701.8s)]
*  There's no scarlet fever vaccine and you don't see it rampant around the world. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  Nobody takes a tuberculosis vaccine, but you don't see it rampant around. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1711.32s)]
*  So they're doing these other ones because they can do something. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1715.52s)]
*  The measles, you can all look it up. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1718.4399999999998s)]
*  It's in my book. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1722.36s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1723.8s)]
*  Speak your mind, America. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1724.8s)]
*  Thankless. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1727.8s)]
*  I mean, obvious plug. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1728.8s)]
*  Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1731.0s)]
*  So because they could do something, like they put in the measles vaccine in 1961, and by [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1733.32s)]
*  that time, all of the deaths from measles had disappeared. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1739.48s)]
*  They just literally was not in body 61, and yet they put this in. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1745.0s)]
*  Because what really, and you can go to the CDC to look it up, what made the difference [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1748.3600000000001s)]
*  with human health, what changed was the fact that people weren't living in squalor, toilets, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1751.96s)]
*  sanitation. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1758.52s)]
*  So what happened was all the success of sanitation, which increased people's life expectancies, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1759.52s)]
*  made people healthy. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1766.24s)]
*  That is what saved society and cleaned up society, literally toilets, sanitation, drinking [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1767.64s)]
*  water and nutrition. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1773.44s)]
*  But vaccine mythology, vaccines piggybacked on the success of that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1775.0400000000002s)]
*  And that's why we're dealing with this now. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1779.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's interesting because the big killers, cholera, bubonic plague, are really [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1780.6000000000001s)]
*  diseases of squalor. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1789.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, people were living in the 19th century, in the early 20th century, they were literally, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1790.96s)]
*  they didn't have a clean water source. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1796.2s)]
*  That literally was like animals defecating in the same places as their water source. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1797.88s)]
*  Right, or people defecating. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1803.28s)]
*  And people, yeah, so it was all going. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1804.88s)]
*  I remember there was, you know, Anders, who's, you know, the writer of, co-writer of Marx, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1806.56s)]
*  his father was an industrialist and he was in 1857 in Manchester, England. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1814.6000000000001s)]
*  He was walking around and he described the people there as white ghosts. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1818.24s)]
*  Even the common cold, he knew would wipe these people out. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1823.48s)]
*  So that is an important, you know, getting that sanitation and clean drinking water and [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1829.48s)]
*  cleaning things up is what really made it. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1836.24s)]
*  So you sort of waved to, I beg your pardon, my question, because you don't want to talk [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1837.92s)]
*  about yourself, but the effect of saying what you did about health, like what, what, like [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1843.76s)]
*  did that affect your job prospects? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1849.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1851.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1853.12s)]
*  I mean, I got a call from a friend of mine who's a CEO of a fortune 500 company. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1854.12s)]
*  I don't have a lot of those, by the way, you know, but he called me and I was in Boston [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1858.0s)]
*  and I just got off and it was the big whole state farm affair that happened. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1862.12s)]
*  And I just got off stage and I was kind of still shaken by the thing because I'd never [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1865.9199999999998s)]
*  been like attacked like by like every newspaper and all this stuff and the internet was new [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1869.52s)]
*  and like, and you know, I was still a working actor at the time making, making movies and [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1873.68s)]
*  stuff. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1879.84s)]
*  My friend called me and he said, listen, you're really famous now. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1881.76s)]
*  You're just a nuisance right now. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1887.4399999999998s)]
*  But if you hurt them, if you cost them money, you will never work again. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1890.0s)]
*  And these companies will sue, not just you, they'll sue these other places to make sure [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1896.1999999999998s)]
*  that you never work again. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1900.32s)]
*  And I said, but I said, but I'm right about this. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1903.4399999999998s)]
*  And he says, he said, somebody's got to stand up. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1906.28s)]
*  He said, you have, and he said this to me. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1908.76s)]
*  You have a daughter. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1910.2s)]
*  Is it fair that she has to do this fight too? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1912.6000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, whoa, that took me out of my knees. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1916.0s)]
*  That's very heavy. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1920.92s)]
*  It is. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1922.8400000000001s)]
*  It was just to clarify, was this, was this a friend offering you constructive advice [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1923.8400000000001s)]
*  or is this someone threatening you or both? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1928.8400000000001s)]
*  Maybe it was a really good friend who was giving me advice that he thought. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1932.28s)]
*  Obviously somebody had talked to him and, or, or he just knew enough to know that this [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1937.1599999999999s)]
*  is what's happening because that's the world that he travels in. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1940.8s)]
*  He's a really good guy and, and a dear friend. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1943.56s)]
*  And I think he was trying to just help me from what he knew could happen. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1946.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1952.4799999999998s)]
*  You want to continue. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1953.4799999999998s)]
*  I like to continue my habit. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1954.84s)]
*  I have a, I have an addiction of keeping wanting to keep my family eating and sleeping indoors [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1956.08s)]
*  in private school. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1961.04s)]
*  Nice. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1963.64s)]
*  I have a car with the charger in my house. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1964.64s)]
*  I'd like to keep that. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1967.28s)]
*  I like to keep having, going out and eating a couple nights a week and maybe traveling [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1968.28s)]
*  once a year with the kids in the front of the plane. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1973.8s)]
*  I have my habits that I want to continue. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1976.64s)]
*  And, but at the same time, I said, you have to be, and I would just tell other people, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1979.0s)]
*  you have to be smart about this and, and, and questioning things and that we have to [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1984.08s)]
*  stand up because to not stand up and speak, it's dangerous to stand up and speak. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1988.92s)]
*  And it's going to cost you money. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1993.04s)]
*  It's going to cost you money if you stand up and speak your mind, if you stand up. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1994.48s)]
*  But when you knowingly go along with something that you know is false, that's going to cost [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=1998.72s)]
*  you more. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2004.12s)]
*  And that's something in our society, we have to go by evidence. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2005.2s)]
*  We have to, we have to just confront these lies. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2008.2s)]
*  We can't continue or we're going to have a nation of lies. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2011.2s)]
*  And I have people that call me. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2013.8s)]
*  I have a... [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2014.96s)]
*  Thank you for saying that. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2015.96s)]
*  I think everything you said is true and important to say. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2016.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2020.24s)]
*  One of the things you really can't live without are antibiotics. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2021.24s)]
*  They are life-saving. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2024.68s)]
*  Get an infection, you need antibiotics or you could die. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2025.68s)]
*  But one of the things a lot of us have learned over the last few years is that most of our [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2029.36s)]
*  antibiotics come from outside the country. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2032.96s)]
*  So that means to stay alive, many of us are depending on a supply chain from China. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2036.14s)]
*  So if you're in a family or people around you, you care about, just remember that supply [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2042.68s)]
*  chain from China could be the thing keeping them alive. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2048.44s)]
*  What if something went wrong with the supply chain from China? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2053.36s)]
*  Well, we don't have to imagine that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2055.16s)]
*  We just saw that during COVID, the lunacy of COVID. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2056.28s)]
*  Foreign supply chains collapsed in some cases, leaving American consumers without products [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2060.28s)]
*  they needed. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2065.88s)]
*  Products as simple as toilet paper, machine parts and potentially antibiotics. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2066.88s)]
*  So this is something we're thinking about. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2071.36s)]
*  You're not crazy. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2073.0s)]
*  You're not some radical prepper to want to have a steady supply of life-saving medicine [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2074.2s)]
*  in case something went wrong. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2079.64s)]
*  We spent a lot of time thinking about this because you need to. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2080.8s)]
*  You need an emergency supply, of course, of water, food, everyone knows that, but also [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2085.74s)]
*  medication. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2091.16s)]
*  And here's the part you can do right now. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2092.16s)]
*  There's a company that can do this for you. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2094.24s)]
*  It's called Jace Medical. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2096.0s)]
*  You can get a Jace case from Jace Medical. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2097.0s)]
*  Super simple. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2100.12s)]
*  You can get a pack of essential antibiotics to treat a long list of bacterial illnesses, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2101.12s)]
*  including UTIs, respiratory infections, skin infections, a lot of other common, potentially [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2104.88s)]

*  called me and said, I wish I could say what you say because I agree with you. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2160.48s)]
*  I agree with everything you're saying. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2165.96s)]
*  I wish I could say it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2167.08s)]
*  And I said, I want to say it sometimes. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2168.56s)]
*  And I said, you know, be careful. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2172.12s)]
*  You have to be judicious about it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2174.0s)]
*  He said, I'm worried about losing work. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2176.56s)]
*  And here's the thing, because I forget which one. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2178.8s)]
*  There was a survey that was done by my great friend, Andrew Doyle talks about it in his [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2182.4s)]
*  book, was survey done by the, I forget the group, but they said two thirds of Americans [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2188.1600000000003s)]
*  are afraid to speak their mind, two thirds because they might cause offense and another [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2194.32s)]
*  third are worried that it might affect their job opportunities. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2199.44s)]
*  So this is a real thing. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2203.28s)]
*  We can't continue as a society if everybody's so afraid. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2204.76s)]
*  That was what Alexander de Tocqueville admired most about America when he came here was the [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2207.56s)]
*  Frenchman seeing like people speak their mind here. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2212.2s)]
*  That is a unique thing. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2215.04s)]
*  That is the idea of freedom of speech is there's not an accident that that was put first before [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2216.48s)]

*  from your government. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2232.84s)]
*  That isn't to say there are not consequences for it, but the consequences of not speaking [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2233.84s)]
*  are going to be much, much higher. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2237.4s)]
*  So this young person was telling me, you know, I want to speak my mind and I want to, I want [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2239.12s)]
*  to talk about it, but I'm afraid about losing work. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2243.64s)]
*  And I said, you, I said, just be judicious. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2246.08s)]
*  Talk about it in your life, but it will affect your work. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2249.2400000000002s)]
*  If you do some people need to stand up, but I said it affect yours. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2251.2000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2255.28s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2256.28s)]
*  So your friend was right. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2257.28s)]
*  My friend was right. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2258.88s)]
*  He was right. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2260.36s)]
*  But I, I want to say that you, with that, to that young actor, I said, look, you can [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2261.64s)]
*  talk to the makeup person. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2266.48s)]
*  You could talk to the driver. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2267.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2268.6s)]
*  They'll always agree with you. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2269.6s)]
*  I've noticed through long experience, people who work for a living, they know this is all [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2270.6s)]
*  bullshit. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2274.2400000000002s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2280.4s)]
*  But don't talk to the producer. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2281.4s)]
*  Don't talk to the director. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2282.4s)]
*  Don't talk to the studio executive because they're all captured. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2283.4s)]
*  They're stuck in an ideological, you know, woke mind virus and they're not going to get [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2285.68s)]
*  out of it because it could affect their work because they don't operate like an actor operates. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2291.36s)]
*  I just want to get hired. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2294.56s)]
*  I just want to get work and every actor just wants to get hired. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2295.68s)]
*  But they operate from a different perspective. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2298.08s)]
*  The executives at studios in Hollywood, they offer, they know they're going to get fired. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2301.04s)]
*  They know it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2307.4s)]
*  It's just a matter of time, but they operate not what's the best movie. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2308.4s)]
*  What can I do that is meaningful to me? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2311.64s)]
*  They don't operate that way. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2314.08s)]
*  When they make decisions to make projects, they operate like, what will delay my inevitable [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2315.08s)]
*  firing the longest? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2320.84s)]
*  How do I keep this beach house? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2322.84s)]

*  So that's the crux. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2330.8199999999997s)]
*  I hope people watching this know how true what you just said is. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2334.4199999999996s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2337.74s)]
*  And it's not just the entertainment. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2338.74s)]
*  I'm sure it's everywhere. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2339.74s)]
*  People are like, they're just worried. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2340.74s)]
*  I got to ride this out as long as I can. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2341.74s)]
*  But yeah, it did affect me, but it freed me. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2343.8199999999997s)]
*  And you know what that's like. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2346.14s)]
*  It liberates you. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2347.9799999999996s)]
*  When you no longer feel a slave to the system, when they don't own you, you are free. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2349.08s)]
*  I mean, you're going to have to figure out how to make a living elsewhere. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2354.38s)]
*  But like I said to myself, and that's why I like, I love Chris Rock. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2356.66s)]
*  Chris Rock was like, sometimes you have a friend who like, and we were doing grownups [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2361.2999999999997s)]
*  together. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2366.82s)]
*  We were together every day. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2367.82s)]
*  And I just watched him in his mind and he changed stand up comedy. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2368.82s)]
*  And he's the one to talk me into doing stand up again. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2372.22s)]
*  Because Adam Sandler, he loves me and he won't. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2373.9s)]
*  And I listened to what he says, but he wasn't doing stand up at that time. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2376.1s)]
*  But Chris Rock was and he was the best at it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2379.86s)]
*  He changed modern stand up to what it is now. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2382.02s)]
*  He was a real influence on the, you know, that we built on. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2384.62s)]
*  And he talked me into doing it again. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2388.3s)]
*  And that's like, wow, that changed me. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2392.26s)]
*  And I said, they can take away the movies. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2394.2400000000002s)]
*  They could take away doing a TV show, but they can't stop me. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2397.1s)]
*  I said this to myself. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2400.42s)]
*  They can't stop me from performing with a bunch of other malcontents in a darkened drinking [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2401.7400000000002s)]

*  And you know what, Tucker? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2409.3s)]
*  They did! [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2410.3s)]
*  They did take it away! [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2411.6600000000003s)]
*  They COVID! [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2412.6600000000003s)]
*  They took it away! [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2413.6600000000003s)]
*  I couldn't even perform! [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2414.6600000000003s)]
*  And then they said, you know, you can perform. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2415.6600000000003s)]
*  And I would go to every state that was still open. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2416.98s)]
*  I did 14 shows for whatever capacity that they would do during COVID in the one place [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2418.7400000000002s)]
*  that was open in Nashville at that time, because they said 50% capacity. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2424.2200000000003s)]
*  So I'll just keep doing shows as long as people come. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2428.0600000000004s)]
*  And I did 14. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2430.5800000000004s)]
*  I have the record for shows there for half sold out show. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2431.5800000000004s)]

*  And so people didn't want to come anymore. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2437.54s)]
*  I stayed for a week. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2439.02s)]

*  I didn't mean to sound like Trump. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2442.74s)]

*  I could have stayed for three years. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2444.74s)]
*  It was the greatest show. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2445.74s)]
*  It was an amazing show. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2446.74s)]
*  I had the shows where disasters happened. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2447.74s)]
*  But what was really interesting was people, especially for conservatives, they felt like, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2450.34s)]
*  well, here's a guy who agrees with me and I don't see it on TV. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2456.02s)]
*  I don't hear that. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2459.38s)]
*  I don't hear other comedians. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2460.38s)]
*  It's like, because it's a fearful thing. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2461.38s)]
*  You know what? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2463.46s)]
*  You're not going to get on TV. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2464.46s)]
*  You don't see me on late night TV. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2465.46s)]
*  You don't see me going on Colbert talking about any of this stuff. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2466.46s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2471.2999999999997s)]
*  But so people has created an audience for me. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2472.2999999999997s)]
*  I didn't have one show that wasn't sold out last year. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2475.7799999999997s)]
*  Roanoke. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2478.1s)]
*  I don't know what happened there. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2479.1s)]
*  But anyway. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2481.1s)]
*  It's a tough town. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2482.1s)]
*  It's a tough town. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2483.1s)]
*  I got to tell you, I don't know what was happening that weekend. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2484.1s)]
*  Maybe there's a festival or something. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2486.1s)]
*  But people want to hear another opposing point of view. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2487.66s)]
*  They want to hear something they can relate to. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2490.3799999999997s)]
*  Thank you! [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2491.62s)]
*  I did this thing about, you know, you talked about United Airlines hiring. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2492.62s)]

*  White? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2500.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't care what it is. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2501.7799999999997s)]

*  The best pilot. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2505.18s)]
*  Of us landing this thing. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2506.18s)]
*  This is a... [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2508.2999999999997s)]
*  We're in a tin can at 37,000 feet. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2509.2999999999997s)]
*  I want the guy... [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2511.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry if your ideological problems or what your ideological vision is. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2512.8199999999997s)]
*  But mine is landing safely. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2520.22s)]
*  And so I did a thing about that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2523.3399999999997s)]
*  And I cannot fly without a pilot coming. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2526.62s)]

*  You know? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2531.2599999999998s)]
*  So it's... [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2532.2599999999998s)]
*  But there's an audience for it and they want to hear it. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2533.2599999999998s)]
*  So it's a pleasure. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2537.5s)]
*  So you felt no bitterness? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2539.02s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2541.14s)]
*  I definitely felt like, man, that was rough. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2544.4199999999996s)]
*  Did you ever... [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2548.7799999999997s)]
*  Did you take your friend's advice seriously when he gave it to you? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2550.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2553.7799999999997s)]
*  No, I realized that like, if I'm going to continue to... [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2554.82s)]
*  If I'm going to continue to make a living in this business, I'm going to have to be [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2558.7000000000003s)]
*  very judicious about it and be careful and take care of my family. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2566.3s)]
*  Because also, because my wife didn't understand. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2570.5400000000004s)]
*  My wife didn't understand. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2572.34s)]
*  It's like, you know, my wife's from Mexico, which is tougher than the United States. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2573.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2576.82s)]
*  And the hardworking people, thank God for Mexicans. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2577.82s)]
*  You want people that want to work and they'll work hard and you want... [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2581.2599999999998s)]
*  And I want, you know, legal immigration. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2585.3399999999997s)]
*  These people are lovely, hardworking people. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2587.66s)]
*  And she didn't understand. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2590.14s)]
*  It's like, why would you want to risk things for this? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2592.54s)]
*  And the most beautiful thing, and I talked to Robert Kennedy about this, and my wife, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2597.1s)]
*  when she said to me... [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2600.98s)]
*  She came to me... [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2603.8999999999996s)]
*  I was literally in the bathtub. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2604.8999999999996s)]
*  When she came to me, she said, I didn't understand why you would do this, why you would risk [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2606.54s)]
*  your career and income and our family by speaking up about this issue. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2613.1s)]
*  Because I always thought, as long as you protect them inside the house, they're protected. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2621.34s)]
*  And then we got this and then let the world take care of itself. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2625.54s)]
*  But now I realized that you have to also protect the kids outside the home. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2631.3s)]
*  And she sees the encroachment of this woke mind virus and the fact that, you know, all [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2637.5800000000004s)]
*  of a sudden there's a real attack on women in our society that I didn't... [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2643.3s)]
*  Nobody saw that coming. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2647.98s)]
*  And for her to recognize that. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2649.98s)]
*  I mean, it was really a really beautiful, special thing that I experienced and Bobby [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2652.8599999999997s)]
*  Kennedy related to that. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2661.62s)]
*  Do you think that she was proud of you? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2662.9399999999996s)]
*  Your wife? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2665.8999999999996s)]
*  Not before that. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2667.66s)]
*  So she comes to you and says, which I think is pretty common. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2670.66s)]
*  She says, look, I get you got these opinions, but you also have a family to feed. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2674.4599999999996s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2677.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2678.8999999999996s)]
*  And you explain to her that there's something bigger at stake. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2679.9s)]
*  What is that? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2683.06s)]
*  How can you think about what a... [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2684.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's a beautiful expression and we all have to be careful about this too. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2685.5s)]
*  And it's a Mexican expression. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2689.54s)]
*  And I've been doing Duolingo for like, you have a Duolingo for two years. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2690.98s)]
*  And I still, I'm just nervous about learning. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2697.14s)]
*  I've always had that. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2700.02s)]
*  But that's my excuse. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2701.54s)]
*  There's a beautiful expression in Mexico, which is the light of the world. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2704.14s)]
*  Is the darkness of the house. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2709.78s)]
*  So be careful about how about just going out there and trying to heal the world and do [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2713.82s)]
*  all these things. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2717.42s)]
*  And then your house is dark. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2718.42s)]
*  You have to take care of the house first. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2720.6600000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2722.5s)]
*  I strongly agree with that. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2723.5s)]
*  And you have to make sure everything's okay in there and that you're protecting and taking [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2724.5s)]
*  care of your kids and that they know that they're loved. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2728.5400000000004s)]
*  They know who their father is and that they feel safe and that they feel loved and that [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2730.7400000000002s)]
*  they're being raised with a faith in God and that they know their country is a good country [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2738.14s)]
*  and that they know that their future is secure. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2744.38s)]
*  And that's something that's tougher and it's encroaching on every aspect of it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2748.82s)]
*  So while I've been blessed and that people find what I have to say, some of them interesting [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2753.5s)]
*  funny. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2762.7400000000002s)]
*  I've been able to continue to take care of my family. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2763.7400000000002s)]
*  And to give the kids, all my children, the best education I can get. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2769.78s)]
*  And I went to public school and I didn't think there was anything wrong with it because I [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2774.18s)]
*  didn't have anything to compare it to. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2776.7000000000003s)]
*  But I will say that like, and you could put your kids if you're lucky enough to have the [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2778.46s)]
*  opportunity to put your kids in the best schools you can. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2782.62s)]
*  But the majority of our country is being educated in public school. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2785.12s)]
*  We have to make sure that that education for the majority of these people is good and [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2788.7s)]
*  that they're learning something that's useful and they're being taught to be critical thinkers, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2794.3399999999997s)]
*  to be useful for themselves and for society. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2799.4199999999996s)]
*  That they can come up and make decisions and not just crank out what's happening now at [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2803.1s)]
*  the university level in academia, which is just, they're just not cranking out, they're [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2807.58s)]
*  not making or helping people think critically, these young people. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2812.7799999999997s)]
*  They're cranking out advocates for a particular partisan ideology. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2816.78s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2821.94s)]
*  And so this has been going on for a long time. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2822.94s)]
*  We're late to the party to try to fix this. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2825.98s)]
*  The ideology which James Lindsay talks about has been infiltrated into our society. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2828.86s)]
*  And they started, they knew, the Marxists knew that, oh, well, the revolution is not [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2834.9s)]
*  going to happen with the worker. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2840.5800000000004s)]
*  Like, ah, well, why? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2841.82s)]
*  Because capitalism works. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2843.9s)]

*  Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile want you to believe that you need something called unlimited data. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2865.02s)]
*  Unlimited data! [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2870.82s)]
*  But the fact is that most people don't need unlimited data and nobody should be forced [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2872.6200000000003s)]
*  to pay for it. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2876.5400000000004s)]
*  It's really expensive. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2877.5400000000004s)]

*  But, so they did it through education. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2947.14s)]
*  They did it through people who had grievances. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2948.62s)]
*  They did it through small angry groups. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2950.18s)]
*  And they, as you know, they got into the educational system and they infiltrated it. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2952.9s)]
*  And by the 1970s, let's get K through 12 and then let's move on through to the university [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2958.42s)]
*  and academia. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2963.5s)]
*  By the late 1970s, they have infiltrated it. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2964.5s)]
*  And so you have this ideology now and this, whether you want to call it Marxist or, you [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2966.82s)]
*  know, this woke terminology, which is just Trojan horse terms like social justice. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2973.46s)]
*  Who would be against social justice? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2977.9s)]
*  I'm for social justice. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2979.34s)]
*  But when you realize that's a Trojan horse term and you go in and it's not social justice, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2980.34s)]
*  it's racism. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2984.1800000000003s)]
*  It's just the same crap the progressives were doing 100 years ago, inversed. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2985.2599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2988.74s)]
*  So you have like these same progressives who were like 120 years ago with eugenics talking [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2989.74s)]
*  about how these people are inferior. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2995.46s)]
*  We shouldn't, you know, we've got to kill them. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2997.62s)]
*  Yeah, we've got to kill them. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=2999.2999999999997s)]
*  We've got to not let them breed. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3000.2999999999997s)]
*  And then you realize like, well, these are inferior people. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3001.3399999999997s)]
*  These people of color are inferior. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3005.4199999999996s)]
*  And these people, you know, this is, you know, this is eugenics, you know, science back 110 [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3006.98s)]
*  years ago. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3012.98s)]
*  And this, you know, but with the Nazi Germany, you saw what the apex of eugenics was, was [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3014.14s)]
*  mass murder. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3022.02s)]
*  The Nazis killed hundreds of thousands of children and sick adults in hospitals, hundreds [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3024.1s)]
*  of thousands, I think 300, over 300,000. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3029.46s)]
*  And by the way, that's the one crime, you know, we spent a lot of time talking about [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3032.1s)]
*  the crimes of the Nazis, which is fine, but that's the one crime no one mentions anymore. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3035.46s)]
*  As a matter of fact- [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3040.94s)]
*  Because they're for it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3041.94s)]
*  That's why. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3042.94s)]
*  What you're having now is the same racism, but it's inverse. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3044.42s)]
*  So you're taking these people and they're like, well, these people are automatically [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3047.34s)]
*  victims, just because of the color of their skin. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3051.66s)]
*  These are their victims now, and they're oppressed by these people. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3054.58s)]
*  So it's just, it's easy to see what it really is, as it's just another way to just attack [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3057.94s)]
*  and use the same Marxist Maoist thing where these the people are the goods, these are [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3063.9s)]
*  the bads. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3068.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3069.02s)]
*  We're going to have utopias, which is these people aren't, they're the ones stopping it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3070.02s)]
*  And all you have to do is give up your guns and your rights, and then we're going to have [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3072.5s)]
*  it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3074.98s)]
*  And then, well, why don't we have all those people? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3075.98s)]
*  Well, let's get those people. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3077.86s)]
*  And so it's, you know, James Lindsay really helped educate me and a lot of others in his [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3079.5800000000004s)]
*  new discourses about what this really is. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3086.0600000000004s)]
*  And it's important for people to get educated and the people to realize so that they can [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3088.82s)]
*  identify it in their life, in their daily life at work. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3092.5400000000004s)]
*  Don't apologize. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3096.82s)]
*  If people want, if you're saying something, don't apologize for it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3097.98s)]
*  No apologies. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3101.98s)]
*  I don't apologize for my jokes, no matter what. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3102.98s)]
*  These are jokes, people. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3105.86s)]
*  Get over it. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3107.02s)]
*  It's funny, like in a horror film, you have like a slasher and they go like, some slasher [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3108.02s)]
*  movie. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3113.54s)]
*  Nobody comes out after horror film. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3114.54s)]
*  I did not approve of those slashings and those murders. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3115.54s)]
*  This is horrible. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3118.42s)]
*  Nobody even complains about it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3119.42s)]
*  Stand up, a guy talking and they go like, I don't agree with that. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3120.9s)]
*  That's, you know, homophobic, transphobic and that's, you know, sex, you know. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3123.26s)]
*  So it's a, you're held to a different standard. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3128.5s)]
*  I don't understand why. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3130.94s)]
*  So I, not a very good interviewer sometimes. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3132.9s)]
*  You said a minute ago that you were a Christian as a young man. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3136.0200000000004s)]
*  Then you go into the entertainment, how old were you when you went into the entertainment [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3141.5800000000004s)]
*  business? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3143.6200000000003s)]
*  Gosh, I was just trying to avoid a normal job, you know, cause I didn't like them. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3144.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3150.78s)]
*  The most fun thing ever was telling jokes with your friends. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3152.18s)]
*  And then I saw when I was 11, my dad took me to see George Carlin. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3156.3s)]
*  You know, by the way, remember when we were kids, parents, they'd watch whatever you want. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3160.94s)]
*  They didn't say, they took you to the movies. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3163.98s)]
*  It was too expensive to get a babysitter. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3165.74s)]
*  So my parents took me to see Planet of the Apes when I was five, you know, 2001, a Space [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3167.14s)]
*  Odyssey. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3172.94s)]
*  They didn't ask you, was that okay? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3173.94s)]
*  Was that too much? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3174.94s)]
*  Now my wife's like, it's not PG-13. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3175.94s)]
*  They're not saying it's PG-13. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3176.94s)]
*  You're not going to watch any of your movies. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3177.94s)]
*  My wife still has never let me see any movie. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3179.86s)]
*  They've never let my kids see any movie I've ever made except Daddy Daughter Trip. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3182.1800000000003s)]
*  So that was, you know, how I... [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3187.46s)]
*  Wait, your wife doesn't watch your kids... [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3192.38s)]
*  She won't let my kids see your movies. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3194.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, she won't want to see Deuce Bigelow as a man-whore or like The Hot Chick. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3196.82s)]
*  It does see it when they're 13. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3200.98s)]
*  So you go to the entertainment business. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3202.9s)]
*  And so I got into it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3205.5s)]
*  I saw George Carlin. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3206.5s)]
*  It was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3207.5s)]
*  And then when I was 14 or 15, I saw Steve Martin perform in front of 2000 people. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3208.62s)]
*  And back then I was starting to put it together like... [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3213.82s)]
*  Because you know, TV and movies, they're not real. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3215.94s)]
*  It's like those are people aren't real, you know? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3217.74s)]
*  It's like that guy, it's not real. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3219.58s)]
*  He's a movie star. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3221.06s)]
*  They don't realize, you know, he doesn't go to the bathroom. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3222.06s)]
*  That guy... [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3225.1s)]
*  And so when I saw Steve Martin in person, who just also changed comedy, he's the first [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3226.34s)]
*  guy to do stadiums, this guy. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3231.54s)]
*  And it was so funny and I was laughing. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3234.02s)]
*  But I saw him as a human being in the same room as me. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3236.38s)]
*  And I said, well, he did it. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3239.38s)]
*  He figured it out. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3242.06s)]
*  He was able to figure out how to be a performer. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3243.06s)]
*  Maybe I could. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3245.26s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3246.26s)]
*  And then I told my dad, my dad Marvin, who was a lovely man, who loved comedy. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3247.26s)]
*  And he had comedy albums. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3252.9s)]
*  So I grew up with that. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3253.98s)]
*  And I said, Dad, you know, on Monday nights, they let anybody go up and perform at this [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3255.42s)]
*  one club. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3258.28s)]
*  And he'd go, what is this? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3259.28s)]
*  That's the Holy City Zoo in San Francisco. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3260.6200000000003s)]
*  They let anybody go up on Mondays. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3262.5s)]
*  I said, it's Monday. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3264.58s)]
*  He said, let's go. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3265.8199999999997s)]
*  So I went. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3268.38s)]
*  He took me that night. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3269.38s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3270.8199999999997s)]
*  And you performed? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3271.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3272.8199999999997s)]
*  It was really awkward. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3273.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like seeing those drunk people in dark bars that were still smoking heavily at the [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3274.8199999999997s)]
*  time. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3278.2999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to see a kid up on stage. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3279.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like reminding them of what they're ignoring at home. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3280.7799999999997s)]
*  But you did it in front of your dad? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3282.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3283.9s)]
*  That takes some brass. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3284.9s)]
*  He was great. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3285.9s)]
*  You're great. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3286.9s)]
*  You're funny. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3287.9s)]
*  You guys are great. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3288.9s)]
*  You're terrific. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3289.9s)]
*  You're funny. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3290.9s)]
*  Where was he from? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3291.9s)]
*  He was from San Francisco. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3292.9s)]
*  He was one of the first men Jews. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3293.94s)]
*  His grandfather was from Tarnopol. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3296.28s)]
*  His father was from Tarnopol who came over. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3298.28s)]
*  And it's one of those things when they came over, they thought they'd save money somehow [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3300.5s)]
*  if they lie about the age. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3305.1800000000003s)]
*  So they put the different age there. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3306.88s)]
*  Save money by lying about their age? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3309.42s)]
*  He's 15. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3311.02s)]
*  But he's eight. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3312.02s)]
*  He's not nine. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3313.02s)]
*  He's eight. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3314.02s)]
*  I don't know why they did. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3315.02s)]
*  So he found out when he's older. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3317.26s)]
*  I said, I'm really a year older? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3318.26s)]
*  What happened? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3319.26s)]
*  And then my grandmother, Molly Hoffman. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3321.02s)]
*  She came from Ukraine. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3324.82s)]
*  And they came over and they worked hard. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3325.82s)]
*  He had my grandfather had a barber shop right next to the Fox Theater on Market Street [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3328.82s)]
*  in San Francisco. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3335.78s)]
*  Seventh Street and Market. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3336.78s)]
*  And he had a little barber shop. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3338.82s)]
*  He cut hair. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3340.1400000000003s)]
*  And my dad would shine shoes during World War II. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3341.82s)]
*  And he would get a nickel, dime. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3344.94s)]
*  And it was a great place to grow up. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3349.02s)]
*  He told me they give him like literally like a quarter. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3351.78s)]
*  And he'd be able to take that. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3356.78s)]
*  And I think I'm wrong about it. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3358.78s)]
*  They gave him like it was like a dollar. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3362.6200000000003s)]
*  And he was able to spend the whole day and go to the World Fair on a dollar by himself. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3363.6200000000003s)]
*  And this is 1939 World Fair in San Francisco. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3369.26s)]
*  So he was eight. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3371.42s)]
*  Just walking around by himself like not a care of the world. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3372.54s)]
*  What did he do in later life? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3375.6200000000003s)]
*  He went into real estate and carved out a little loan business for people. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3378.66s)]
*  Remember for people complaining about the price of the interest rates for homes and [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3383.66s)]
*  banks now. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3388.2999999999997s)]
*  In 1980, in their early age, it was 18%. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3389.2999999999997s)]
*  Thanks to the Carter administration, they were able to jack it up. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3393.2599999999998s)]
*  And so he would figure out a way with some investors to help get people to loan them [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3401.42s)]
*  money for a loan on their home or to help be their first home. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3407.54s)]
*  So like private banking. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3410.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3411.94s)]
*  And he did that. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3412.94s)]
*  And he was also just a really good guy who realized after the Brown v. Board of Education [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3414.54s)]
*  in 1954 that this racism stuff is stupid. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3420.42s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3424.66s)]
*  And so he was one of the first realtors in San Francisco to rent to African Americans [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3426.8999999999996s)]
*  in places that weren't. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3431.2599999999998s)]
*  And so that wasn't easy for him. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3434.2599999999998s)]
*  So with that, my mother was a school teacher. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3437.62s)]
*  I think it did. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3440.62s)]
*  My mother was a war survivor in World War II. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3442.4199999999996s)]
*  So I think that was a good... [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3445.14s)]
*  Where was she in World War II? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3447.7s)]
*  In the Philippines. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3448.7s)]
*  Her father was an American soldier. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3449.7s)]
*  She never met until she accidentally met him in San Francisco. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3451.4599999999996s)]
*  Both her brothers were killed during the World War. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3454.78s)]
*  By the Japanese. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3458.2599999999998s)]
*  By the Japanese. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3459.2599999999998s)]
*  But she had no bitterness about it. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3460.94s)]
*  And she really was a strong person. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3462.9s)]
*  And I didn't really... [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3465.02s)]
*  I'm still coming to grips with what my upbringing was with her. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3466.02s)]
*  And I respect her tremendously. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3470.58s)]
*  And she just said she was never fearful. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3473.66s)]
*  The reason I survived, I was never afraid. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3476.3s)]
*  I knew I was going to survive. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3478.34s)]
*  So she literally... [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3480.2599999999998s)]
*  Her mother would make bedsheets, take bedsheets, and sew them. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3481.2599999999998s)]
*  Because the thing about America, this is a unique experiment in freedom, in the history [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3487.06s)]
*  of the world. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3493.9399999999996s)]
*  That's why it's so important that we need to keep freedom of speech and keep our freedom. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3494.9399999999996s)]
*  Because there's no one that's going to come and rescue us if anything happens. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3498.7799999999997s)]
*  And so she would make with her mother, they would make these pajamas out of these soft [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3502.1s)]
*  bedsheets that they'd had. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3507.54s)]
*  And they would trade them because the case system, which is a lot of the world... [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3508.74s)]
*  My mother used to say, even maids have maids in the Philippines. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3514.1s)]
*  There's a descending, cascading poverty level that just keeps going down and down. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3516.8199999999997s)]
*  So she would trade these with the people, the farmers, who suddenly had the most valuable [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3521.8599999999997s)]
*  thing, food. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3526.1s)]
*  So she would walk for hours a day to get up to where they were and get this camote, which [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3527.1s)]
*  was sweet potato. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3533.3399999999997s)]
*  And she would trade for that. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3534.3399999999997s)]
*  She'd have to be really, really nice to these people. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3536.78s)]
*  And they knew that things have changed. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3539.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's how she survived. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3543.9s)]
*  And she said, not everybody did. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3544.98s)]
*  Her brother's 17th bill was drafted by Roosevelt under an agreement that you could be in the [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3549.6200000000003s)]
*  US Army if you're Filipino. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3558.38s)]
*  You could be drafted to go in the US Army. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3561.1400000000003s)]
*  So he did it at 17. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3563.34s)]
*  He was in the Batan Death March. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3564.34s)]
*  He survived it and then died of dysentery at 17. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3566.22s)]
*  Damn. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3570.66s)]
*  And her brother also died at 15. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3571.66s)]
*  He refused to believe that his brother had died. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3574.8199999999997s)]
*  He said, he's got to be with the guerrillas. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3577.98s)]
*  I'm going to go get him. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3578.98s)]
*  And my mother said, don't, don't. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3579.98s)]
*  She stayed up all night with him trying to talk her brother John into not going. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3582.14s)]
*  And she wasn't successful in the morning. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3587.74s)]
*  He gave her 100 pesos. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3591.58s)]
*  Hang on to this. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3593.18s)]
*  I'm going to come back. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3594.18s)]
*  And he never did. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3595.82s)]
*  And then it wasn't until my mother's like 60th high school reunion, where there's only [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3596.82s)]
*  a few people that have survived, where she found out why the Japanese captured him and [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3603.42s)]
*  interrogated him and killed him. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3608.7400000000002s)]
*  It's because he was, and she didn't realize it, but one of her classmates did because [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3610.2200000000003s)]
*  he was wearing, her brother was wearing their brother's US Army boots. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3613.98s)]
*  So the Japanese thought, well, he must know something. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3619.02s)]
*  And they killed him. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3621.94s)]
*  They killed him. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3622.94s)]
*  Because at that time, the form of information was rumored in Uendo. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3624.06s)]
*  So the rumor got back that the Japanese have him. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3628.78s)]
*  And what the Japanese said was, come and get your son. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3631.06s)]
*  My grandmother, Victoria, but my grandmother Victoria knew from what other happens, other [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3636.78s)]
*  families, if you go, the Japanese will torture you in front of him to make him talk. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3640.82s)]
*  And then they'll just kill you both. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3645.2400000000002s)]
*  So she had to make her Filipino Sophie's choice. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3646.62s)]
*  And she had three daughters. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3649.78s)]
*  So she stayed and they killed him. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3652.1s)]
*  But my mother didn't have a bitterness towards the Japanese. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3654.22s)]
*  I never heard one hateful thing. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3658.1s)]
*  My mother always said it was war. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3659.62s)]
*  And one of her brother-in-law was half Japanese who helped, one of the reasons they survived. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3663.18s)]
*  So that's just another. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3669.22s)]
*  What was she like as a mother? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3672.22s)]
*  She was tough. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3674.22s)]
*  Yeah, I bet. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3675.22s)]
*  She was tough. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3676.22s)]
*  Not your average Bay Area mom. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3677.22s)]
*  Well, there was a lot of Filipinos. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3680.3799999999997s)]
*  That was the beautiful thing about it. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3682.5s)]
*  Because on my birth certificate, it says, father white, mother oriental. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3683.7s)]
*  Back then, that's what in 1963, that's what you were called. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3691.02s)]
*  If you're Asian, you're not Asian, you're oriental. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3693.7s)]
*  I think Asian was like a slur. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3696.22s)]
*  I'm not Asian, I'm oriental. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3697.8599999999997s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3699.4199999999996s)]
*  It just means Eastern. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3701.1s)]
*  So my dad, yeah, my dad was open to this and it was beautiful. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3702.3999999999996s)]
*  He was very open-minded, a traditional liberal, which is the best. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3706.7s)]
*  Free speech, don't judge people by the color of their skin, women's rights, gay rights, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3712.66s)]
*  that traditional liberalism which has been abused to mean other stuff now. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3716.98s)]
*  So she was tough. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3721.8199999999997s)]
*  If you wasted food, that was a problem. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3722.96s)]
*  My dad had to tell her, we've got to throw this food out. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3726.2599999999998s)]
*  He said, what are you talking about? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3729.7799999999997s)]
*  It's still good. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3731.7s)]
*  He said, but there's mold on it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3732.7s)]
*  Yeah, but we can cut the mold off. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3734.62s)]
*  He said, no, what we do is we'll just buy, we'll throw it away and just buy new stuff [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3736.58s)]
*  of that. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3741.1000000000004s)]
*  And that was just like, I mean, that was my mother, that was a bizarre concept. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3742.1000000000004s)]
*  Throwing food away that you could still eat. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3748.1000000000004s)]
*  She told me like, she said, they took the camote and they would mix it and mix it until [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3750.1000000000004s)]
*  it was basically water just to stretch it out. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3754.98s)]
*  So she had something. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3756.78s)]
*  She starved during the war and she had stomach problems her whole life. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3757.78s)]
*  She lived to almost 93. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3760.94s)]
*  And she said, and then they would take the skin of the camote and we'd burn that. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3761.94s)]
*  My mother would burn it and that would be our coffee because it looked like coffee. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3765.36s)]
*  I was like, wow. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3770.8s)]
*  But she didn't say with bitterness, it looked like coffee. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3771.8s)]
*  Let's have some coffee. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3774.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3776.1200000000003s)]
*  So it's like, you know, so growing up with that, I didn't truly understand it. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3777.1200000000003s)]
*  And because what happens, I think, and now that I understand with like what I learned [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3780.8s)]
*  from great people like M. Scott Peck and Dr. Gabor Mate, was that there's traditional, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3786.88s)]
*  generational trauma. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3795.28s)]
*  Because I work with, you know, Gabor Mate worked with me on a couple of sessions and [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3796.28s)]
*  talked to me about generational trauma. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3803.04s)]
*  I said, what is that? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3806.0800000000004s)]
*  I didn't go through the war. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3807.48s)]
*  I know it's not my problem. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3808.48s)]
*  He said, yes, but it's passed on to you. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3809.48s)]
*  Because he was, you know, in his mother's womb during, in Hungary during World War II. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3811.84s)]
*  And he said, your mother, you know, she suffered. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3818.28s)]
*  She must have passed on to you. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3820.0800000000004s)]
*  And I said, no, I don't, what do you, I said, I don't think so. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3821.64s)]
*  I said, well, when you travel places, what is there anything, what is that like? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3826.48s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3830.48s)]
*  And he talked to me, what I do? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3831.48s)]
*  And I said, what is it? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3832.48s)]
*  Do you bring anything with you? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3833.48s)]
*  And I went, food. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3834.48s)]
*  You bring food with you? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3836.9s)]
*  Everywhere I go. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3838.56s)]
*  I got a bag. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3839.56s)]
*  I got some food in there. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3840.56s)]
*  He said, where do you think you got that from? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3841.56s)]
*  I was like, it's true. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3842.56s)]
*  If it gets moldy, do you throw it away? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3844.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3846.72s)]
*  And I go bang, I go right back to sprouts and I buy another. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3847.72s)]
*  We hear a lot from viewers about big tech censorship and those reports are more frequent [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3850.88s)]
*  than ever right now. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3855.92s)]
*  Censorship meaning shutting down your access to information, not lies or misinformation, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3857.44s)]
*  but true things. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3863.0600000000004s)]

*  The net effect of this, of course, is interfering in the 2024 presidential elections. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3870.2000000000003s)]

*  You're probably not shocked by this, but the specific examples of it do throw you back [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3878.64s)]
*  a little bit. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3883.24s)]
*  We've seen screenshots and videos showing how a Google search learned more about the [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3884.24s)]
*  attempted assassination on Donald Trump. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3888.08s)]

*  They don't want you to know that because it might help Trump. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3902.3199999999997s)]
*  We've seen examples where Facebook marked true photos of a bloodied and defiant Trump [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3905.08s)]
*  as misleading. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3909.4s)]

*  It's not democracy. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3925.92s)]
*  We've seen examples where a generic search for information about Donald Trump was automatically [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3926.92s)]
*  rephrased to show positive stories about Kamala Harris instead. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3931.6s)]
*  Is there any clear example of election interference? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3936.4s)]
*  So what do you do about it? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3941.56s)]
*  Well, Parler has been down this road. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3943.16s)]
*  Parler's pulled right off the Internet for telling the truth, but it's back and it's [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3945.7999999999997s)]
*  reaffirmed its lifelong unwavering commitment to free speech on Parler. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3949.68s)]
*  The Bill of Rights lives. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3955.72s)]
*  The First Amendment is real. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3957.14s)]
*  Because you're a human being and an American citizen and not a slave on Parler, users can [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3959.36s)]
*  freely express themselves, tell the truth, express their conscience and connect with [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3964.6800000000003s)]
*  others who are doing the same and they will not be interfered with. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3969.0s)]
*  They will not be censored. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3971.6400000000003s)]
*  Designs support a wide range of viewpoints. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3974.1200000000003s)]
*  Everyone is welcome on Parler. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3976.96s)]
*  Parler is committed to ensuring that everybody is heard. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3979.0s)]
*  And so it's become a place where independent journalism journalism is protected and respected. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3982.04s)]
*  It's protected because it's respected. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=3986.84s)]

*  I think my siblings got it worse than me. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4011.44s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4014.04s)]
*  Because I was the youngest. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4015.04s)]
*  You bring food with them too. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4016.24s)]
*  You know what? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4018.6s)]
*  I don't ask him about that. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4019.6s)]
*  I should. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4022.36s)]
*  But my I just remember being a really young boy. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4023.36s)]
*  My mother, my dad, he took her places, you know, and it was nice. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4028.12s)]
*  They would travel together and they would go out to dinner. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4031.8s)]
*  And I remember my mom yelling, all right, we're going out. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4033.88s)]
*  Anybody touch a hair on Robbie, I murder all of you. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4037.56s)]
*  Tough for the other kids, but I'm Robbie. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4040.32s)]
*  I think it helped create a monster. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4043.16s)]
*  Was she a Christian? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4045.68s)]
*  She was Catholic, but then she got divorced and she met my father, who was Jewish. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4047.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4055.04s)]
*  They both didn't. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4056.04s)]
*  I think they both made a decision about, I mean, she survived the Japanese. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4057.7999999999997s)]
*  She could survive not being accepted by the Catholic Church. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4063.0s)]
*  And I tried to get my priest, Father Paso, he was a great guy, to speak with her towards [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4067.64s)]
*  the end of her life. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4071.7599999999998s)]
*  And she just declined. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4072.84s)]
*  And I wanted her to really make peace. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4077.36s)]
*  And I think in a lot of ways she did. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4080.7200000000003s)]
*  And I, as time goes by, I realized, look what my sister told me, Sister April, who's a lovely, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4083.48s)]
*  lovely girl who had it worse than me. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4092.1600000000003s)]
*  She was older and her parents divorced. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4094.2400000000002s)]
*  My mother's first husband. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4099.46s)]
*  And she said, you realize we were raised by a 12 year old girl, right? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4102.16s)]
*  Because that's when that trauma happened. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4106.8s)]
*  And that's what like Dr. Gabor talked about with me. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4109.16s)]
*  So at that time of trauma is where they revert back to. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4113.12s)]
*  And it just all made sense. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4117.84s)]
*  I said, I get it. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4119.6s)]
*  So how did you, if your parents weren't believers, how did you become a Christian? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4121.12s)]
*  I found it. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4125.32s)]
*  I've just, it was a, I found some really happy, content people. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4126.32s)]
*  And I go, what's going on with these people? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4131.36s)]
*  They were not in the entertainment business. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4134.599999999999s)]
*  I'm betting. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4135.92s)]
*  They were not. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4136.92s)]
*  And I was in junior high and I go, what's with these people? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4137.92s)]
*  And my friend's brother, Ed Marcus' brother, he just, he was a very conflicted kid and [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4140.36s)]
*  had some problems and was experimenting with different things. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4146.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he just was suddenly the most peaceful guy to be around. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4151.5599999999995s)]
*  I go, what's happening with this guy? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4153.839999999999s)]
*  He said, I said, what's happening with you? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4155.96s)]
*  He said, well, come find out. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4157.759999999999s)]
*  And I went to this place and everybody in there was like, hey, so nice to have you. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4160.28s)]
*  Welcome. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4165.719999999999s)]
*  This is our house. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4166.719999999999s)]
*  This is your house. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4167.719999999999s)]
*  I was like, wow. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4168.719999999999s)]
*  And that's a beautiful thing that Mexicans say when you go to their house. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4169.719999999999s)]
*  They go like, it's to casa tambien. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4172.4s)]
*  This is your house as well. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4174.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4175.44s)]
*  What a beautiful thing to say to people. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4176.44s)]
*  And I went in and I was just really moved by how welcoming this was. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4178.28s)]
*  And this was, didn't feel like what I was in, you know, my house, you know, how people [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4183.28s)]
*  anytime somebody called my mom and answered, what is Robbie there? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4188.2s)]
*  Why? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4192.0s)]
*  Well, I go to school with him. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4193.0s)]
*  So, well, I just want to talk to him. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4194.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4196.2s)]
*  Because he's my friend and I want to check. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4197.2s)]
*  And so I grew up with that. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4198.2s)]
*  My mom, she, the world was a dangerous place for her. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4200.6s)]
*  Where are you going? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4203.28s)]
*  Don't go outside. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4204.28s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4205.28s)]
*  Because for her, she grew up. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4206.28s)]
*  That was a dangerous place. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4207.28s)]
*  So, you know, you have to have a balance with that. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4208.28s)]
*  You wind up in a classmates church and it seems like a place of refuge. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4212.04s)]
*  A place of peace. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4218.28s)]
*  I was like, what is this? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4219.28s)]
*  And then you, and then, you know, when you spend time reading the Bible, when you spend [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4224.6s)]
*  time with other Christians, you feel the presence of Christ. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4228.96s)]
*  You just do. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4234.88s)]
*  When I, you know, when I was doing the rosary with, and I have no problem with it with any [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4235.96s)]
*  other religions. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4242.12s)]
*  If you believe in Christ, you're my brother. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4243.12s)]
*  And if you're not, you're my brother too. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4244.68s)]
*  You know, those who are not against us are with us. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4246.2s)]
*  And those who are against us are potentially with us too. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4250.56s)]
*  We just have to be there. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4252.64s)]
*  You feel the presence of God. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4255.68s)]
*  And that is a powerful thing. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4256.84s)]
*  It's moving and it's healing. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4258.28s)]
*  And so while I strayed, you know, there's always in the back of my mind, I go like, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4260.76s)]
*  I'm never going to go away. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4264.88s)]
*  There's that, you know, Jesus, I'm never going to go away. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4266.4400000000005s)]
*  And when you need me most, I'll be there. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4271.320000000001s)]
*  And so it's times like this, though, it's just like, wow, it's beautiful. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4279.0s)]
*  And I hope I can, you know, I'm just very grateful and lucky and fortunate. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4282.72s)]
*  And, you know, I feel so close to him with my family, so gifted by everything. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4289.240000000001s)]
*  And all the problems that you have are just, you got to interpret it like this is a potential [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4294.52s)]
*  to bring you closer to God and to help people and to bring you closer to where you need to be. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4299.52s)]
*  This is all opportunities. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4306.200000000001s)]
*  And so I think as people are going to get really angry when the election happens, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4308.320000000001s)]
*  whoever wins, and I would just tell people, like, it's not Robert Kennedy talks about this too. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4312.8s)]
*  It's not the end of our republic. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4318.320000000001s)]
*  It's not the end of democracy. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4320.56s)]
*  It's going to be more encroachments. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4322.76s)]
*  If the Democrats win, I believe there will be more encroachments on freedom. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4326.400000000001s)]
*  But it's not the end. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4329.280000000001s)]
*  We still have the, you know, this tried and true legislative executive judicial. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4329.96s)]
*  And even though the legislative still continues to abdicate their power to the executive, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4336.2s)]
*  which, you know, it's not supposed to happen where the, you know, Biden comes in, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4341.16s)]
*  he does 125 executive orders. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4345.280000000001s)]
*  He's ruling. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4347.76s)]
*  We're basically hiring an emperor. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4348.68s)]
*  But still, get involved at the state level. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4350.360000000001s)]
*  Get involved with your school board. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4352.4s)]
*  And I would say one of the biggest dangers of an incoming continuation of the Democratic Party. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4354.04s)]
*  And I'm not saying that the Republicans haven't done their abuse and, like, you know, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4360.48s)]
*  the lies that the Bush administration, the wars they caused. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4363.599999999999s)]
*  But the problem is if the Democrats get back in, I'm worried about the educational system. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4367.24s)]
*  And as moms for liberty that talk about this, is giving more money from the feds to our school boards [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4372.599999999999s)]
*  at the state to control what happens at the state level and our local school boards. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4381.36s)]
*  So the school board meetings will mean nothing. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4386.719999999999s)]
*  It doesn't still be the feds will. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4388.24s)]
*  They're funding most of it. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4390.799999999999s)]
*  Twenty six percent they want to go to. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4391.799999999999s)]
*  I think it's 13 now. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4393.24s)]
*  If they do that and then control, then then we're really talking about another, you know, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4394.28s)]
*  problem with indoctrination of children. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4399.759999999999s)]
*  And that's going to be a real I mean, that's one thing we should really, really be aware about. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4401.679999999999s)]
*  Be act locally. Get involved. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4405.48s)]
*  What do you what will you say to people whose candidate loses in November? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4408.5199999999995s)]
*  Calm. No violence. No violence. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4413.12s)]
*  And and and know that it's going to be two years. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4415.44s)]
*  Hold your hold the reins. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4418.44s)]
*  If you know better who wins, hold the reins. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4420.919999999999s)]
*  It's going to be two years of what damage they can do. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4423.0s)]
*  And then they're going to be a lame duck for the next two years. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4425.5199999999995s)]
*  And just hold the reins. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4427.639999999999s)]
*  And I'm saying don't give in to violence. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4429.5599999999995s)]
*  Don't be. And unfortunately, our social media is creating and exploiting and making money off [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4431.599999999999s)]
*  turning people as extreme as they can so they can increase their addictions. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4439.28s)]
*  And these addictions that we started with, these are addictions of social media. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4443.16s)]
*  And that's something we got to control. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4446.719999999999s)]
*  Get a handle on. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4449.32s)]
*  And I would just tell people like anything new that's coming into the world, like whether it's airplanes. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4450.5599999999995s)]
*  OK, well, it's first invented in two thousand and nineteen oh three by the Wright brothers, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4455.4s)]
*  supposedly the Russians and French say otherwise. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4459.0s)]
*  However, 15 years later, this new invention, 15 years later, they were using it to drop bombs at and kill people. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4462.08s)]
*  And then it took another 20 years for it to become aviation, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4468.719999999999s)]
*  where people can actually get to places by the early 1930s. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4472.12s)]
*  So right now, social media is just at the time where it's just dropping bombs, killing people, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4475.12s)]
*  destroying people and canceling people and that stuff. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4480.2s)]
*  So we'll have to give it time. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4483.5599999999995s)]
*  And just for schools, can you imagine if you and I took our television set to school in the morning [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4485.28s)]
*  and our newspaper and our daddy's dirty porn magazines? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4492.2s)]
*  Imagine that I found underneath the stairs, by the way. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4497.4s)]
*  I noticed that we didn't have the same money for makeup as Playboy. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4501.879999999999s)]
*  But anyway, my point is, can you imagine bringing all that? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4506.32s)]
*  That's what you allow when you when you have phones in schools now. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4509.5199999999995s)]
*  So this is a real problem we have to get a handle on. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4512.16s)]
*  And like, you know, when you get bullied or whatever, or people would say bad things about you, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4515.639999999999s)]
*  you farted in the middle of class and it was humiliating. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4519.28s)]
*  Well, at least when you went home, it was like, well, it stops, it turns off. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4521.719999999999s)]
*  Now it never stops. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4527.2s)]
*  They got the phone and they got people saying stuff about you and this and how many likes you have. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4528.719999999999s)]
*  So like no phones. I mean, just flip phone, no social media to 16 minimum. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4532.4s)]
*  So, you know, calm down to see no violence. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4539.08s)]
*  Don't give in to it and just know that you can act. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4542.5599999999995s)]
*  And this is a country, it's a republic where it's not this parliamentary system in Europe, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4546.16s)]
*  which is where these unelected people, the European Commission now are controlling [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4550.88s)]
*  what happens in other countries. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4555.04s)]
*  And, you know, thankfully, Hungary is still holding firm. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4556.12s)]
*  And it really is under threat right now. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4560.8s)]
*  We have free speech. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4562.52s)]
*  There's the free speech in England is under attack. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4565.8s)]
*  Yeah, I would say comedians are under attack now. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4567.88s)]
*  So that's a, you know, Jay, we talk about in the book. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4571.2s)]
*  You can do it. The comedian's under attack. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4576.2s)]
*  And now they have this hate laws and free speech has to be. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4579.4s)]
*  Open to to protect the it's not the it's not the safe stuff or stuff [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4585.88s)]
*  everybody agrees with that needs to be protected. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4591.08s)]
*  You know, appropriate or approved speech is not the stuff that is protecting. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4593.76s)]
*  It's the unapproved stuff. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4598.12s)]
*  And you have to have all of it to have friction in society, to have the best ideas arise. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4598.96s)]
*  You know, and let let them be like ACLU when it used to be a decent organization [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4603.44s)]
*  that used to protect rights, you know, they've defended [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4607.92s)]
*  the Nazis, right in Skokie, Illinois to March, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4611.76s)]
*  not because they agreed with the Nazis, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4614.12s)]
*  but because the Jewish guy who was in charge of ACLU at the time said [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4617.0s)]
*  the best way to defeat the Nazis is to let them speak. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4620.16s)]
*  Of course. So they went to the then went to the Supreme Court [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4622.84s)]
*  and then to fight for them to for their right to speak. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4625.2s)]
*  Well, that's how a self-confident country behaves in a country that believes [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4628.2s)]
*  in its own values in its founding documents. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4632.32s)]
*  They're they're happy to tolerate disagreement because they they know that they're right [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4635.64s)]
*  and that if people are given the the freedom to choose, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4639.96s)]
*  they'll choose them. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4644.12s)]
*  You know, and I I feel like censorship suggests the people in charge [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4646.28s)]
*  know how hated they are and how stupid their ideas are. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4650.76s)]
*  And that's why they can't handle the challenge to them. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4653.84s)]
*  Well, if you if you abdicate your free speech, your your right [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4655.88s)]
*  to unfettered speech and you let some other the state decide, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4661.12s)]
*  well, then they're going to decide what's in their best interests. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4664.68s)]
*  Of course. And they're going to limit the speech and and they are trying to. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4666.48s)]
*  And it was really a shouldn't be surprising, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4670.44s)]
*  but it was it was like. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4673.88s)]
*  It was surprising to me that when it was discovered through the thank God [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4675.96s)]
*  for Elon Musk and and God bless him and protect him and pray for Elon Musk, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4681.36s)]
*  his protection, thank God for the Twitter files, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4687.0s)]
*  because the terrific work of [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4689.4800000000005s)]
*  as Matthew Schellenberger and Matt Taibbi, they this was really happening. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4692.68s)]
*  They were able to discover that the government was infringing on the [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4698.12s)]
*  rights of Americans and limiting and censoring speech [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4702.200000000001s)]
*  that they disagreed with for what the government wanted to do. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4705.88s)]
*  So for and then when they had congressional hearings, instead of correcting [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4708.84s)]
*  the situation, which was egregious and a violation of the [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4713.96s)]
*  First Amendment rights of Americans, instead of adjusting it based on this new evidence. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4718.76s)]
*  This anti-American attack on our system and free speech. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4725.08s)]
*  The Democrats were just like attacking the messengers [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4729.08s)]
*  and attacking the people who brought this and trying to undermine them and demonize them. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4732.96s)]
*  And it's like, wow, this is a time to regroup and go, hey, this is bad. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4737.6s)]
*  Let's fix this. Yes. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4742.64s)]
*  But they didn't do that. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4744.320000000001s)]
*  And that's what George Washington warns us about when partisanship, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4745.400000000001s)]
*  when people worry more about parties, then they can really be a threat to the nation. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4748.72s)]
*  That's for sure. So [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4753.400000000001s)]
*  you started on Saturday Night Live in 89, I think 89. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4755.28s)]
*  89, 90 season with the glory years. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4762.4s)]
*  Well, actually, I think that's that's fair. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4765.92s)]
*  I mean, the cast that you started with, you know, they're all still famous to this day. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4767.44s)]
*  We had we had a great cast. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4770.5599999999995s)]
*  But all I remember from that time is, you know, the newspapers saying how much we suck [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4771.6s)]
*  that we weren't as good as the first. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4775.5199999999995s)]
*  Who was on? Can you just remind us who was on the show that year? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4776.4s)]
*  Oh, well, you know, the great Dana Carvey, Dennis Miller, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4779.5199999999995s)]
*  Mike Myers, really talented guy, and Phil Harpman, of course. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4785.16s)]
*  And the new guys coming in, which, you know, was [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4790.44s)]
*  Nora Dunn was there and Jan Hooks, Kevin, the great Kevin Nealon, great guy and talent. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4796.5199999999995s)]
*  And then the new guys was me, David Spade, who got hired together as writers. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4803.0s)]
*  And then the next fall, 1990, Adam Sandler ended up coming. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4807.68s)]
*  And my buddy, who I lived right across the street with, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4812.28s)]
*  he lived with Judd Apatow right across the street from me in North Hollywood. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4816.599999999999s)]
*  And then Chris Farley came in at that time. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4819.16s)]
*  And it was a. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4822.72s)]
*  A really good time for a comedy, and it was a great place to be in their 20s. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4825.08s)]
*  And that's so that's 35 years, at least that you've lived in that world. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4829.84s)]
*  What's the response from your colleagues, peers, friends [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4835.0s)]
*  to some of the things that you've been saying over the last hour? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4840.400000000001s)]
*  They're coming around. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4846.240000000001s)]
*  You know, they don't agree with all of it, but I would say that. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4848.16s)]
*  They're agreeing more to what they're seeing, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4854.240000000001s)]
*  because it's it's tough, because it is insulated. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4857.240000000001s)]
*  You do you can you can stay in your political echo chamber. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4859.64s)]
*  You can absolutely avoid any [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4862.96s)]
*  questioning of your belief systems, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4865.799999999999s)]
*  because belief systems, what we're talking about, is the toughest thing to really [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4867.799999999999s)]
*  to to have challenged for sure. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4870.92s)]
*  Once you you can talk about like, am I a good cook? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4873.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I'm a good cook or whatever. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4876.839999999999s)]
*  You can talk about. But if you talk about your belief systems, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4878.16s)]
*  you talk about like you talk about somebody's sense of humor. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4880.12s)]
*  Do you have a good sense of humor? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4883.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Why wouldn't I? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4884.0s)]
*  But not everybody like you can't be a good cook. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4885.719999999999s)]
*  Not everybody has the best sense of humor. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4887.16s)]
*  You get to that belief system and start to question people get angry and [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4888.759999999999s)]
*  but I think people are waking up and you got to have people with differences of opinion. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4892.88s)]
*  The difference is, as you know now, it's like as we've seen before, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4897.240000000001s)]
*  if you disagreed, you disagreed and you work whatever, you know. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4901.88s)]
*  Now, if you have a different [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4904.68s)]
*  if you have a different opinion, you're a bad person. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4907.160000000001s)]
*  Yes. And you're judged for that. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4909.4800000000005s)]
*  So now people don't want to give their opinion, which is makes our [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4911.68s)]
*  which makes the expression and it makes our culture really bad. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4917.04s)]
*  Which makes the expression and it makes our culture poorer [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4920.56s)]
*  because we need everybody to talk and let the best ideas rise to the surface. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4923.72s)]
*  Exactly. And not judge them from a particular thing and [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4926.76s)]
*  for a particular point of view that they have every right to have. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4931.080000000001s)]
*  So but do you think that people in the world that you've spent your life in [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4935.0s)]
*  would agree with what you just said? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4939.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, I think so if you get them one on one, not on Twitter, not on [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4940.96s)]
*  Twitter, not on Facebook. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4945.64s)]
*  Has it? But have you been able to preserve your friendships [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4946.4s)]
*  despite political differences? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4949.44s)]
*  Most. Some people, sadly, yeah, from the Bay Area, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4952.879999999999s)]
*  who watch one of the networks that has four letters or [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4959.5199999999995s)]
*  was it M S N P C five? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4965.639999999999s)]
*  They used to work there and I didn't know that. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4970.2s)]
*  They love me. But I don't hear from them as much. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4973.64s)]
*  And they're lovely people and I love them. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4977.72s)]
*  And I feel like if they did see me, they'd hug me. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4979.88s)]
*  But they just, you know, they said to me, there's a lot of people like Gavin Newsom. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4982.400000000001s)]
*  Actually, that's what they're from Northern California. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4988.6s)]
*  There's a lot of people they really like him. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4992.320000000001s)]
*  And you know what? He's he's in power. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4994.160000000001s)]
*  And there was a chance that we were like, you know, worried because we saw what he [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=4999.84s)]
*  did to San Francisco. It's interesting because like you take guys that are really [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5003.0s)]
*  authoritarian. They have no problem closing your business. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5006.92s)]
*  Oh, no. But if it's a business that they're associated with or they get him, they'll [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5009.44s)]
*  keep open. And Justin Trudeau, the dictator of the North, he will [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5012.88s)]
*  have no problem trouncing on the rights of Canadians who are protesting, who [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5018.36s)]
*  really what helped open and end Covid was those truckers who risked everything there. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5023.2s)]
*  And this a-hole, cold, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5027.24s)]
*  weather dictator, closed their bank accounts and just completely took [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5031.4800000000005s)]
*  away their rights. And that's the thing about it, man. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5036.400000000001s)]
*  Your rights, they are on a piece of paper. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5039.4400000000005s)]
*  And unless they're backed by the will and by the goodwill and by the people [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5043.64s)]
*  insist on it, it's just going to be a piece of paper. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5048.400000000001s)]
*  And so that's what happened in Canada. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5050.68s)]
*  And those people's rights were trounced upon. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5052.4400000000005s)]
*  So luckily, though, but that that was enough to like wake people up, I think, in the [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5056.320000000001s)]
*  United States who had guns. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5059.84s)]
*  Yeah. And Robert Kennedy talked about this is that the reason why we got out of [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5061.76s)]
*  Covid, because when I said that I told him years ago, if you ever run for president, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5064.92s)]
*  I'm going to support you no matter what. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5069.08s)]
*  And I do. He's a great thinker and a wonderful man and really wants to help [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5070.8s)]
*  educate people and get people healthy. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5075.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't agree with everything he says, but who does? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5078.2s)]
*  The point is we agree on enough. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5080.4800000000005s)]
*  We can't just go Republicans, Democrats. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5082.04s)]
*  If you want to work with us on this issue, I'll work with you. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5084.16s)]
*  I don't care about what you know. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5086.400000000001s)]
*  Amen. I agree. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5087.8s)]
*  And so I'm willing to work with him and to, you know, to move this forward. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5088.88s)]
*  I said, but the guns. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5096.52s)]
*  Here's the thing. The only reason we got out of Covid was because there are at least [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5097.56s)]
*  400 million guns in America and the government can only push its citizenry so far. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5102.12s)]
*  And I said that is something that I as someone grew up in California, didn't [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5106.64s)]
*  understand that I understood pretty quickly during tyranny where the people could [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5109.72s)]
*  shut you down or like a governor could say, you can no longer open your business, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5113.76s)]
*  even though, you know, scientifically you can't. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5118.88s)]
*  There was no science behind it and it never had been. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5122.68s)]
*  And so they were allowed to do that. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5125.68s)]
*  And the fact that there has been no legislatures that have restricted the [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5128.0s)]
*  government's executive powers to prevent that from happening again is worrisome. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5133.72s)]
*  And I said, this, this, you know, they could turn it off at any minute. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5138.4400000000005s)]
*  So I do think that because of that situation, because of Covid, because people saw the [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5141.599999999999s)]
*  Covid tyranny and now it's been exposed that there was no reason for the six, you [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5145.799999999999s)]
*  know, the six feet of distance is all was just made up by Fauci and his cronies over [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5150.36s)]
*  there who were all paid by the pharmaceutical industry. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5155.04s)]
*  They have, you know, my friends have come around to go, you know, maybe Rob's not so [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5158.28s)]
*  crazy. I have friends who go like, you know what? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5162.24s)]
*  I didn't realize, you know, we just thought you were, we just thought you were nuts. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5164.44s)]
*  But now they've come around. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5167.36s)]
*  When did your views start changing and why? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5169.84s)]
*  I've always questioned things. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5173.08s)]
*  I mean, I hate to say this, but like I've always been kind of a contrarian. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5174.44s)]
*  But why do we have to do that? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5179.08s)]
*  That sucks. Let's do something else. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5180.8s)]
*  I grew up with my dad. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5183.08s)]
*  My dad, you know, set an example for just a troublemaker. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5184.88s)]
*  You know, so I kind of, you know, this way I didn't start out. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5189.64s)]
*  And comedians are intellectuals. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5192.6s)]
*  We're de facto intellectuals. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5193.84s)]
*  We got forced into it because everybody else got demonized and silenced academics where [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5195.36s)]
*  like they couldn't talk about stuff, scientists and doctors and comedians can still get on [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5199.32s)]
*  stage and still talk about it. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5202.76s)]
*  So these other people got silenced. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5205.08s)]
*  So we kind of have to step into that vacuum. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5207.32s)]
*  It's true. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5209.28s)]
*  And I just do what I can. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5209.88s)]
*  And, you know, this college dropout. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5211.44s)]
*  So that's I mean, it's, you know, Dave Chappelle becomes a leading public intellectual. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5214.5599999999995s)]
*  People. Exactly. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5220.0s)]
*  I saw him in 2016 because I go, what is happening here? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5221.36s)]
*  What is this like? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5224.2s)]
*  And I went, I'm going to go see a show. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5224.96s)]
*  And there's two shows happening. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5226.12s)]
*  There was the show of his show, which is brilliant. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5227.76s)]
*  And then there was a show of the audience looking at him. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5231.84s)]
*  Well, that was another show because they were looking at him. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5234.12s)]
*  Please make sense of the world for me, please, because it's not making sense anymore. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5236.48s)]
*  And he would. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5240.88s)]
*  And it's like, and that changed me. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5242.04s)]
*  And I realized, well, that's what, you know, that's the way direction to go. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5243.64s)]
*  And that was 2016. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5246.72s)]
*  So my dad was a guy who would like, he was friends with this IRS guy. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5248.16s)]
*  He used to be high up in the IRS. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5254.16s)]
*  I can't say his name. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5255.64s)]
*  My publisher. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5257.0s)]
*  Good friend to have. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5257.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5258.4s)]
*  He said, he said, he said, because my dad was pissed off. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5259.32s)]
*  He had to pay these taxes, which were much higher in the late sixties than they are now. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5261.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5265.4s)]
*  Very high. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5265.84s)]
*  You know, just, it was crazy higher than now. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5266.4s)]
*  People think about, I got to pay tax. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5268.08s)]
*  They were higher. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5269.4s)]
*  They're like sixties in the 60 percentile. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5269.88s)]
*  So my, and he said, got to piss off. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5271.96s)]
*  He said, he said, so what happens? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5273.4s)]
*  I get audited every year because he had a private, you know, business, basically [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5274.96s)]
*  a private little bank. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5278.8s)]
*  And he said, what do you do when the IRS agent comes over? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5280.320000000001s)]
*  He said, well, you know, I give him his own room and I, you know, they give him a [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5284.52s)]
*  box and a cup of coffee, whatever they need. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5286.76s)]
*  He said, don't do that. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5288.56s)]
*  So what do you mean? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5289.84s)]
*  He said, just give him a box, put the stuff on the floor, you know, put the [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5290.8s)]
*  stuff on another box and, you know, and said, bring the kids over, let them play [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5297.0s)]
*  and run around the room. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5300.96s)]
*  And he said, he'll be gone in an hour. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5302.6s)]
*  Don't make it easy for him to harass you. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5304.96s)]
*  He said, just, yeah, just, just go to have the kids run around. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5307.84s)]
*  Don't make it comfortable, too comfortable, you know? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5309.8s)]
*  And so we would run around and I couldn't believe like my, cause my dad would never [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5312.400000000001s)]
*  let me run around when there's people in the office and I got this people. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5314.88s)]
*  We can sit down. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5317.360000000001s)]
*  He said, just play what you want. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5317.76s)]
*  My brother like, what? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5320.72s)]
*  Really? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5322.6s)]
*  So it was a disaster. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5323.360000000001s)]
*  We're running around dropping and breaking stuff and all this stuff. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5324.84s)]
*  And it was, my dad was like, I said, this is different. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5327.4800000000005s)]
*  I didn't understand what it was till now. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5329.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a years later, but that was my dad's kind of way. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5330.92s)]
*  Like, ah, you know, ah, giving it back to the man and some small fun way where [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5333.68s)]
*  he can get a laugh out of it. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5339.84s)]
*  My dad used to love to laugh and get laughs out of situations and whatever [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5341.360000000001s)]
*  way he could, and I guess some of that rubbed off. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5346.280000000001s)]
*  Did they stop auditing him? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5351.04s)]
*  Not as much. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5354.88s)]
*  And they were definitely quicker, but, uh, he was a genius with math. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5356.200000000001s)]
*  My dad was a math genius. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5360.04s)]
*  He'd before a calculator, he just figured out, just like, I couldn't [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5362.0s)]
*  believe what he would do. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5366.04s)]
*  And, um, did he live to see your career? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5367.08s)]
*  He lived to, thankfully he got to see like a movie might become a big hit. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5370.88s)]
*  And it was like, he called me and left a message on my machine. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5376.639999999999s)]
*  And he said, well, Robbie, I think you finally got a hit on your hands here. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5380.679999999999s)]
*  I went to the, um, theater in San Bruno. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5385.16s)]
*  Two theaters had your movie too. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5388.16s)]
*  And they're both sold out. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5390.04s)]
*  So I think you got a hit, you know, and my mom started getting the show business. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5391.0s)]
*  She said, you know, the Batman movie made 400 million, but they had, but [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5395.04s)]
*  their per screen average was higher because there was in 4,500 screens. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5398.16s)]
*  So the per screen average, when you look at it, it's not as much as your movie. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5401.92s)]
*  When you, so they got into it quick and they're very proud of me. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5404.52s)]
*  So that was, I was real then my dad got to see that and he got to go and be there. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5409.28s)]
*  And he died a month later, but, uh, that was just beautiful. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5412.92s)]
*  He got to see that and go to a premiere and my dad dressed up. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5416.84s)]
*  I got to sit next to him and my daughter, Elle on this side. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5419.36s)]
*  And it was just, um, that was beautiful. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5422.16s)]
*  And I, I, I missed those times and I missed the phone calls and, and, you [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5425.759999999999s)]
*  know, Calling and him checking in on me and going, Hey dad, let me call you back. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5429.599999999999s)]
*  He says, you always say that. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5433.96s)]
*  Why can't you talk now? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5436.24s)]
*  And I wish I could have that conversation back. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5437.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5439.2s)]
*  But those are beautiful times and to have that support of your father. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5441.08s)]
*  That's why it's so important to support and love your kids unconditionally [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5444.639999999999s)]
*  and give them the reflect God's love onto them. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5448.16s)]
*  And that's, that's our job as a parent and in society. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5451.88s)]
*  And I fail. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5454.599999999999s)]
*  I fail at, um, and being the best person I could be. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5455.639999999999s)]
*  And I get angry and sometimes I spout my mouth off. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5458.12s)]
*  And, but when some people, you know, attack people that I care about, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5461.88s)]
*  it really bothers me and I got to calm down, you know, so, but. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5465.16s)]
*  So they always tell you it's the most important election of your lifetime. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5472.44s)]
*  But of course, this one actually is that's demonstrable. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5475.28s)]
*  And it's also because it is so important being censored at every level by the [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5478.4s)]
*  tech companies. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5482.04s)]
*  So we were thinking about this a couple of months ago and we thought, why not [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5483.24s)]
*  get on the road live in front of actual people, live audiences, coast to coast [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5485.599999999999s)]
*  and nationwide tour where we can't be censored. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5490.88s)]
*  That'd be good. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5493.84s)]
*  It would also be fun. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5494.5599999999995s)]
*  So we're doing it. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5495.44s)]

*  It's an authoritarian country. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5550.719999999999s)]
*  But you were you were punished by the Canadians for telling naughty jokes. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5551.88s)]
*  I was. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5556.44s)]
*  They really went after me and it hurt. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5557.04s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5560.12s)]
*  I remember like I remember that my favorite thing was because it was accused of being, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5561.96s)]
*  you know, transphobic, like it's just to fill in the blank, whatever you are. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5566.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5569.6s)]
*  So you can tell jokes. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5569.88s)]
*  I mean, the fact of the matter is like if if we're just going to throw biological [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5570.8s)]
*  reality out, the truth, it could be, you know, not nice, but it's never hateful. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5577.08s)]
*  No. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5582.52s)]
*  The fact that, you know, and I said I did some jokes about that. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5583.08s)]
*  I do my stand up back there if I had a son and if he sucked at sports like I did and [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5587.84s)]
*  I wanted him to be a champion and victory, I said, well, just go, you know, I said, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5591.32s)]
*  listen, it's not nice, but just go tell him. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5594.88s)]
*  I want you to feel you know, you're losing all the guys. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5597.52s)]
*  I want you to go and tell the coach that you're you're a girl, you know, and then, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5600.0s)]
*  you know, no, no, no, that's the best part. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5605.84s)]
*  You get to keep your dick. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5607.08s)]
*  You can keep the whole thing. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5607.8s)]
*  The whole thing doesn't matter. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5608.72s)]
*  No, just tell them and they have to accept you. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5609.68s)]
*  You just say it. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5611.2s)]
*  You just say it. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5611.64s)]
*  And then I said, and you went out, you then you know, I do this thing. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5612.12s)]
*  And anyway, it gets big laughs, but it's also like, that's what things they complained [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5614.72s)]
*  about and people were laughing at that outrageous, you know, humor. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5619.04s)]
*  And I said, the Canadians were mad that the audience laughed. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5622.64s)]
*  So one guy who was the same guy and all the complaining. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5624.88s)]
*  And I remember like they were really laughing and then he kind of got quiet [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5628.0s)]
*  because they're, they're too polite. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5630.92s)]
*  Canadians are too polite. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5633.04s)]
*  They don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, which ends up hurting everybody's feelings [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5634.2s)]
*  because then you had, you end up having some, some guy who loves China running your [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5637.32s)]
*  country. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5641.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5641.84s)]
*  So it's important to speak up and speak your speak freely and say when this, when your [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5642.240000000001s)]
*  countrymen, I said, I have nothing to apologize to you, Canada, about if you know what [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5648.72s)]
*  you, I will consider an apology, consider it when you apologize for what you did to [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5653.08s)]
*  those truckers and what you that, that, that ugliness of not supporting those people who [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5658.52s)]
*  are risking everything to drive all the way across the country, shut the country down [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5664.280000000001s)]
*  so that, that this tyranny could end. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5668.88s)]
*  And it was a powerful movement and it was a movement not, and to not, to, to stand [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5670.92s)]
*  there and let your government officials call them terrorists. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5676.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5679.56s)]
*  That is, and put them in prison, which they did disgraceful. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5680.280000000001s)]
*  It is disgraceful. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5683.400000000001s)]
*  And so when you make that official apology, I'll talk about like how I felt them, why [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5685.240000000001s)]
*  I did certain jokes and I have no apologies to you at all. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5690.240000000001s)]
*  And I'm glad I did it. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5693.160000000001s)]
*  And I would do it again if you let me back in the country, which I assume they won't. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5694.64s)]
*  I will not be allowed back in the country. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5698.160000000001s)]
*  I've been just for, for hate speech for jokes. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5700.080000000001s)]
*  And you're not allowed on late night TV either. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5703.8s)]
*  I don't get invited to a place. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5706.04s)]
*  Do you care? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5709.320000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5710.0s)]
*  Why would I, I mean, like it's, it's not, I mean, as I said, you know, it got on [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5710.52s)]
*  Twitter and then Fox news, of course, which I said, you know, much late night TV is just [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5714.400000000001s)]
*  a political indoctrination with comedic imposition. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5720.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5723.68s)]
*  It's just, and it's, it was, it no longer resembles comedy as much as, you know, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5723.96s)]
*  cheering on the rhetoric and, you know, attacking a particular, it's one half of [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5729.2s)]
*  the country. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5735.64s)]
*  And, you know, when I saw the dancing syringes, I was like, oof. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5736.56s)]
*  But you know, all those, that's the weird thing is you know, all those guys, I [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5741.92s)]
*  assume, because you lived in that world. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5744.68s)]
*  I, I know most of them. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5746.6s)]
*  But it's, I mean, it's easy to, I mean, and God bless them. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5749.08s)]
*  And I hope that they can come around to become more independent in their thinking. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5753.759999999999s)]
*  Cause they're, they, you can literally replace the, the, the dialogue, I mean, the, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5756.799999999999s)]
*  the jokes from one late night guy to the next guy, and then put them in the mouth [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5762.5599999999995s)]
*  of this guy. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5765.719999999999s)]
*  And it's just, there's no individual point of view. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5766.48s)]
*  Cause it is, it is really ideologically captured and trapped. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5769.24s)]
*  And I, you know, I hope that they would realize that that's limiting. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5773.2s)]
*  I would hope that like you didn't, you realize, you know, soul destroying. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5776.8s)]
*  I think it's, I don't think it's good. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5780.64s)]
*  And I think people have woken up to it and go like that ain't, that's not, that's [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5782.96s)]
*  not representative of our country. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5787.64s)]
*  And I think it's a job to question authority, no matter who's in authority. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5789.280000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5793.16s)]
*  You question me Saturday Night Live at its best, truthfully, was trying to make our [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5793.68s)]
*  friends laugh and question authority, no matter, and make fun of authority, no [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5796.84s)]
*  matter who's in charge. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5799.88s)]
*  I remember we were making fun of Bill Clinton. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5801.200000000001s)]
*  We had Julia Sweeney played Hillary. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5802.92s)]
*  I misplayed played Monica Lewinsky. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5807.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5810.4s)]
*  She played the, the daughter, what's her name? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5810.76s)]
*  The Chelsea. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5813.24s)]
*  And I remember like, you can't go after somebody's kid. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5814.04s)]
*  How dare you? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5816.88s)]
*  And I'm like, well, it's a kid, you know, we're not, she just put braces on. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5817.72s)]
*  So there, there seemed to be like an outrage with liberals. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5821.88s)]
*  They don't have as good a sense of humor. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5825.32s)]
*  They just, well, I should say this, I'm sorry. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5826.8s)]
*  They have the more sensitive and they just, they get outraged and, um, and they [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5828.92s)]
*  could, uh, they don't like it. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5835.4400000000005s)]
*  So, but at the time, the Saturday Night Live did it anyway. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5837.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5840.400000000001s)]
*  And they're coming back to it. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5840.96s)]
*  I really think that they've, you know, they're making fun of Biden. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5842.04s)]
*  They have, and they got a good crew. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5845.08s)]
*  They're really talented new group and they're going to, it's, it's an institution. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5846.76s)]
*  And like any institution, whether it's a particular late night show or a [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5851.88s)]
*  network or Saturday Night Live, any institution is going to be susceptible [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5855.68s)]
*  to, um, this ideological claptrap and it is, but it's also, you can understand it. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5860.400000000001s)]
*  And I think as I'm, you know, I was angry about it and, you know, I have to come to [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5866.08s)]
*  it from a place of peace and understanding if I'm going to help it, if I'm going to [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5870.52s)]
*  participate in this culture, I have to come from a place of understanding and [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5874.360000000001s)]
*  it kind of, you know, it doesn't come naturally to me, but I got to come from a [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5877.84s)]
*  place of understanding, tolerance, forgiveness, and empathy, and it's hard to [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5881.12s)]
*  fight against that when you are getting this, you can only talk about this and [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5884.92s)]
*  everything's got to attack half of the country and, um, they are susceptible to [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5889.28s)]
*  that and hopefully they'll realize because the ratings are getting smaller. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5895.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5899.96s)]
*  The number one guy is a very funny, Greg, Greg Gutfeld, you know, my buddy, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5900.4400000000005s)]
*  Jamie Liso goes on the show all the time. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5905.72s)]
*  Um, that's the number one show. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5907.96s)]
*  So if you want to, if it's about ratings, about money, well, then think about the [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5910.92s)]
*  money and I think eventually Hollywood, if they're anything, they're whores and [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5913.8s)]
*  they will do what makes money. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5918.0s)]
*  They didn't, you think that Sony pictures wants to have a Christian division. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5919.400000000001s)]
*  They didn't care about that, but they do now. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5923.4800000000005s)]
*  Why? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5925.68s)]
*  Because people like angel studios are making money non-traditionally and they [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5925.96s)]
*  didn't see that coming when, when, uh, Mel Gibson made passion of the Christ. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5930.360000000001s)]
*  They tried to destroy that. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5935.12s)]
*  Oh, I remember very, very well. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5936.84s)]
*  They hated him for that. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5938.4400000000005s)]
*  And they did not take him out. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5939.4800000000005s)]
*  And that became the first real internet like sensation. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5940.84s)]
*  Uh, and they couldn't stop. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5944.08s)]
*  He's a tough man. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5946.08s)]
*  He can take it because he has a faith in God and he's like, and Catholicism is the [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5947.4800000000005s)]
*  closest to the original words of Jesus. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5951.68s)]
*  And that's why it works for me. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5953.56s)]
*  Um, and I, there's a film that I want to make called about the shroud of Turin. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5955.6s)]
*  And it's the shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5960.68s)]
*  It is. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5964.4800000000005s)]
*  And the fact that the Sturpp scientists tested it in the wrong place and didn't, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5965.28s)]
*  didn't, um, put quantify that, that there is these French nuns who were trying to [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5969.84s)]
*  repair in the 16th century, the Lord's, their Lord's burial cloth, that they would [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5975.8s)]
*  do this, this French thing called this French weave called an invisible weave. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5982.6s)]
*  And that altered the findings of the, of the testing of the carbon dating. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5986.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5990.72s)]
*  And so there's this beautiful movie that we want to make and I'm going to make that. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5991.04s)]
*  And it's, it's just expensive to make movies. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5994.84s)]
*  And obviously, you know, I'm don't find myself in the good graces of Hollywood [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=5997.0s)]
*  right now, but luckily, um, there are enough people who, who want to bring a [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6001.0s)]
*  message of, of healing. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6006.84s)]
*  Are you going to approach Disney with that movie? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6008.2s)]
*  No, I don't think Disney is going to come around anytime soon. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6012.04s)]
*  You know, it's so funny is that like, you know, when I got the Disney channel, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6015.4s)]
*  I know my ego is like, maybe they have the, the, the, I'm the Disney channel to [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6017.6s)]
*  have the hot chick and they would never make that movie now. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6021.24s)]
*  And I started turning it and they didn't have it on there, but it's on Amazon [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6023.8s)]
*  prime, baby. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6026.64s)]
*  So Disney also is another organization that caught up and what sounds good [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6028.160000000001s)]
*  social justice, you know, the, the equity, equity, yeah, whatever it is. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6033.0s)]
*  They have to, but what, what equity is, is a grievance with the, it's people [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6038.8s)]
*  like, I want this and these, the idea that somehow we're going to get the same [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6043.320000000001s)]
*  outcomes and that they're guaranteed. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6048.0s)]
*  It was like the, you know, Kamala Harris is a dog whistle. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6050.44s)]
*  Now is this, this is equity thing. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6055.839999999999s)]
*  And what, what if we don't have, as Thomas soul says, if we don't have the [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6057.879999999999s)]
*  same outcomes in the same family, how are we going to have that in society? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6061.28s)]
*  We have to have a meritocracy. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6066.4s)]
*  We have to have the best people and we have to have sanity. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6067.719999999999s)]
*  So, but Disney, no, they're not going to make a movie and I hope that they do well. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6071.32s)]
*  It's, it's a company that is, that I worked for many, many years ago. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6075.24s)]
*  I say it's a best brand in show business. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6079.32s)]
*  I will tell you a funny story that when I was there, I think, um, Bob Iger [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6081.84s)]
*  had just taken over from a great man. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6085.96s)]
*  I really loved Eisner. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6087.44s)]
*  He's the one who turned that company around. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6088.92s)]
*  Um, and, um, he's a fan of mine with my movies. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6090.88s)]
*  So I love the guy, of course. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6094.04s)]
*  Um, but when I came in and then I was still there and you know, you're out [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6095.759999999999s)]
*  when the new regime comes in the old one. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6099.44s)]
*  Been there. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6101.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6101.92s)]
*  It was for a few months, been a few months and, um, they were talking about the movies [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6102.24s)]
*  and unfortunately I was involved in, you know, at the regime, it wasn't making a [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6107.32s)]
*  lot of money for movies at that time. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6111.24s)]
*  We were on our way out. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6113.16s)]
*  We all knew it. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6114.36s)]
*  And then there was a, um, a meeting with the board of directors and I think [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6115.2s)]
*  Senator, um, the, uh, Mitchell was one of the, yeah, on the board. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6120.16s)]
*  And they said, um, and the Eisner was, I'm sorry, Iger saying, well, you know, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6126.32s)]
*  but this is what we, they looked into the boats. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6130.639999999999s)]
*  Well, the boats made 18 million last year profit. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6132.16s)]
*  And then the, the parks made this made 34 million profit. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6135.28s)]
*  The way, why the movies, they lost money. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6140.08s)]
*  Why, why, why do we need to make these movies? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6142.52s)]
*  Let's just not make movies and just do the boats. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6145.16s)]
*  He said, well, um, Mr. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6148.12s)]
*  secretary, um, I think the movies are what get people on the boats. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6151.0s)]
*  So, uh, so, uh, US senators aren't the best judges of no surprisingly. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6158.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6164.4800000000005s)]
*  Aren't the best judges of what movies should be made for children and their [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6164.92s)]
*  families. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6168.0s)]
*  I hope Disney comes around. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6168.52s)]
*  They see what happens when they get too woke. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6169.96s)]
*  They get spanked. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6171.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6173.2s)]
*  They get spanked and they, um, you know, that that's a company that I got a route [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6173.4s)]
*  for and I got to hope that they write the ship and, and, you know, money has a [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6177.92s)]
*  strange way American that's think about America. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6181.04s)]
*  People come from all over, you know, an America, whatever they believe system, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6182.96s)]
*  America is a wonderful seductiveness about working your butt off. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6186.6s)]
*  You get successful making money. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6190.6s)]
*  And, and so we've had a wonderful check and balance here. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6192.36s)]
*  Usually with what makes the most money. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6195.2s)]
*  Let's keep doing that. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6197.839999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6198.96s)]
*  So I would hope that Disney writes its ship and gets away from this trying to [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6199.719999999999s)]
*  indoctrinize our children. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6203.44s)]
*  How awful is that? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6205.44s)]
*  Depressing. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6207.44s)]
*  It was really bummer that the fact that I, you know, my wife and I would have to [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6208.639999999999s)]
*  watch the movies first before we let our kids, the last few years, we have to [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6211.759999999999s)]
*  watch the movie first before we let our kids see it and let's see what's, let's [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6214.719999999999s)]
*  just check it first. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6217.4s)]
*  My parents never did that to me. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6218.92s)]
*  They took me to see the Godfather, Sonny Carleone. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6220.12s)]
*  They didn't ask me, how did you deal with that? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6223.28s)]
*  You know, we just, we, they didn't want to get a babysitter. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6224.679999999999s)]
*  So, but, so we would watch these movies just to make sure, well, my wife would, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6227.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, she does most 90% of the child rearing, but, and to make sure that, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6232.96s)]
*  that they're not getting any stuff that we don't want them to have. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6237.759999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6240.599999999999s)]
*  And that that's not okay. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6241.599999999999s)]
*  That's not good for their business. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6243.0s)]
*  It's not good for society to like the, you're putting out stuff there that is [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6244.599999999999s)]
*  undermining a traditional family. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6250.44s)]
*  Well, and trying to destroy the lives of kids. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6252.16s)]
*  I mean, that's pretty dark. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6254.44s)]
*  It doesn't get any worse than that. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6256.28s)]
*  How would you rate Trump, not politically, not personally, but from a comedy standpoint? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6258.4s)]
*  Well, I've met him a few times. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6263.28s)]
*  Nice guy. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6264.48s)]
*  I liked him. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6265.48s)]
*  You think he's funny? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6266.2s)]
*  Very likable. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6266.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6267.16s)]
*  That's the thing about it. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6268.28s)]
*  It's like, you know, you have a guy who's genuinely has a sense of humor. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6269.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6272.639999999999s)]
*  He tries to make jokes and then the jokes are like, he said this, you know, will [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6272.84s)]
*  he be a dictator on day one? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6277.5599999999995s)]
*  But then that's, you know, it's okay. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6278.84s)]
*  It's a joke. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6280.639999999999s)]
*  He's joking. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6281.32s)]
*  He doesn't mean it. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6282.16s)]
*  It's like, no, he's going to be, you know, so he's got to be super careful. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6283.08s)]
*  That's why I feel sorry for anybody in the public eye. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6287.04s)]
*  And unfortunately, during COVID, he listened to the wrong people and he trusted the [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6290.12s)]
*  wrong people. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6295.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6296.12s)]
*  But I think he learned from that. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6296.48s)]
*  And I think this time, hopefully, you know, I don't think he's going to, I don't [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6297.96s)]
*  think he's going to make that mistake. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6304.64s)]
*  I hope not. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6305.84s)]
*  You know, I mean, I hope he doesn't just put in the bankers in charge of the banks [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6307.32s)]
*  and then the pharma people in charge of the CDC and the FDA. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6310.32s)]
*  And I'm hopeful, but I think anybody who doesn't need it, who would I mean, I [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6314.76s)]
*  wouldn't want to run for president. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6321.48s)]
*  No chance. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6323.16s)]
*  But he's subjecting himself to this. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6325.2s)]
*  I mean, wow, that's rough. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6328.0s)]
*  And I admire anybody who wants to serve their country in the capacity. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6331.76s)]
*  And if you think about traditionally with John Adams, to be a doctor, an attorney, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6337.04s)]
*  the highest thing he could be was to be a public servant and go into politics. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6345.08s)]
*  That's what he felt was the, his highest calling. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6349.84s)]
*  And I think we've moved away from that now. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6353.280000000001s)]
*  So I, you know, I want what's best for this country. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6357.6s)]
*  And I do think I like governments that are less administrations, I should say, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6360.96s)]
*  that are less confident so that they won't don't want to go around and start more wars, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6365.6s)]
*  blow up, blow up the world. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6369.52s)]
*  And I think we're at a time financially in this country. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6371.360000000001s)]
*  You just can't keep spending another trillions and trillions of dollars and expect this, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6374.200000000001s)]
*  this, this just has to be magically taken care of. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6377.4800000000005s)]
*  This, this is an issue that this is a real problem. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6380.68s)]
*  And this administration and the same thing with the Republicans in Congress, this [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6383.72s)]
*  Ukraine war has to end. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6387.400000000001s)]
*  We had to get out of it. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6388.88s)]
*  And whether it's Robert Kennedy, who's a great guy, or, or whether Trump gets in [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6389.76s)]
*  and we have to end this war because it's different than just these skirmishes and [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6395.2s)]
*  smashing up parts of the world, which is also awful what they did with, you know, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6401.599999999999s)]
*  what Obama and Hillary Clinton administration did to Libya was just dreadfully awful. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6405.36s)]
*  And you could saw that you killed all those people for no reason, for no reason. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6410.28s)]
*  And then what's happening in Europe and they did the people who are leaving and it's still a [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6413.44s)]
*  mess there. That is something that that's, that's a war crime. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6416.4s)]
*  That that's a human rights violation. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6419.44s)]
*  And we got to stop this war because this, this guy has the most nuclear weapons and [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6422.44s)]
*  I'm saying he's going to use it. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6428.08s)]
*  We might. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6429.56s)]
*  But if you push, you keep poking a bear in the eye enough, that bear is going to lash [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6430.68s)]
*  out and do something. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6437.4800000000005s)]
*  And 300, over 350,000 Russians died, have died at least in this war. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6438.76s)]
*  That's like seven, eight Vietnam's for us over a 19 year period for us. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6444.32s)]
*  They lost more people in World War Two. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6449.76s)]
*  They're the ones that won. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6451.76s)]
*  World War Two, they 20 million people, they know what that sacrifice is and they're not [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6454.16s)]
*  going to bend for this. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6460.2s)]
*  We have to, it's not going to be perfect. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6461.52s)]
*  Like in any divorce, Ukraine's not going to get everything they want. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6463.2s)]
*  Russia's not going to get everything you want, but there has to be a cessation of human [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6466.68s)]
*  carnage. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6472.16s)]
*  This has to stop and whatever we got to do to do that, whoever administration is going [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6473.0s)]
*  to do that. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6477.56s)]
*  And the Republicans also have spinelessly, you know, Senator Graham is just a [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6478.200000000001s)]
*  warmongering weasel. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6483.96s)]
*  We have to, these people need to be kicked out of office, even if they're replaced by [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6485.72s)]
*  party that I don't, I'm not fond of right now. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6489.72s)]
*  We've got to get rid of these people who, and if you are for war, get rid of them, vote [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6492.96s)]
*  them out. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6497.56s)]
*  If you find out who your senator and congressman are voting for so that we can end [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6497.88s)]
*  this and stop it. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6502.04s)]
*  As a Christian, what do you make of politicians who call themselves Christians and then [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6504.96s)]
*  cheerlead and vote to fund carnage that doesn't help anyone, that results only in [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6510.08s)]
*  killing? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6515.96s)]
*  Like is that, that doesn't seem like a Christian position to me. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6516.36s)]
*  They are hypocrites and they are hypocrites because not only are they continuing to [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6519.5199999999995s)]
*  slaughter, but they're also financially benefiting from it. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6524.639999999999s)]
*  So you have like, I mean, at least in some ways, the cat's out of the bag. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6527.5199999999995s)]
*  Biden, what's left of Biden admitted that the money's not leaving the country, it's [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6532.400000000001s)]
*  just going down the street to the pharmaceutical, I'm sorry, to the military industrial [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6538.68s)]
*  complex. Raytheon's got that, these hundred billions. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6542.72s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6545.32s)]
*  It's like, no, let us worry. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6546.68s)]
*  Let us worry very much that we are exporting this murder, that we're exporting the [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6549.68s)]
*  slaughter and the taxpayers and then the congressmen also are, can invest in this. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6554.84s)]
*  You know, congressmen, senators, I mean, that can make money off the slaughter. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6560.0s)]
*  That, that is truly evil. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6564.88s)]
*  I agree with you completely. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6567.68s)]
*  So we need to stop that and hopefully this will, this new election will, will bring [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6569.52s)]
*  about an end to it. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6575.88s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6576.76s)]
*  We can't let it spread and we can't let it fester and it's not going to be perfect, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6577.76s)]
*  but no divorce, no end of war is, but it has to stop. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6581.0s)]
*  So I want to circle back to where it began, which is your conversion or your evolution [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6585.52s)]
*  through Christianity, Catholicism. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6590.52s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6592.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, there's two beautiful things. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6594.84s)]
*  One is to know that, that there is far too many stars in the, in the sky that are [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6598.360000000001s)]
*  necessary for the universe to continue. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6606.76s)]
*  It seems to be, and there's far too much spermazoa and flowers for flowers to continue. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6610.12s)]
*  And they don't need to be that beautiful color. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6614.96s)]
*  There seems to be an exuberance in creation. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6617.6s)]
*  There's just too much. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6619.92s)]
*  And there seems to be a celebration, a celestial whoopee, as Alan Watts would say. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6620.72s)]
*  And, and that's a really beautiful thing. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6626.56s)]
*  And there's too much exuberance in nature. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6628.6s)]
*  I love that. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6631.16s)]
*  And there, there's, there's definitely a joyfulness to all of it. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6632.08s)]
*  And it's like, wow, look at that. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6635.2s)]
*  Sometimes you look up at the clouds and you go like, that's as beautiful as anything [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6636.5199999999995s)]
*  that Monet could have ever made. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6641.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6643.2s)]
*  And it's temporary and everything is temporary. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6643.599999999999s)]
*  So that's like the, when you realize that the pyramids are at their half life, 5,000 [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6646.36s)]
*  years and in 5,000 years, there'll be dust. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6652.4s)]
*  And they go like, wow, how much more so us? [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6654.12s)]
*  And, and if you think, if our works, whatever we do, if you think our, our good [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6657.44s)]
*  works are but dirty rags in the face of the Lord, how much more our pride, our [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6664.12s)]
*  vanity. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6671.16s)]
*  So that came to me by having children and the incredible beauty and gift that they [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6673.08s)]
*  are and how they see the world and that their eyes point out to see everything. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6683.76s)]
*  And that they know that they're connected to everything and they have to be taught [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6688.48s)]
*  that there's a separation between them and their mother. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6691.0s)]
*  This is something that they just naturally, they know they're a part of everything. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6693.639999999999s)]
*  When the astronauts look back from the moon, if they ever went, they, they saw one [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6696.679999999999s)]
*  thing, if they had gone, if they had gone on the set that they were on, where they [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6703.44s)]
*  were shown a picture in Laurel Canyon, I think he saw the picture of earth and they [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6707.639999999999s)]
*  saw one thing and where that one thing. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6711.84s)]
*  And then at the same time, when this is coming to me and my beautiful children are [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6715.16s)]
*  that I'm having a second chance at to be the father, be a better father this time, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6720.52s)]
*  a more present father to see the rise of evil in the world and to be concerned about [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6726.92s)]
*  that and to know that now is the time to be courageous. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6733.0s)]
*  Now is the time for people to step up and say injustice, whether it's the current [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6738.200000000001s)]
*  attack on women, whether it's the educational system, not educating kids. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6742.88s)]
*  I say, take your kids out of college right now. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6749.0s)]
*  Now is not the time to let your kids come. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6751.08s)]
*  Who would, how much do you have to hate your kids to send them to Harvard undergrad? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6754.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6758.2s)]
*  I agree completely. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6758.400000000001s)]
*  The business schools are great. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6759.400000000001s)]
*  Don't them still going good. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6760.4800000000005s)]
*  They're all conservative too. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6761.92s)]
*  80%. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6762.84s)]
*  But, um, so you see a rise in evil and you have to know that like, this is happening. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6763.72s)]
*  And I've been very blessed that I got to meet some people who educated me about, you [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6770.96s)]
*  know, evil and in a meeting Dr. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6774.92s)]
*  M. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6777.32s)]
*  Scott Peck, when I was young, young man, um, and reading his books about this first [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6777.4400000000005s)]
*  self-health book was, was, was his, it was the road less traveled. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6784.2s)]
*  And it was a book about how to be a better person, how to grow as a human being [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6787.88s)]
*  spiritually and not take the easy road of just repetitive behavior or just not [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6791.04s)]
*  learning, not growing, but take the harder road, becoming a better person, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6795.88s)]
*  learning, loving, being tolerant, being forgiving, being patient, which is you [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6799.360000000001s)]
*  could easily see how we transitioned into Christianity because he was a [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6804.52s)]
*  Christian without saying he was just already had the, the followings of Jesus [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6808.0s)]
*  in his heart. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6812.68s)]
*  And so it was a natural opening and he had a very interesting story about him. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6813.8s)]
*  About how he was the doctor and the murder of the massacre of my life, which [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6820.400000000001s)]
*  is the Vietnam massacre in the late sixties. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6824.4800000000005s)]
*  And he was assigned as a psychologist to, of by the army, the U S army, uh, to, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6827.08s)]
*  um, kind of figure out the, um, psychological makeup of the company Baker [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6834.4800000000005s)]
*  who did the massacre. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6840.04s)]
*  And so he did. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6842.12s)]
*  And it was very interesting. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6843.96s)]
*  His findings. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6844.84s)]
*  One, one thing is the only reason what we ever learned about the [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6845.72s)]
*  massacre of, of, of my life was, um, was because the helicopter pilot who [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6847.76s)]
*  witnessed it flying above, couldn't live with it anymore. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6852.76s)]
*  And so a year later to the day, he confessed and just said, well, this is [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6858.24s)]
*  what happened. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6863.52s)]
*  This is, this is what these people were massacred. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6864.4800000000005s)]
*  And so during that psychological evaluation, um, which the army never [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6866.96s)]
*  released, he said that these people want, or people wasn't like these particular [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6872.84s)]
*  company had members in it that were, that had some grievances and that they, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6879.52s)]
*  that they, um, you know, had other issues and problems. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6883.52s)]
*  And some of them maybe had, uh, joined the army for, to avoid this or that, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6887.320000000001s)]
*  or were in prison or whatever. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6892.6s)]
*  And then that also was just one aspect of it. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6894.200000000001s)]
*  The other aspect of it is that they were being in a war that, um, wasn't [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6897.040000000001s)]
*  as much support back home. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6905.280000000001s)]
*  So they were, and they were going through and they're getting sniped at by the [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6907.639999999999s)]
*  enemy sniper fire, and they were killing their friends and they weren't able to [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6910.5599999999995s)]
*  get the enemy, they weren't able to get them. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6914.12s)]
*  Um, and they just kept happening. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6916.32s)]
*  And it's by the time they got to a village is it, where is it? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6917.92s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6920.639999999999s)]
*  Where are they? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6921.92s)]
*  And that the people, and this is something that's interesting because it [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6922.72s)]
*  reflected on my childhood because Asian people, when they are nervous, when they [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6926.12s)]
*  are frightened, they laugh. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6930.96s)]
*  That is true when like all my relatives, when they are nervous or when they, they [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6933.360000000001s)]
*  laugh, that's their go-to thing. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6938.120000000001s)]
*  So when the Vietnamese people who were having guns pointed at them were [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6939.76s)]
*  nervous and afraid, they laughed. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6943.4400000000005s)]
*  And that these people went ballistic at that point and just murdered the [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6946.120000000001s)]
*  entire village, just murdered them all. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6948.96s)]
*  Killed them all. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6951.360000000001s)]
*  Um, and so he did this and handed it in and, um, the army never released it. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6952.360000000001s)]
*  So moving further, um, he wrote a book about, um, after he became, uh, he became [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6960.12s)]
*  a Christian and then wrote a book about, um, healing human evil called, called [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6967.599999999999s)]
*  people of the lie. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6973.08s)]
*  And it's a short book, but very good book about evil. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6974.28s)]
*  And it's important now to identify and to help heal human evil. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6977.08s)]
*  And it's a, it's a fascinating book, but it helps you identify people in your [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6983.08s)]
*  life and people who, um, are capable and who are, who are evil. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6987.44s)]
*  And evil does exist and we need to, uh, arm ourselves with, uh, with God and [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=6992.44s)]
*  arm ourselves with knowledge so we can protect ourselves for what's, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7000.839999999999s)]
*  what's a rise in evil. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7003.759999999999s)]
*  And, um, the last chapter of the book, well, one of the chapters, which is [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7005.679999999999s)]
*  really stunningly awful was this one kid was depressed and he went to go see [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7010.679999999999s)]
*  Dr. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7015.28s)]
*  M. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7015.56s)]
*  Scott Peck and he found out that his brother had killed himself. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7015.64s)]
*  And, um, and he realized this is a really good kid, you know, and he's [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7020.92s)]
*  depressed, obviously his brother killed. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7026.0s)]
*  And then he found out that for, um, birthday present his parents gave him a [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7027.52s)]
*  gun, it's like that, which is absolutely stunned and, uh, but it wasn't just [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7032.52s)]
*  that it was the same gun that his brother killed himself with. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7037.84s)]
*  So there was a realization these, and he talked to the parents and realized [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7043.2s)]
*  there were, these were evil people. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7047.5199999999995s)]
*  And so that potentiality for human evil, we need to recognize and help heal, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7050.36s)]
*  protect ourselves, protect our families. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7060.0s)]
*  And, um, the last chapter on it, which is a demonic and satanic possession. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7062.32s)]
*  And it was like, you know, I'm reading this book at three o'clock in the [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7069.52s)]
*  morning at this point, I'm starting to freak out like this. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7073.400000000001s)]
*  And, um, but he postulated this theory. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7076.240000000001s)]
*  He said, like the people who seem to be, um, possessed seem to be very angelic [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7078.96s)]
*  people that this entity is trying to overtake and they're fighting back for [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7086.320000000001s)]
*  it to free themselves and evil. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7092.76s)]
*  Even evil, it has to succumb to the will of Jesus Christ and must submit to it. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7096.8s)]
*  And, um, um, which he, the theory that he postulates, well, this is [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7105.84s)]
*  somebody who's fighting back. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7112.84s)]
*  So therefore it makes sense that there are people that don't fight back and [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7115.12s)]
*  just accept it and go with that. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7118.52s)]
*  And that kind of, that demonic possession becomes complete. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7119.76s)]
*  And I think we have to, we have to, um, to know that that's, uh, that's something [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7123.68s)]
*  that, um, exists as real human evil, whatever you want to call it. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7132.160000000001s)]
*  And so what Dr. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7136.52s)]
*  M. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7137.4800000000005s)]
*  Scott Peck in the bigger picture tried to explain was that like, obviously [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7137.56s)]
*  science and theology had to split at a certain point to survive because [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7141.280000000001s)]
*  theology was, um, crushing science. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7145.120000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7149.280000000001s)]
*  When you have, um, when Copernicus discovers that the sun is a solar, you [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7150.320000000001s)]
*  know, the beginning of the middle of our solar system, not the earth, and it's [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7155.4400000000005s)]
*  not part of the church doctrine that has to be recanted, obviously science had [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7159.6s)]
*  to split. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7167.04s)]
*  So you had the, the, the laws of nature, which is just, you know, they just took [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7167.6s)]
*  the lawmaker out and they still laws, you know, just like we have the [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7174.6s)]
*  theological laws. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7179.6s)]
*  So when you have that separation, what Dr. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7180.88s)]
*  M. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7182.84s)]
*  Scott Peck tried to do is to bring it back together. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7182.92s)]
*  So when somebody's like a murderer, somebody's bad, you know, in science, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7185.200000000001s)]
*  medicine, you call them sick, theologically, you call them evil. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7189.08s)]
*  They're one in the same. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7192.84s)]
*  So in the attempt to cure human evil, I think it's, um, it makes us, we need [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7194.160000000001s)]
*  to, to do both and to work together. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7200.64s)]
*  And I think through, through bringing people closer to God, bringing our [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7203.56s)]
*  nation, which was founded under God. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7207.76s)]
*  I think we have a chance to heal our nation and, and cause there is a rise in [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7210.24s)]
*  evil and I think we all see it. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7214.16s)]
*  So it's, it sounds like you're saying the rise in evil turned you toward God. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7215.68s)]
*  Well, I think, I think both bookends, the beauty of it and my children and the [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7220.52s)]
*  beauty of, of seeing, of seeing what God's gifts are. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7224.04s)]

*  I had my father was American. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7571.48s)]
*  Her father was an American soldier, which he didn't meet until she was older. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7572.84s)]
*  So she came to accent, she's go by accident. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7575.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, but she said, I love this country. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7578.04s)]
*  Don't anybody ever say anything bad about this country ever. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7580.32s)]
*  I love this country. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7582.5599999999995s)]
*  And she did with a passion. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7584.0s)]
*  People who come here from, and had, you know, from other countries, they get it. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7585.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7589.639999999999s)]
*  They understand what an incredible, unique society and what this offers. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7590.4s)]
*  So that, that was drill into my head. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7596.88s)]
*  You said you wanted to end on a prayer. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7601.24s)]
*  Yes, I would. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7603.0s)]
*  I'd like to end. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7604.24s)]
*  Um, I'd like to end on something that my friend said right, right before this, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7605.28s)]
*  this new flap in the media about me. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7612.96s)]
*  He said, what an incredible coincidence. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7615.16s)]
*  And there is no coincidence. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7616.679999999999s)]
*  Everything's meant. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7617.72s)]
*  This is a reflection for the day. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7619.12s)]
*  August 10th. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7621.8s)]
*  We've been our own worst enemies most of our lives. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7623.36s)]
*  And we've often injured ourselves seriously as a result of a [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7626.599999999999s)]
*  justified resentment or a slight wrong. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7630.28s)]
*  Doubtless. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7633.76s)]
*  There are many causes for resentment in the world. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7634.2s)]
*  Most of them providing justification, but we can never begin to settle all the [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7636.76s)]
*  world's grievances or even arrange things. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7641.679999999999s)]
*  So as to please everybody, if we've been treated unjustly by others or simply by [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7644.48s)]
*  life itself, we can avoid compounding the difficulty by completely forgiving the [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7649.639999999999s)]
*  persons involved and abandoning the destructive habit of reviewing our [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7654.64s)]
*  hurts and humiliations. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7659.6s)]
*  So I would say, um, thank you for this time. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7663.160000000001s)]
*  Thank you for this time, Jesus. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7668.92s)]
*  And I'll, I'm allowing me to speak my mind with this wonderful conversation and [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7669.96s)]
*  with my new friend Tucker and God bless this great country and protect your [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7675.4800000000005s)]
*  children. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7679.68s)]
*  God bless my daughter and God bless all the daughters and all the people that [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7680.04s)]
*  are having problems in the world. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7683.76s)]
*  And we thank you for all these opportunities that you give us in Jesus name. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7684.96s)]
*  We pray in the name of the father, the son, the Holy spirit. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7688.92s)]
*  Amen. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7690.8s)]
*  Amen. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7691.4400000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7692.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7693.4800000000005s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7694.320000000001s)]
*  I know shocking that in an election year with everything at stake, Google would [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7698.4800000000005s)]
*  be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing anything that [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7703.8s)]
*  the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7709.280000000001s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7710.76s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7712.320000000001s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, but that's a waste of time. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7713.24s)]
*  I'm not in charge of Google, or we could find a way around it. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7716.24s)]
*  The way that you could actually get information. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7719.36s)]
*  That's true. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7721.88s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7723.36s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think is to subscribe to our channel, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7725.4s)]
*  subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance of hearing what we say. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7729.36s)]
*  And we hope you will. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vyjLVW_8s&t=7734.12s)]
