# Billy Bush Reveals NBC's Secret Attempt to End Trump’s Candidacy, and Why It Failed Miserably
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM)
*  When you realize, I mean, you obviously learned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=0.0s)]
*  the hard way I did too, but the people who run [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2.88s)]
*  the business are just not good people. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5.14s)]
*  There's some friendly people, there's certainly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=8.14s)]
*  some smart people, there are some people [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=9.88s)]
*  who are good people, but in general, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=12.96s)]
*  I worked at three different TV networks full time [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=14.74s)]
*  and then two others part time, and I just found [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=18.78s)]
*  as a rule management, they just weren't people [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=21.42s)]
*  you would make the godparents to your kids. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=24.42s)]
*  A lot of people are afraid, I mean, I just think it's like. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=28.54s)]
*  Certainly linear television, now the big companies, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=29.56s)]
*  I think people are terrified. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=32.76s)]
*  You see, management, they don't know where [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=34.48s)]
*  they're gonna be the next day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=36.96s)]
*  ["The Next Day"] [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=38.84s)]
*  ["The Next Day"] [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=41.5s)]
*  So leadership is hard to find, and gutsy leadership. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=59.24s)]
*  You look back at the days of great sitcom television, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=64.4s)]
*  you look at Brandon Tartikoff and Grant Tinker [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=68.66s)]
*  and some of these great legends that said, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=71.74s)]
*  you know what, we're gonna stick with this Seinfeld bomb. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=74.14s)]
*  The ratings are terrible, but what a, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=78.54s)]
*  there's something there and we're gonna hold onto it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=81.22s)]
*  And we're just, that, as your audience is shrinking [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=83.54s)]
*  and the gains are shrinking, people are just terrified. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=89.78s)]
*  They're looking over their shoulder, they're wondering, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=93.54s)]
*  am I the next to get fired? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=95.54s)]
*  I mean, that's absolutely right. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  I forgot Seinfeld was a bomb at first. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=98.92s)]
*  It was not doing well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=100.68s)]
*  I totally forgot that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  Imagine someone pulling that off the air. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=103.84s)]
*  They would do it now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=105.72s)]
*  Didn't work after two episodes or three episodes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  This didn't work after a year or two years. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  No, it's incredible. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=112.36000000000001s)]
*  The runway though, because they were making so much money. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=113.2s)]
*  NBC was making money in every category then. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  And it had some good lead in and all that stuff, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=117.84s)]
*  and then they stuck with it, and now it's, you know, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  it makes more money and reruns still [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=123.22s)]
*  than most original shows. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=126.5s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=128.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=129.06s)]
*  You start, you've been in TV for like 30 years, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=129.9s)]
*  or in broadcasting certainly for 30 years. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=132.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=134.18s)]
*  I still think though, even when the business [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=135.9s)]
*  was making a ton of money, it was a dishonest business. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=138.38s)]
*  That's the way it felt to me anyway when I started at CNN. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=144.78s)]
*  I look at all the places I've been, it's, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=146.58s)]
*  I think of the moral high ground. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=148.74s)]
*  Like it doesn't exist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=154.44s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  People, you know, grappling for the moral high ground, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  anyone who gets fired based upon, you know, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  for moral purposes, they try to use the morality clause, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=162.28s)]
*  which every talent has in their contract, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  the morality clause, they lunge for it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=167.44s)]
*  This is coming from people who don't have a leg to stand on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=170.0s)]
*  when it comes to that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=173.68s)]
*  It's like, it's just a big laugh. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  Everyone, you know, the firers are all [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  completely morally compromised. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=181.22s)]
*  So, so well that's, I mean. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=183.3s)]
*  I would just look at each other, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  let's all look at each other for a second. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=189.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=191.3s)]
*  Do any of us belong standing on this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=192.12s)]
*  This is all about gain. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  Okay, who's up, who's down? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=195.74s)]
*  And then why? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=197.62s)]
*  No, I, of course I know what you're talking about. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=199.06s)]
*  And I think that from, I mean, I'm obviously long out of it, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  but I think of that from afar when I see these people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=204.68s)]
*  getting all huffy about this or that moral transgression. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=207.5s)]
*  I'm like, wait a second. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=209.86s)]
*  You know, you slept with my intern, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=211.9s)]
*  you killed your own intern or whatever. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=213.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=215.62s)]
*  Let's call the whole thing off. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=216.94s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=218.58s)]
*  But why, just like general question, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=220.02s)]
*  but why not just call you in and say, you know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=222.86s)]
*  this isn't working for us financially. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=227.02s)]
*  Why do they feel the need to dress it up? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  Not, I'm not speaking specifically of you, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=231.46s)]
*  but it's always like. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=233.28s)]
*  Well, that's the Megyn Kelly situation, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=234.72s)]
*  I mean, I love Megyn. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=236.56s)]
*  Why not call her in and say, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=237.44s)]
*  we gave you way too big a budget. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=238.76s)]
*  This is giant and the ratings aren't there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=241.16s)]
*  And also you're doing something different. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=243.48s)]
*  Megyn, I love Megyn. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=245.06s)]
*  She's a friend. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=246.6s)]
*  She was a ferocious attorney interviewing people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  at nine o'clock at night. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=251.44s)]
*  And then, you know, the daytime show with the, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=252.84s)]
*  da da da da, it's, you know, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=255.28s)]
*  like here's the fresh muffins, everybody. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=256.64s)]
*  And you know, it just, all of a sudden it's like, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=258.52s)]
*  well, let's say Martha Stewart years ago [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  had a version of The Apprentice. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=263.18s)]
*  After Donald Trump had The Apprentice, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=264.64s)]
*  they gave one to Martha. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=266.5s)]
*  They thought that would be great. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=267.58s)]
*  But Martha had a different idea. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=268.62s)]
*  Her idea was, I'm gonna write sweet handwritten notes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=270.52s)]
*  on Pink Stationery. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=274.14s)]
*  I'm sorry, we have to let you go. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  No, that's not the Martha we want. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=276.9s)]
*  The Martha we want, the Martha we love is cold and tough. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=278.74s)]
*  And a nut cutter. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=282.46s)]
*  Yeah, a nut cutter. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  You're outta here, bitch, you're gone. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=284.26s)]
*  That's the Martha we wanted. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=286.84s)]
*  So, you know, this is, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=288.9s)]
*  it happens that you have to stay, I guess, you know. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  But Meghan is such a great example though. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=295.4s)]
*  So they hire Meghan. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=297.56s)]
*  She's, you know, got a kind of a- [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=299.76s)]
*  Fired by the same man that fired me. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=301.84s)]
*  And instead of saying, hey, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=304.17999999999995s)]
*  the ratings don't match the $40 million a year budget, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=306.84s)]
*  or whatever it is, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=311.2s)]
*  they fire Meghan for asking a question [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=312.9s)]
*  about when Blackface fell out of vogue [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=316.26s)]
*  or was not acceptable at all for Halloween and things. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=321.38s)]
*  I mean, remember, think of all the late night comics [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=324.66s)]
*  who are working today that used to regularly do Blackface [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=327.54s)]
*  on their shows, okay? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=330.74s)]
*  And there was a time where, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=333.66s)]
*  if a girl dressed up as Diana Ross, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  it was like she legitimately loved Diana Ross. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=337.1s)]
*  But then, you know, all Meghan did was ask the question, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  when, give me a year or a period when that became [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=346.38s)]
*  absolutely unacceptable to the point [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=352.3s)]
*  that your career and everything will be taken away from you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=354.26s)]
*  So asking that was the equivalent [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=356.68s)]
*  of like lynching a bunch of people in Mississippi. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then they trucked out, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=359.8s)]
*  different people from the network. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=361.44s)]
*  And, you know, Al Roker and Craig Melvin came out [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  and they did a show and they talked about [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  how horrible it was. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=368.48s)]
*  And so they sent Meghan on her way. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=370.76s)]
*  And they said, you know, what Meghan did, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=373.02s)]
*  I think is what you did, and said, absolutely not. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=374.4s)]
*  You'll pay me out in full. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=377.58s)]
*  My contract will be paid. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=380.26s)]
*  And I think Meghan got all 60 some million dollars [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=382.14s)]
*  or whatever it was to then go off [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  and build what she's built, which is pretty awesome. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=387.18s)]
*  She's tough, she's a tough woman. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  She's tough. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  And she got tougher going through that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=393.2s)]
*  And I think like a lot of people I've known, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=395.94s)]
*  you either become a better person or a worse person, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=397.76s)]
*  and she became, I think, a better person, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  and she's a wonderful person. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=401.24s)]
*  One of my favorite people, actually. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  So I think it was, you know, a huge victory for her [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=405.06s)]
*  on every level, personally and professionally. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=408.58s)]
*  I was proud of her. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=410.38s)]
*  She didn't do anything wrong, but ask a question. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=411.22s)]
*  She never said, we should be allowed to do blackface again. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=414.02s)]
*  She didn't say that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=417.82s)]
*  She said, when was the, all she did was raise the question. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=419.08s)]
*  Now remember, this is also retribution. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=422.38s)]
*  The man that was the chairman of NBC News at the time [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=424.22s)]
*  who fired her, she had recently put out, you know, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=426.92s)]
*  an email calling him a liar. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Who was that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=435.68s)]
*  To the staff, Andy Lack. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  She called Andy Lack a liar because she said, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=437.88s)]
*  wait a minute, we have someone who has corroborated, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=440.44s)]
*  you know, Rose McGowan, the actress, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=444.32s)]
*  we have a, who corroborated that, you know, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=446.16s)]
*  this in the Me Too movement with, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=448.8s)]
*  in this whole Weinstein case. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  So just to refresh for people who don't recall, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=453.36s)]
*  the allegation was, and I think it was true, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=456.04s)]
*  that NBC had the goods on Harvey Weinstein [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  that he was behaving in an abusive way, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=462.44s)]
*  in a legit abusive way toward women. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Ronan Farrow was doing his report. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=466.44s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=468.08s)]
*  And they sat on it? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=470.0s)]
*  And Ronan alleges that they sat on it and said, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=471.48s)]
*  you don't have enough, you don't have anyone [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=476.44s)]
*  who's on camera and in name, and Megan said, wait a minute, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=478.16s)]
*  yeah, Rose McGowan, in camera, on camera, in name, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=481.36s)]
*  we've got a name, she'll go. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=485.08s)]
*  And they, I guess, overlooked that, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=487.16s)]
*  or refused to acknowledge it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=491.2s)]
*  And so, but the idea was that, you know, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=492.92s)]
*  the guy who was president of NBC News at the time [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=498.0s)]
*  is Noah Oppenheim, and he's a scriptwriter. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=500.8s)]
*  He's really a scriptwriter. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=504.36s)]
*  And he's so, you know, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=506.56s)]
*  does he wanna write scripts for Harvey, who knows? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=510.12s)]
*  But there's that relationship, and Harvey, you know, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=512.88s)]
*  was never afraid to pick up the phone. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=515.28s)]
*  I've had Harvey Weinstein call me, this is a great film, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=517.12s)]
*  you should have this on your show on Access Hollywood [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=520.04s)]
*  when I was the host, you know, hammering me to have a, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  he was, you know, an animal. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  So he, it seems very likely that he was applying pressure [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=529.12s)]
*  to executives at NBC, including Noah Oppenheim. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=533.12s)]
*  Yeah, it seems likely. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=535.88s)]
*  You have to assume. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, he would apply pressure to anyone. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=537.8s)]
*  If he's, if little Billy Bush over at Access Hollywood [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=540.04s)]
*  is getting pressure, then you know that Today Show is. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=542.5999999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=544.76s)]
*  So Megan pipes up and says, actually, Andy Lack, her boss, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=545.76s)]
*  what you're saying is not quite right, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=550.56s)]
*  and they decide we gotta kill this woman. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=552.4s)]
*  Yeah, so it's retribution. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=555.04s)]
*  Clean and simple retribution. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=557.36s)]
*  And I'm sure Megan's lawyer, Brian Friedman, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=559.28s)]
*  who's one of the best lawyers in this game, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=561.24s)]
*  turned and said, oh no, you're not gonna just. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=567.92s)]
*  She has done absolutely nothing wrong. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=568.92s)]
*  Nice try, you can try and brand her a racist, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  which she is not. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=573.84s)]
*  She's not gonna be a racist for asking a question, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=576.44s)]
*  but you are gonna pay her out in full. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  And then she's gonna go build her own network, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=581.08s)]
*  and by the way, I saw last week that Megan [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=583.24s)]
*  surpassed NBC News in YouTube views on her own. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=586.44s)]
*  That's so great. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  So she was crowing about that, and I have to say, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=592.36s)]
*  I smiled. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=595.16s)]
*  I'm in the comments section if you look down, by the way. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=596.0s)]
*  Way to go, girl. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  I love it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=600.0s)]
*  So why, and I'd forgotten this part of it, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=600.84s)]
*  are two hosts on NBC, both black, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=603.12s)]
*  and they torpedoed Megan? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=607.0s)]
*  Look, play ball or not, right? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=611.12s)]
*  I mean, they were asked to appear and talk about [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  the severity of it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  The severity of it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=620.12s)]
*  The severity of blackface and appropriation [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=622.84s)]
*  and all these things. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=626.76s)]
*  Look, these types of situations are offered to you, right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=629.32s)]
*  I mean, play ball with the big machine, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=633.64s)]
*  or maybe you're out next, too. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=634.7199999999999s)]
*  I will say this, Craig Melvin is a really good guy. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  I like him a lot. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  For the two months that I was at the Today Show, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=641.56s)]
*  he had the office next to mine, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=643.3599999999999s)]
*  and we would call in response, sing. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  I liked the guy so much, I would go, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=647.64s)]
*  it's a beautiful morning, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  and then he would finish the lyric, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=653.52s)]
*  and he was just a charmingly lovely guy. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=654.92s)]
*  Roker, on the other hand, is a bit vindictive. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=658.16s)]
*  He's the, he's not jovial. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=660.72s)]
*  He's- [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=665.12s)]
*  No? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=665.96s)]
*  Because you do think fat people are jovial, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=666.8000000000001s)]

*  and I just got there, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=695.48s)]
*  a producer of mine called me and said, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  hey, Al Roker just liked a tweet [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  from someone calling you a white-splaining racist. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  I said, what? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=710.28s)]
*  So I looked and I said, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=711.8s)]
*  wait, I'm on the air with him every day. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=712.64s)]

*  So I went to my boss, the head of the Today Show, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=715.84s)]
*  Noah Oppenheim, and I said, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=719.52s)]
*  hey, dude, I can't sit on the air with someone [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=721.9200000000001s)]

*  that are insane. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=728.24s)]
*  I haven't done anything of the kind, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=730.36s)]
*  I don't know what that even means. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=731.44s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=732.4s)]
*  So he's like, oh my God, I'm so sorry, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=734.0s)]
*  and he had to go talk to- [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  He talked, I'll talk to him! [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  But you gotta file him under the group [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=738.52s)]
*  of people who did not want me there, right? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=740.0s)]
*  So there's a group that didn't, and you know, Matt Lauer- [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=742.2800000000001s)]
*  Did Broker ever say, I think you're a racist? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=744.76s)]

*  But like this thing, but I could feel like [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=750.72s)]
*  when I got to the Today Show, there was definitely- [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=754.52s)]
*  Wait, where'd you been, just get- [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=759.2s)]
*  Access Hollywood for 15 years. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=761.2s)]
*  Okay, in LA. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=763.24s)]
*  Let me give you the brief of how I got to the Today Show. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=764.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=766.84s)]
*  I built some leverage. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=768.64s)]
*  I got a relationship with the woman [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=770.12s)]
*  who was the head of talent for ABC News Good Morning America. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=773.4s)]
*  Who was that? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  Her name was Barbara Fredita. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=778.16s)]
*  She ended up offering me a job. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=780.04s)]
*  Ben Sherwood was running ABC News at the time. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  They offered me a job for Good Morning America, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=789.0s)]
*  to leave Access Hollywood and become [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=791.16s)]
*  like a national correspondent, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=793.12s)]
*  but rotating in in the studio, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=794.56s)]
*  and get your shot, basically. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=796.1999999999999s)]
*  Getting back to me even more, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  how'd you end up on Access Hollywood? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=800.0799999999999s)]
*  I was, I did something local. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=802.04s)]
*  I did some local feature reports back at WNBC in New York, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=804.56s)]
*  after doing radio for six years. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=809.12s)]
*  Started in radio in New Hampshire, of all places, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=811.52s)]
*  right out of college. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=814.8s)]
*  Then I went to DC, had my own morning show there for five years. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  Like a morning zoo type of morning show. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=820.4399999999999s)]
*  And then I did this local thing. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=826.0799999999999s)]
*  On television, just my own feature reports, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=829.84s)]
*  fun stuff that I would write and edit, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=832.28s)]
*  and like that made me laugh. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=834.04s)]
*  And people liked it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=836.12s)]
*  And so ultimately, they came to me and said, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=837.6s)]
*  what's your deal? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=841.28s)]
*  We'd like to have you, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=842.12s)]
*  we're looking for an East Coast correspondent [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=842.96s)]
*  for our show, Access Hollywood. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=845.48s)]
*  You'll get to do red carpets and meet all kinds of movie stars. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=846.84s)]
*  Okay, sounds good to me. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=849.6s)]
*  So that I started doing that in the end of 2001. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=852.88s)]
*  And moved to the Today Show in 2016. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=857.28s)]
*  I was there for 15 years. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=861.24s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=863.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was really fun in the beginning. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=865.0799999999999s)]
*  It was just awesome. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  Back when Must See TV was on Thursday night. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=869.0s)]
*  So the ratings were big, there was car service. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=871.52s)]
*  It was super fun. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=876.36s)]
*  I got to do all these events and I sort of moved my way up. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=877.28s)]
*  And in 2004, they moved me to Los Angeles [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=880.52s)]
*  to become the host of it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  And I'm out there until I said, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  God, am I gonna die doing this? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=888.32s)]
*  Like I gotta change it up. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  So I put this plan into effect to make some inroads. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=893.4s)]
*  But you could have stayed forever, right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=897.24s)]
*  Oh, I could have stayed forever. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=898.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=900.32s)]
*  But I really wanted to get to like a Regis Philbin style, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=901.28s)]
*  morning show. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=906.2s)]
*  Fun, warm. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=907.36s)]
*  And that was when I made the move to Good Morning America. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=908.6800000000001s)]
*  Then NBC said, wait a minute, whoa. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=911.8000000000001s)]
*  Leverages that thing. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=915.24s)]
*  They know when you have it or you don't. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=916.36s)]
*  They knew I had it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=918.28s)]
*  They knew I was moving. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=919.4s)]
*  And so they said, okay, we'll give you the nine o'clock hour [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=920.36s)]
*  at the Today Show. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=922.84s)]
*  It's yours, come on in. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=924.0400000000001s)]
*  When was that? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=926.2s)]
*  And that was 2000. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=927.4s)]
*  So I made the move. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=929.0400000000001s)]
*  My first day on the air at the Today Show [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=930.88s)]
*  was at the Rio Olympics in Brazil. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=933.4s)]
*  In the summer of 16. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=939.12s)]
*  In the summer of 16. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=940.24s)]
*  And my last day was October 7. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=942.4s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=944.76s)]
*  Sorry to laugh. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=947.04s)]
*  I should say. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=948.52s)]
*  It was exactly two months. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=949.36s)]
*  In the interest of honesty, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=950.1999999999999s)]
*  we went to high school together and dated sisters. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=951.04s)]
*  So we've known each other for a while. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=953.0799999999999s)]
*  We should get into that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=954.12s)]
*  We don't need to hear that, but I'm just saying. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=955.36s)]
*  Your wife's younger sister, my first love. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=957.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=960.56s)]
*  And so obviously I was watching all this carefully [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=961.52s)]
*  as it unfolded. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=966.48s)]
*  I felt phony not saying that. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=968.28s)]
*  So you're living in LA, wife and three kids. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=970.36s)]
*  You plan to move them back to the East Coast. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=974.4399999999999s)]
*  You go to Rio, big deal. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=977.76s)]
*  It's the Olympics. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=979.48s)]
*  NBC has the Olympics. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  This is how they're gonna roll you out. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=982.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=983.8s)]
*  Heck of a rollout. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=984.8s)]
*  Yeah, heck of a rollout. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=985.64s)]
*  Viewership's always up. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=986.48s)]
*  The whole thing. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=987.9599999999999s)]
*  It's the craziest viewership of the cycle. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=988.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=991.12s)]
*  And you get to Rio, I'll never forget this. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=992.12s)]
*  And you got basically under, like right away, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  the knives came out for you on staff. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=999.64s)]
*  Right away. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1001.72s)]
*  What happened? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1002.6s)]
*  Well, remember the Ryan Lochte story. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1006.32s)]
*  The Ryan Lochte story broke. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1008.8000000000001s)]
*  It was big. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1010.64s)]
*  Ryan Lochte was held at gunpoint overnight. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1011.48s)]
*  They went after swimming competitions. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1014.36s)]
*  He and some other swimmers went out, got drunk, partied. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1016.96s)]
*  And then they were at a gas station in Rio [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1020.04s)]
*  and they were held at gunpoint. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1022.04s)]
*  Anyway, we wake up this morning after this, read it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh my gosh, this story about Ryan Lochte. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1028.76s)]
*  Two hours later, somehow I run into Ryan Lochte [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1031.72s)]
*  and he's just bumbling down the street with vodka breath. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1034.68s)]
*  Just like, just. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1038.4s)]
*  No way. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1039.24s)]
*  But he's by himself and just bumbling. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1040.44s)]
*  And I've got an iPhone on me and I'm like, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1042.6399999999999s)]
*  this is a huge story. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1045.48s)]
*  We're just walking down the street in Rio. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1046.32s)]
*  This is one of our major athletes held at gunpoint [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1048.16s)]
*  in a foreign country at the Olympics. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1050.36s)]
*  This is massive. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1052.12s)]
*  I only have this. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1054.0s)]
*  So I give to my cohost and friend who's with me. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1055.68s)]
*  I said, roll this. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1058.52s)]
*  Lochte, come here. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1059.8400000000001s)]
*  And I pull him over and I said, roll the camera. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  I have a minute and 42 seconds still on here. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1063.44s)]
*  It's all I got before the Olympic committee, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1065.88s)]
*  US Olympic committee representatives saw me [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1068.2s)]
*  across the street talking to Ryan Lochte on an iPhone [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  and they buck over to stop me. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1074.76s)]
*  But I get him to tell me what happened. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1076.64s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1079.64s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, because the second week of the Olympics [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1080.88s)]
*  is always a little slow. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1083.44s)]
*  You got swimming and you got gymnastics [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1084.56s)]
*  and all the big things in the first week [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1087.24s)]
*  and it's only track and field. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like pole vaults. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1091.08s)]
*  And it's like, you need something else. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1092.08s)]
*  Like a storyline would be great. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1093.48s)]
*  All of a sudden we have Olympic athletes at gunpoint. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1094.84s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1097.9199999999998s)]
*  And Lochte tells me this story and I go on [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1099.24s)]
*  and well, it becomes something else. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1101.52s)]
*  I mean, first of all, Al Roker goes crazy on me [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1104.36s)]
*  and he's like, no, this American apologist stuff begins. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  And the narrative is set. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1109.96s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  So this seems like a legit scoop. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1112.48s)]
*  How could Ryan Lochte do this? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1113.48s)]
*  He's a terrible American with this entitled American [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1114.8s)]
*  bravado and his friends. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1120.84s)]
*  Cause he was apparently, he had torn down a poster [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1123.16s)]
*  outside of the bathroom of this gas station [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1126.16s)]
*  and all these terrible things that they were doing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1128.76s)]
*  No, they were held at gunpoint by terrible people. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1132.3600000000001s)]
*  And I said, wait a minute, we don't know that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1136.92s)]
*  This is live on the air. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1140.28s)]
*  Yeah, live on the air. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1141.28s)]
*  I said, wait a minute, we don't know that. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1142.12s)]
*  All we're getting is that Ryan Lochte [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1143.56s)]
*  did all these terrible things from the minister [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1145.28s)]
*  of information of the Rio police, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  not known to be the least corrupt police organization [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1152.2399999999998s)]
*  in the world. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1155.6799999999998s)]
*  Hello. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1156.52s)]
*  So I said, hang on for a second. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1157.6799999999998s)]
*  Why would we take that? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1160.76s)]
*  Cause it's like taking the minister of, you know, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1161.6s)]
*  in Gaza, they're making the minister, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1166.6s)]
*  you get his statistics. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1168.2399999999998s)]
*  Someone who's obviously biased. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1170.04s)]
*  So I said, okay, just calm down. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1172.32s)]
*  We don't know anything about what these guys did. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1176.56s)]
*  In the end, when everything came out, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1178.52s)]
*  Ryan Lochte didn't lie about anything but one thing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1181.2s)]
*  He said he was sitting at gunpoint. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1184.24s)]
*  He was actually kneeling at gunpoint. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1186.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1188.16s)]
*  So in other words, everything he said was totally true. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1189.08s)]
*  And the entire US media organization led by NBC [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1191.68s)]
*  as we're on the ground, totally savaged this guy. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1195.68s)]
*  Ryan Lochte? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1199.5600000000002s)]
*  Savaged him how a horrible American entitled, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1200.4s)]
*  you know, this, this apologist attitude has come, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1204.0s)]
*  you know, to, to think he can do anything he wants. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1207.5600000000002s)]
*  He was the victim of a violent crime. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1209.72s)]
*  Totally the victim. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1210.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1212.6000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think they did that? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1213.8400000000001s)]
*  And by the way, I want, and he capitulated [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1215.4s)]
*  and he like did this whole apology thing. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1217.64s)]
*  And he did an interview with Matt Lauer. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  He apologized for being held at gunpoint? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1220.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, he was like, I'm sorry. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1221.5200000000002s)]
*  I guess I did pull the thing down or the, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1222.64s)]
*  I don't know what. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1224.84s)]
*  He just apologized for what they told him to apologize for. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1225.9199999999998s)]
*  And in the end he did nothing. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1229.84s)]
*  He did nothing wrong. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1231.36s)]
*  Strong families are built on strong foundations. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1232.8799999999999s)]
*  And it all begins with what you bring into your home. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1235.56s)]
*  It's hard though, because big pharma [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1238.12s)]
*  and the processed food industry have spent decades [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1239.72s)]
*  putting you and your loved ones at risk, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1242.9199999999998s)]
*  pushing toxic, harmful products that make you sick, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1244.9599999999998s)]
*  that have made our country sick. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1248.84s)]
*  It's not a guess, that's happened. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1249.9599999999998s)]
*  So it's well past time that someone decided [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1251.8799999999999s)]
*  to help you fight back. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1254.2s)]
*  Public Square is doing that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1255.0800000000002s)]
*  Public Square is the leading family marketplace [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1257.3600000000001s)]
*  where you will find clean, healthy products [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  sourced from American small businesses [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1261.64s)]
*  that actually share your values. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1263.88s)]
*  Now is the time to abandon the corporate food conglomerates [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1266.28s)]
*  in favor of something better, healthier, more pure. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1269.72s)]
*  Make the switch, stock your home with the quality essentials [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1272.8400000000001s)]
*  and shop for gifts your whole family will love. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1275.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's easy, publicsquare.com slash Tucker. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1277.16s)]

*  Whatever happened to him, do you know? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1283.04s)]
*  No. Right. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1285.52s)]
*  I mean, he did a reality show for a minute or tried to. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1286.48s)]
*  Did he dance with the stars, Tucker, like you? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1291.24s)]
*  I don't know. I never did that, Billy. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1293.56s)]
*  Yes, you did. That's bullshit. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1295.12s)]
*  And you were terrible. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1297.04s)]
*  I didn't do that. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1298.12s)]
*  I think actually I was staying at your house during that. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1301.36s)]
*  Tom DeLay was worse, but you were bad. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1303.56s)]
*  Well, that's something. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1305.76s)]
*  But I still don't understand. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1309.48s)]
*  Like, this was basically a decision by, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1311.84s)]
*  this was from a viewer's perspective, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1314.56s)]
*  Al Roker decided to change the story and everyone followed him? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1316.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, he was sipping capparagnas within this cocktail. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1319.68s)]
*  And he started going after me like I'm defending, you know, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1323.44s)]
*  this Ryan Lochte who behaved like, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1326.08s)]
*  we need to be able to call out our own people [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1328.2s)]
*  who behave terribly and poor Ryan. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1330.16s)]
*  I said, we don't, you can pull it up on YouTube. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1332.04s)]
*  We don't have the information. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1336.2s)]
*  We don't know. Just wait. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1338.2s)]
*  Wait. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1340.72s)]
*  And then two weeks later, when the breeze blows through [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1342.0s)]
*  and everything's done, it comes out, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1344.48s)]
*  absolutely, Ryan Lochte told the truth. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1346.68s)]
*  What do you think Roker's so angry about? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1349.32s)]
*  I mean, he's like a weather guy on some morning show [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1351.56s)]
*  and he gets paid all this money and everyone's, you know, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1353.8s)]
*  thinks he's jolly. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1356.16s)]
*  Everybody wants to be more. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1357.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to be a great interviewer, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1357.88s)]
*  but you have to prepare for those and you have to be curious. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1359.52s)]
*  And that's just... [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1362.1200000000001s)]
*  But what's he mad about? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  He seems to have succeeded far beyond... [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1364.96s)]
*  I don't know. People in network, you know, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1367.6399999999999s)]
*  these big organizations are territorial, very territorial. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1371.08s)]
*  You can look back at the stories of, you know, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1375.28s)]
*  Ashley Banfield story of the big wigs ahead of her [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1377.44s)]
*  keeping her down, not wanting her to rise up. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1382.6s)]
*  I was always very close to Matt Lauer and Al Roker [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1385.0s)]
*  until I got to the Today Show. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1387.84s)]
*  And then I had like targets on my back [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1390.08s)]
*  from the moment I got there. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1392.72s)]
*  Both of them. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1393.8s)]
*  There's two worlds. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1394.6799999999998s)]
*  There's the, yeah. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1395.52s)]
*  And, you know, remember my relationship with them before [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1396.96s)]
*  was as the guy on Access Hollywood [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1401.1200000000001s)]
*  who basically would promote them. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1402.92s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1405.04s)]
*  Our job was to promote everything on NBC, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1405.96s)]
*  whether that's The Apprentice or whether that's the Today Show. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1409.44s)]
*  I am the chief rabble rouser entertainment guy. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1414.1200000000001s)]
*  We cover everything, but NBC stuff is first. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1417.24s)]
*  Yes, you can cover, you know, 24 on Fox, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1421.2s)]
*  but first cover Seinfeld because it's on NBC. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1424.8s)]
*  So we promote our own things. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1427.72s)]
*  It's just like a football announcer saying, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1429.68s)]
*  and tonight don't be, you know, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1431.36s)]
*  make sure you catch NCIS LA tonight at something on CBS. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1433.56s)]
*  It's a lot of promotion. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  Access Hollywood was basically a promotional vehicle. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1439.8s)]
*  So when I showed up as, no, I'm now one of you [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1442.44s)]
*  who could potentially replace you one day [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1446.92s)]
*  because you're old, older than I am. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1450.04s)]
*  And that's just the way it works. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1453.72s)]
*  Then, you know, you could feel the energy change. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1455.8400000000001s)]
*  So when I ultimately got fired from NBC, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  it was a lot to do with the inner workings, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1461.76s)]
*  the politics of being the new guy there. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1467.24s)]
*  What I find so interesting about it, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1471.0s)]
*  everything you're saying makes sense. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1473.44s)]
*  Of course, I've seen it a lot, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1474.68s)]
*  but what's interesting is that nobody said anything [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1475.92s)]
*  to your face that it was all feline, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1479.8s)]
*  passive aggression and treachery. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1481.92s)]
*  Yeah, I've written a, I have a great chapter that I wrote [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1484.0800000000002s)]
*  and I wrote it years ago so I wouldn't forget any details [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1488.1200000000001s)]
*  of what exactly happened with my firing. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1492.4s)]
*  And it was just, it was, it's unbelievable. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1496.0800000000002s)]
*  I was playing catch up the whole time. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1500.3200000000002s)]
*  I found out that the Access Hollywood bus tape [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1502.6000000000001s)]
*  was in the NBC News building by Matt Lauer. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1506.92s)]
*  He came to me after I got off the air at the Today Show [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1511.0s)]
*  on a Tuesday morning and he said, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1514.3999999999999s)]
*  "'Hey, what are you gonna do about the tape?' [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1515.6399999999999s)]
*  I said, "'What?' [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1517.7199999999998s)]
*  "'What do you mean, Matt?' [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1519.1999999999998s)]
*  And he said, "'The tape, the bus tape, you and Trump' [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1520.04s)]
*  and all that. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1522.6799999999998s)]
*  I said, "'What are you talking about?' [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1523.52s)]
*  I said, "'What do you mean?' [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1525.6s)]
*  And I knew what the, I remembered the tape. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1527.4399999999998s)]
*  It's 11 years old at the time.'" [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1530.08s)]
*  So back up, just start at the beginning of this story. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1531.4399999999998s)]
*  What was this tape? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1535.1999999999998s)]
*  When was it shot? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1537.56s)]
*  What does it report? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1538.6399999999999s)]
*  It was shot in 2005. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1539.48s)]
*  It was the end of Access Hollywood was rebuilding a studio. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1542.04s)]
*  So we had to find a reason to get out of the studio. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1545.56s)]
*  So we did Access Across America. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1548.28s)]
*  It started in Miami and it goes to whatever, to Atlanta. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1550.2s)]
*  And then it goes to, it works its way back to Los Angeles, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1555.4s)]
*  giving the studio people enough, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  the workers enough time to finish a new studio. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1563.24s)]
*  So it's just, it was sponsored and the whole thing. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1566.24s)]
*  But the last stop was pick up Donald Trump [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1568.48s)]
*  at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1571.32s)]
*  and drive him 20 minutes to the studio, deliver him, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1574.4s)]
*  because he's gonna make an appearance on Days of Our Lives. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1579.0s)]
*  And he's gonna be playing him, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1582.56s)]
*  he's gonna be playing a big gaudy billionaire [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1584.4s)]
*  who gets hit on by a young starlet. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1588.8s)]
*  That's his character. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1593.64s)]
*  Oh. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1595.24s)]
*  Donald should be able to pull this off. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1596.32s)]
*  So the bus is pulling in and the cameraman, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1598.1599999999999s)]
*  okay, wait, the cameraman, get off the bus. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1602.8799999999999s)]
*  We gotta go down to the end so we can catch your arrival. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1604.8799999999999s)]
*  So the cameraman get off and they run 300 yards ahead [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1607.76s)]
*  while the bus is waiting, stopped waiting to, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1612.32s)]
*  for it's to film its approach. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1615.36s)]
*  Cause the woman who he's gonna be acting with is waiting [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1617.8s)]
*  and there's a welcoming crew from Days of Our Lives [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1620.6399999999999s)]
*  are all waiting and this is the arrival shot. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1623.24s)]
*  So the cameraman gets off, he never stops recording. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1625.6s)]
*  They never. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1629.6399999999999s)]
*  So we're still sitting on the bus with the microphones [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1630.48s)]
*  and he gets off. They never stop recording. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1633.44s)]
*  But it's the red light is still on. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1634.96s)]
*  So the audio is still recording as the cameraman runs away. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1637.56s)]
*  Can't imagine worst luck, right? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1641.56s)]
*  But who cares? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1642.96s)]
*  It's just Donald Trump from The Apprentice. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1643.78s)]
*  And you're just doing this silly little thing. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1646.1599999999999s)]
*  This is 2005 and we're doing this silly arrival shot. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1647.96s)]
*  Well, the Donald at that point, while we're waiting, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1650.8799999999999s)]
*  he gets into his, what he likes to talk about. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1653.24s)]
*  You don't choose the agenda with Donald Trump. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1657.84s)]
*  He talks at you. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1660.36s)]
*  He started by talking about my co-host, Nancy O'Dell. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1665.96s)]
*  And he, she's so hot, what happened? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1674.28s)]
*  I handled that beautifully. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1677.04s)]
*  And he keeps going. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1679.84s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm just too amused. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1680.88s)]
*  He just starts talking and talking and talking. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1683.76s)]
*  And well, everybody knows what he talked about. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1685.08s)]
*  And then when we arrived to the shot, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1687.16s)]
*  except for the end part, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1689.8s)]
*  the most amazing thing about the whole famous line [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1691.28s)]
*  that starts with grab. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1695.52s)]
*  I just can't even say it because it's never funny to me. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1697.52s)]
*  But the amazing part about all that is [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1700.0s)]
*  I have no recollection. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1705.02s)]
*  The first time I ever heard that was 2016. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1706.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1711.0s)]
*  I was amazed before they fired me [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  because I always remembered it for the personal connection, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1713.04s)]
*  him talking about taking Nancy O'Dell furniture shopping. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1716.32s)]
*  And I thought, oh my God, that is so funny. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1721.0s)]
*  Like he took Nancy O'Dell furniture shopping [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1723.28s)]
*  because he was trying to hook up with her. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1725.48s)]
*  And he's like, here, let me, I'll buy you this coffee. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1726.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll buy you an armoire. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1728.8s)]
*  I was like, this is so absurd. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1731.12s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1732.84s)]
*  God, do you think it was true? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1733.6799999999998s)]
*  But here's the amazing thing. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1734.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1736.12s)]
*  I got a hundred percent. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1737.72s)]
*  I got off the bus and oh, so the cameras are there. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1739.8000000000002s)]
*  We returned to filming and I'm like, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1744.88s)]
*  hey, Donald, meet the person you're acting with. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  And the whole thing lines up and looks like [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1749.0s)]
*  I'm feeding a wolf to this, feeding this lovely damsel [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1751.04s)]
*  to this wolf after what has just been said, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1754.96s)]
*  but no one knows what's just been said. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1757.16s)]
*  And I don't even recall hearing the thing. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1758.64s)]
*  I didn't hear that till 11 years later. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1762.0s)]
*  So the whole, it's just a giant shit show. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1763.8200000000002s)]
*  But also you work in LA in the middle of Hollywood. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1766.0800000000002s)]
*  You hear a lot of stuff every day. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1769.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Julia Roberts has said worse to me. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1772.2s)]
*  I mean, not really, but I mean. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1775.0s)]
*  Right, I mean, I know the world [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1776.5600000000002s)]
*  and you were at the center of the world. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1778.1200000000001s)]
*  So everyday people are saying things [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1779.96s)]
*  they wouldn't wanna be on camera. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1782.1200000000001s)]
*  Right, but you also have this, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1783.4s)]
*  we worked in this incredibly weird world [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1785.2s)]
*  where you have like 10, 15 minutes, in my case forever, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1789.28s)]
*  because it was a drive across town, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1793.8000000000002s)]
*  to really talk to someone before you talk to someone. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1796.52s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1799.24s)]
*  You and I chit-chatted for 15 minutes [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1800.08s)]
*  before we turned these microphones on. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1801.68s)]
*  Just like how you doing, what's going on? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1803.54s)]
*  Like how was the drive? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1805.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, but. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1805.88s)]
*  Yeah, but I've known you for a long time. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1806.72s)]
*  But that's, but if you didn't know me, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1807.92s)]
*  you would have that time. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1809.88s)]
*  Always, always. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1811.2s)]
*  To establish a little rapport [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1812.28s)]
*  and you meet them where they are. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1814.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1816.3600000000001s)]
*  So, and with him, you don't have a choice. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1817.2s)]
*  You know, it's never, how's the wife and kids? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1820.72s)]
*  It's never that. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1823.32s)]
*  There's no, what I did the other day, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1824.74s)]
*  great shot over the bunker. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1827.5s)]
*  You can only hope it's a golf day. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1828.8600000000001s)]
*  But then listen, here's the, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1832.54s)]
*  the amazing thing is after that happened, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1834.06s)]
*  like if you wanna look at like, I reported it. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1836.42s)]
*  I didn't report it like, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1839.88s)]
*  he said terrible things on the bus, this is awful. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1840.9s)]
*  I reported it to my, ran upstairs to my boss and I go, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1843.94s)]
*  oh my God, every time with Trump, it's something else. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1846.26s)]
*  The animal, you wouldn't believe what he did. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1850.14s)]
*  He tried to take Nancy Odell furniture shopping [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1852.3799999999999s)]
*  and so he could get laid. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1855.1399999999999s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1856.6599999999999s)]
*  And I'm telling you, you're not gonna believe this. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1858.46s)]
*  The next day, that boss says, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1860.8999999999999s)]
*  oh no, I heard the whole thing, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1863.54s)]
*  what you told me yesterday. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1865.18s)]
*  The guy was rolling. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1866.78s)]
*  I said, he rolled on the tape? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1868.74s)]
*  I said, well, you better do something with that tape. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1870.52s)]
*  And the reason I said that was for nothing that I did, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1874.3s)]
*  nothing that I was ashamed of, I don't care. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1877.3799999999999s)]
*  The reason was, in 2005, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1879.66s)]
*  Donald Trump was the biggest star on NBC, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1882.5400000000002s)]
*  not news, on NBC, making $100 million in profit a year [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1886.3000000000002s)]
*  for the network. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1890.3000000000002s)]
*  Had that tape leaked out in 2005, when it happened, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1891.38s)]
*  heads would have rolled, including mine, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1896.74s)]
*  because you just completely tarnished our major cash cow. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1899.7s)]
*  But can I just ask, I mean, I've been around, you know, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1904.0s)]
*  microphones and cameras my whole life, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1907.82s)]
*  and my understanding to this day is you don't tape people [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1910.02s)]
*  without their knowledge. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1913.18s)]
*  In the state of California, it's, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1914.8999999999999s)]
*  well, this is what's amazing. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1917.3799999999999s)]
*  So 11 years later, NBC News themselves [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1918.42s)]
*  leaks that tape to the Washington Post. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1923.26s)]
*  Of that, there is no doubt. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1925.74s)]
*  They never launched an internal investigation. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1926.82s)]
*  You have a proprietary piece of property [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1928.42s)]
*  that could affect a presidential election, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1930.1s)]
*  and it gets out of your building to someone else. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1932.3s)]
*  You don't launch an investigation. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1935.72s)]
*  How that got out, like you've got to look, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1937.26s)]
*  you've got to find out how that got out. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1939.26s)]
*  Well, it would have ended in five seconds, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1941.4199999999998s)]
*  and it got shoved off to the Washington Post. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1945.06s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is it's unfair to tape people [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1947.26s)]
*  when they don't know they're being taped. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1951.3799999999999s)]
*  It's also illegal. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1953.12s)]
*  In the state of California, if both people don't know, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1953.98s)]
*  it's litigious. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1955.9599999999998s)]
*  That's why they gave it to the Washington Post. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1956.8s)]
*  You got the biggest story of the entire, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  the October surprise of all surprises. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1961.58s)]
*  You've got it in your hands, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1964.1399999999999s)]
*  and you leak it to someone else. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1966.06s)]
*  You're a giant news division. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1967.9s)]
*  This is so many clicks for you. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1969.34s)]
*  This is so much traffic. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1970.68s)]
*  Why wouldn't you own that? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1972.46s)]
*  Well, you can't, because Donald is litigious, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1974.94s)]
*  first of all, and second of all, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1978.68s)]
*  there's enough reason to believe [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1982.5s)]
*  there's no camera on the bus [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1984.18s)]
*  that he didn't know he was being recorded. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1986.06s)]
*  But it's also wrong. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1986.9s)]
*  You shouldn't do that. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1987.86s)]
*  I mean, why is it different putting a camera [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1988.9s)]
*  in somebody's bedroom or the bathroom? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1990.66s)]
*  It is wrong. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1992.42s)]
*  So that's what I fought all week long before I got fired. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1994.14s)]
*  Okay, so, okay, so, but let's get, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1996.94s)]
*  it's actually a more interesting story than I realized. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=1999.46s)]
*  So this happens 2005, now almost 20 years ago. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2001.42s)]
*  You tell your boss, he's seen the tape? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2006.8600000000001s)]
*  He has seen the off, the bus, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2009.14s)]
*  the bus portion of the tape when you talked to him? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2011.66s)]
*  He heard it that one day and told me, I never heard it. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2013.6200000000001s)]
*  He just said, oh yeah, the audio was on. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2016.44s)]
*  He told me, I heard the Nancy stuff. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2018.5400000000002s)]
*  He never mentioned anything about the word grab, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2020.46s)]
*  and never came up. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2023.42s)]
*  Who is your boss? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2024.3400000000001s)]
*  Rob Silverstein. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2025.38s)]
*  Oh yes, oh yes. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2026.5s)]
*  But here's the crazy thing. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2029.38s)]
*  Executive producer of the show. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2030.8600000000001s)]
*  Executive producer of Access Hollywood. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2032.18s)]
*  But we'll get to how he's become the executive producer [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2033.9s)]
*  of my new show once again, how that's come full circle. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2036.5400000000002s)]
*  What? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2039.5400000000002s)]
*  Forgiveness, Tucker, it's an amazingly powerful thing. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2040.38s)]
*  Oh my, you're dying below my mind. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2043.18s)]
*  You ought to try it, you ought to try it. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2044.0200000000002s)]
*  He's working for me. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2045.5800000000002s)]
*  Don't think I didn't kick his teeth in. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2046.42s)]
*  Don't think we didn't fall out for two years. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2048.58s)]
*  Don't think I didn't take back the Rolex [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2050.58s)]
*  I gave him as a gift when I moved from the Pee-Wees [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2052.66s)]
*  to the big leagues when I got my big job at the Today Show. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2056.7799999999997s)]
*  I had a party and I said, here you go baby. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2059.42s)]
*  I'm giving you a Rolex. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2061.6s)]
*  Thanks for helping me get there. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2062.68s)]
*  Two months later I said, you son of a bitch. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2065.02s)]
*  If I ever see you, I'm gonna kill you, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2066.8999999999996s)]
*  and I'm gonna take, give me that fucking, that Rolex back. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2068.3999999999996s)]
*  And now he's your producer again. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2072.46s)]
*  Now he's my producer again, because you know what? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2073.2999999999997s)]
*  We had so many, just sometimes you have, he's, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2075.1s)]
*  I don't blame him because he was looking to, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2078.58s)]
*  he asked for permission when he sent the tape to NBC News, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2082.22s)]
*  he was asking for permission to use it. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2085.58s)]
*  Wait, so, okay, let's just back up here [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2087.8999999999996s)]
*  because I know the story, but others don't. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2090.3399999999997s)]
*  So you, and Rob Silverstein was your friend too, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2093.2999999999997s)]
*  not just a EP. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2096.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2098.2999999999997s)]
*  So. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2099.14s)]
*  Spent the night together sharing a bed [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2099.98s)]
*  during the blackout in New York in like 2012 [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2102.06s)]
*  or whatever it was. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2104.8199999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2105.7799999999997s)]
*  Because we had nowhere to, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2106.62s)]
*  yeah, sweating next to this guy. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2107.8599999999997s)]
*  So that's the last you hear of this tape [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2110.1s)]
*  for 11 years until you get off the air, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2116.42s)]
*  if I'm following this correctly, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2119.1s)]
*  and Matt Lauer comes up to you [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2120.74s)]
*  and you're not thinking about the tape, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2122.38s)]
*  no one ever mentions the tape again, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2123.7s)]
*  the tape is just like faded into the past. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2124.98s)]
*  The day before that Monday, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2126.8199999999997s)]
*  Rob Silverstein called me in New York and he just said, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2128.1s)]
*  hey, just, you know, NBC's asking, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2130.18s)]
*  I mean, remember the tape with Trump and the whole thing, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2131.98s)]
*  they like, they may wanna like look at the, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2134.06s)]
*  they're asking for a transcript, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2136.8199999999997s)]
*  I may send it to him [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2138.22s)]
*  because Trump said some crazy things. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2139.06s)]
*  You don't worry about you, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2140.7799999999997s)]
*  you don't do anything on it, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2141.94s)]
*  you don't even say a thing. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2143.8999999999996s)]
*  I say, okay, whatever, it doesn't mean anything. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2146.18s)]
*  Then the next day, he says, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2149.58s)]
*  I'll call you if anything happens. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2151.66s)]
*  Well, I never got a call from him. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2153.8999999999996s)]
*  The next thing I hear about it is it's in Lack's hands. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2155.02s)]
*  Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News has it [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2158.4199999999996s)]
*  and Kim, whatever her name is, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2161.02s)]
*  the legal counsel, the lawyer, she's on it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2163.06s)]
*  And Lauer says, you should probably go see Andy Lack, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2165.82s)]
*  you know, before this thing, they have it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2170.1000000000004s)]
*  And I was like, oh, oh my God, okay. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2173.7400000000002s)]
*  So I went, left the studio, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2177.2200000000003s)]
*  went across up to Andy Lack's office [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2178.6600000000003s)]
*  and Noah was there and I said, hey, Noah, what's going on? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2180.94s)]
*  He said, yes, we got this tape. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2184.86s)]
*  I said, listen, I've never, I don't know what tape, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2186.7000000000003s)]
*  like I know about the tape, I just, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2189.06s)]
*  but I've never heard it. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2191.6600000000003s)]
*  Like I've, so he played it for me. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2193.14s)]
*  And I will never forget sitting in Noah Oppenheim's office, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2196.5s)]
*  the president, the general manager of the Today Show, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2199.46s)]
*  as he played the part and when it got to the grab line, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2202.02s)]
*  Noah laughed. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2204.74s)]
*  I mean, he was in the room. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2206.14s)]
*  Oh, he laughed. He laughed. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2206.98s)]
*  Oh, and I guess I got fired for laughing, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2208.98s)]
*  but there he is laughing [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2211.1s)]
*  because when you hear something that absurd, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2212.02s)]
*  what do you do? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2215.22s)]
*  You laugh. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2216.2599999999998s)]
*  Mostly laugh, it's like a nervous laugh. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2217.1s)]
*  It's a, you know, I've never heard anyone [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2218.66s)]
*  say what he said. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2222.58s)]
*  I was like, this can't be real, obviously, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2223.46s)]
*  so I'm going to laugh. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2225.18s)]
*  But I don't recall it. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2229.34s)]
*  So it's just the first time I ever heard it was that day. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2230.46s)]
*  And I went, oh dear. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2233.46s)]
*  And then I watched the tape and I saw the arrival [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2234.58s)]
*  and the greeting and I said, oh my God, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2236.9s)]
*  the optics of this are just horrible. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2238.54s)]
*  I'm the first to admit, this looks terrible. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2241.02s)]
*  And what happened in the ensuing days was, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2244.9s)]
*  hey, what do you want to do about this, Billy? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2250.62s)]
*  And I said, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2253.14s)]
*  What do you want to do about it? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2253.98s)]
*  I said, what do I, this crazy, yeah. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2254.82s)]
*  This is from Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2256.26s)]
*  who was the only person in the world I'd hit [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2258.6600000000003s)]
*  with a tire iron if he was sitting right here. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2260.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2262.1800000000003s)]
*  And Noah, I wouldn't, I've forgiven Noah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2263.86s)]
*  Andy, tire iron. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2266.02s)]
*  Truth. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2271.14s)]
*  But in the ensuing days, it was all, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2272.46s)]
*  what do you want to do? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2276.36s)]
*  We could do something with this, you know, these things. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2278.66s)]
*  I remember this quote. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2280.74s)]
*  These things have a way of getting out. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2282.06s)]
*  That's what Noah said to me. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2284.7s)]
*  And I'm like, no, they don't. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2285.7s)]
*  You can't, listen, what if I become the guy [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2286.54s)]
*  who's preamble before interviews gets used, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2290.5s)]
*  that's, whoever that public figure is, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2294.66s)]
*  is never gonna talk to me. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2297.18s)]
*  I'm gonna be the guy that no one wants to talk to [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2298.16s)]
*  because don't talk to Billy Bush before the interview, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2299.94s)]
*  the cameras are rolling [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2302.54s)]
*  because he's probably secretly rolling. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2303.5s)]
*  It's journalism 101. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2305.62s)]
*  And no one came to my defense on it, of course, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2307.42s)]
*  because they're all, it was such a hot time. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2309.58s)]
*  Everybody was just, you know, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2312.14s)]
*  their heads were in the sand. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2314.2999999999997s)]
*  But that whole week was what do you want to do? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2316.14s)]
*  And I said, you can't use this. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2320.18s)]
*  It's illegal to do that to him, to anyone. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2321.72s)]
*  I wasn't defending Trump. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm defending my reputation as a journalist [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2326.38s)]
*  and someone who wants to interview [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2329.18s)]
*  other people in the future. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2330.5s)]
*  And just basic fairness. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2331.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2333.42s)]
*  And also, by the way, you were paid to interview Trump [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2334.5s)]
*  and to do this set piece within the scene with him. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2337.58s)]
*  That was your job. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2341.34s)]
*  Like you didn't, it's not like you and Trump [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2342.3s)]
*  were like in a bar or something. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2344.26s)]
*  It was like this, you were working for the same company. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2345.66s)]
*  He was a primary job for me then. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2348.58s)]
*  Remember, The Apprentice was the biggest thing on TV [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2350.58s)]
*  and Trump, every other celebrity had a publicist [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2353.46s)]
*  that followed them around and said, you can't say this, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2355.94s)]
*  you can't do that, you can't use this. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2357.92s)]
*  You know, they try to shape your message. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2360.26s)]
*  Trump's publicist literally just carried like a bag for him [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2362.7s)]
*  because Trump is gonna do what Trump's gonna wanna do. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2366.4199999999996s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2369.54s)]
*  So he was a soundbite machine. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2370.7s)]
*  I was with him three days a week. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2372.8599999999997s)]
*  And when I wasn't with him, my boss would say, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  how do you get the next thing with Trump? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2378.4199999999996s)]
*  We gotta, Trump's, we need him for, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2379.66s)]
*  we need him every day if we can have him. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2382.54s)]
*  Cause he's saying things like, remember how, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2385.22s)]
*  the horrible stuff he said about Rosie? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2386.8199999999997s)]
*  But every entertainment show couldn't wait [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2389.4399999999996s)]
*  to run that as a headline. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2391.86s)]
*  Of course. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2392.98s)]
*  Right, no one does this. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2393.82s)]
*  Amazing. Except Trump. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2395.94s)]
*  How is he? He's gold for ratings. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2397.34s)]
*  He's unbelievable. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2399.1400000000003s)]
*  In fact, he's helped me. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2401.3s)]
*  So I was constantly tasked with, get on his plane, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2402.1400000000003s)]
*  get into his apartment, go on a house tour with him. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2405.3s)]
*  One of the great things I did with Donald Trump, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2409.1s)]
*  still available online, check it out. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2410.86s)]
*  We went voting together in 2004, Bush-Carrie. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2413.28s)]
*  We went voting together and it was, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2417.7000000000003s)]
*  we went to four different polling places [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2419.7400000000002s)]
*  and he wasn't registered in any of them. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2422.6600000000003s)]
*  It was hysterical and he kept getting furious. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2423.6000000000004s)]
*  So I just did all these things and- [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2428.32s)]
*  Did you have fun? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2430.5600000000004s)]
*  It was part of my job. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2431.4s)]
*  Like I got promoted, I ultimately became the host [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2432.2400000000002s)]
*  of the show because of the amazing things I did [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2434.1600000000003s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2436.6800000000003s)]
*  I dressed up in, in disguise and snuck into the season [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2437.6800000000003s)]
*  two auditions of, of the apprentice. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2443.0s)]
*  And I auditioned as a mustache and I had a cowboy hat on. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2446.5600000000004s)]
*  I called myself Richard Broom. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2449.48s)]
*  And I made my way over to a table and Donald was sitting [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2452.28s)]
*  at the table and I sat down with eight other strangers. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2454.52s)]
*  And as he asked questions of everybody, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2457.84s)]
*  see if they'd be a part of the cast. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2460.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2461.68s)]
*  And he looks at me and he goes, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2462.52s)]
*  you're a weird looking fellow. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2463.34s)]
*  He's take off your hat and took it off. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2464.72s)]
*  He goes, if I don't know that's Billy Bush, I don't know. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2468.8s)]
*  We had a huge laugh. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2471.04s)]
*  I mean, let me tell you something. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2472.2s)]
*  Donald Trump was the greatest reality television host ever. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2474.16s)]

*  you know what, why don't we instead of doing 15 minutes [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2487.3999999999996s)]
*  of the boardroom at the end, let's do 15 minutes [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2489.8399999999997s)]
*  of stupid lemonade sales and then 55 minutes [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2492.6s)]
*  or 45 minutes of the boardroom at the end. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2495.52s)]
*  Cause that's what people really want to see. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2498.9199999999996s)]

*  you look like a nice person. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2509.0s)]

*  It was five years ago this month that people started [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2517.3s)]
*  to drop dead in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2519.8s)]
*  Five years since the beginning of COVID, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2523.12s)]
*  tens of millions dead, societies reordered completely, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2525.32s)]

*  to the most basic questions. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2533.8s)]
*  Where did this virus come from? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2535.12s)]
*  How did it get here? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2536.56s)]
*  Why did the government tell us to do things [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2538.0s)]
*  they knew wouldn't work? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2539.92s)]
*  None of those questions have been adequately answered. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2541.28s)]
*  And one man knows those answers. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2543.52s)]
*  His name is Dr. Tony Fauci. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2545.44s)]

*  he went through tens of thousands of pages of documents [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2564.84s)]
*  and pieced together the story, which is shocking. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2568.0800000000004s)]

*  My brother is a great healthcare executive. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2596.72s)]
*  He built a company called Athena Health. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2599.56s)]
*  The chairman of his board at one point became Jeff Immelt, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2601.96s)]
*  who became the chairman of my brother's board. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2608.06s)]
*  My brother reported to him. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2610.32s)]
*  From GE. As the CEO, yeah. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2611.8s)]
*  From GE, and GE owned NBC long before, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2613.44s)]
*  when The Apprentice was just coming on. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2617.96s)]
*  And Donald wanted his contract renegotiated, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2620.54s)]
*  and he demand, forget Jeff Zucker and the NBC people. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2622.7799999999997s)]
*  I want Immelt to do this with me. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2626.38s)]
*  I want the CEO of GE to do my second year deal. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2628.2599999999998s)]
*  And Immelt told my brother, he's like, you know, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2633.42s)]
*  if there were cameras at that lunch, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2636.42s)]
*  or a little hidden microphone at that lunch, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2638.7s)]
*  I guess I would have been fired, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2640.82s)]
*  because you just go with what Trump wants to go with. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2642.38s)]
*  Yeah, and they were similar. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2644.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know what I mean? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2648.84s)]
*  Because here's one thing about Trump. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2650.2200000000003s)]
*  He is, his loyalty isn't long. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2651.38s)]
*  If you, like, if I were to say to him, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2655.2200000000003s)]
*  hey, how dare you talk like that? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2656.94s)]
*  Like, I'm not gonna be on this bus. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2658.78s)]
*  You shouldn't say such terrible things. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2660.46s)]
*  I will, I'm leaving. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2662.26s)]
*  And I took a moral stand and walked out, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2663.7400000000002s)]
*  or whatever I did. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2665.38s)]
*  Get rid of Billy Bush, we don't like him. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2667.2200000000003s)]
*  We're doing entertainment tonight only now. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2668.54s)]
*  That's it. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2670.26s)]
*  And then you're done. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2671.1s)]
*  So literally my job, hired to, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2672.42s)]
*  was to make sure we had him as often as possible, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2674.86s)]
*  and get great sound bites and kick ass. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2677.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you ever hear any NBC executives complain about him? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2680.58s)]
*  Or his politics? No. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2683.18s)]
*  No, but I do know that, look, he was placated [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2684.5s)]
*  as every big star of every big show in the business is, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2687.9399999999996s)]
*  all the way up to the ivory tower, 100%, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2691.7799999999997s)]
*  from Jeff Zucker to Jeff Immelt. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2695.7999999999997s)]
*  The whole, you know, here's a beautiful irony. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2698.5s)]
*  Jeff Zucker, who I like, was running the show [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2701.22s)]
*  at NBC Entertainment. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2705.74s)]
*  He's the one who put, he built this, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2707.2599999999998s)]
*  if Trump is Frankenstein, he built him in the laboratory. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2709.8999999999996s)]
*  And they built this apprentice, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2713.3799999999997s)]
*  and they made him the wheeling and dealing machine [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2714.58s)]
*  on his helicopter, this incredible image. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2717.4599999999996s)]
*  Can you imagine a better image on network television [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2719.74s)]
*  crafted for you than that one? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2723.14s)]
*  And Zucker then became, years later, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2725.72s)]
*  the head of the resistance. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2730.8599999999997s)]
*  The guy that built him then became [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2732.2799999999997s)]
*  the head of the resistance at CNN. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2734.14s)]
*  It's amazing. It's amazing. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2735.4599999999996s)]
*  It's amazing in a matter of 10 years. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2736.42s)]
*  Like this recording of this bus tape, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2738.86s)]
*  that was a, I would have been fired, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2740.98s)]
*  it had leaked out then for hurting the star. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2743.46s)]
*  11 years later, and a lawsuit over Miss Universe [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2746.94s)]
*  and whatever else, NBC feels completely differently [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2749.78s)]
*  about Donald Trump, and now it's get him at all costs. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2752.26s)]
*  Get him out of this presidential race at all costs. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2756.38s)]
*  I don't care who we have to kill [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2759.42s)]
*  or shooting ahead on the way, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2761.0s)]
*  including Billy Bush, no problem. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2762.58s)]
*  Get rid of him. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2766.98s)]
*  So that's... [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2767.82s)]
*  It's an incredible... [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2768.64s)]
*  There was so much going on during that period [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2771.1s)]
*  that it, of course, the tape and that one phrase [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2773.66s)]
*  still kind of hangs in the air, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2777.14s)]
*  but the actual story never really got told. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2778.78s)]
*  There was too much chaos going on. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2782.82s)]
*  No, it's never been told. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2784.2200000000003s)]
*  It was like the opening salvas of a war, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2785.06s)]
*  and like an atrocity was left unexamined. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2787.1s)]
*  No, and look, I was a sitting duck, right? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2789.42s)]
*  It was a hot time. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2791.54s)]
*  People were feeling really strongly, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2792.62s)]
*  as they still are. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2796.44s)]
*  Trump is... [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2797.32s)]
*  It's like country music. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2799.2799999999997s)]
*  Love him or hate him, right? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2800.2s)]
*  I mean... [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2801.24s)]
*  So what was that? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2802.06s)]
*  Did you... [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2802.96s)]
*  Okay, so you move over, and that just to be... [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2803.8s)]
*  I just wanna say this for the third time. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2806.48s)]
*  That tape after you spoke to Rob about it, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2807.92s)]
*  to your EP about it, the next day, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2812.8s)]
*  was never mentioned again for 11 years. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2815.44s)]
*  No, never mentioned again. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2819.6s)]
*  No, intermittently over the years, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2821.2s)]
*  you'd be like, God, that reminds me of... [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2823.64s)]
*  Trump told me about that, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2826.2s)]
*  but it was always about Nancy O'Dell, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2827.2s)]
*  maybe every three years or something. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2828.88s)]
*  Maybe five times total between 2005 and 2016. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2831.48s)]
*  The Nancy O'Dell part's been lost in history. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2835.96s)]
*  But always as a reference, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  because Trump said something that reminded me [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2837.7599999999998s)]
*  of the whole thing. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2839.7999999999997s)]
*  Was Trump political, by the way? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2842.2s)]
*  Was he regarded as political [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2843.7999999999997s)]
*  when he was the host of The Apprentice? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2845.24s)]
*  No, God no, no. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2846.72s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2849.72s)]
*  The idea that this... [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2850.56s)]
*  If you wanna talk about just bad luck in general, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2851.64s)]
*  the idea that Donald Trump in 2005 [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2853.6s)]
*  would one day run for president, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2855.96s)]
*  and he's talked about it forever, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2857.32s)]
*  but he would do it to just mix things up. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2858.84s)]
*  He called me right before he announced [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2863.12s)]
*  and said I'm gonna announce, and I laughed. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2865.48s)]
*  Because I'd known him all these years, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2867.68s)]
*  and I thought of Trump as a person [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2868.88s)]
*  who was not serious about politics, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2872.52s)]
*  who was gonna use it to sell a book [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2873.84s)]
*  or promote a show or whatever. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2875.2799999999997s)]
*  Or reboot the image after The Apprentice [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2877.12s)]
*  had run its course. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2879.36s)]
*  It was very successful. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2880.2s)]
*  So I literally laughed at him when he called me. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2881.04s)]
*  I was in the car, I'll never forget it. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2883.9199999999996s)]
*  And he was totally calm, and he said, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2885.04s)]
*  yep, I see what you're saying, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2886.52s)]
*  but I think this time I'm gonna surprise you. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2887.7999999999997s)]
*  And he sounded totally different. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2890.3999999999996s)]
*  But I agree with you, you knew him much better than I did. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2891.8799999999997s)]
*  When he came down the escalator, I said, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2893.72s)]
*  oh my God, this is gonna be unbelievable. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2895.52s)]
*  This is gonna, he's having so much fun. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2897.7999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2900.72s)]
*  This is a joke. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2901.56s)]
*  He's having fun, and all of a sudden, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2902.3999999999996s)]
*  everything he said that people didn't like, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2904.9599999999996s)]
*  he got more popular, and he's like, what? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2909.24s)]
*  I don't think he was surprised more than anyone. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2911.6s)]
*  Like, wait a minute, they like me more? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2914.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2917.4s)]
*  And he just steamrolled everybody. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2918.92s)]
*  So, wow, man, it's also amazing in retrospect. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2920.84s)]
*  But did he, and all the time you spent with him, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2925.2s)]
*  did he ever say anything you thought was political at all? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2929.2s)]
*  No. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2931.56s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2932.4s)]
*  Never. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2933.22s)]
*  No, it was not a chance. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2934.32s)]
*  We went voting in 2000. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2938.56s)]
*  Four, the beginning of The Apprentice. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2941.96s)]
*  And I remember him laughing. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2944.68s)]
*  I said, have you endorsed one of the, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2949.72s)]
*  I mean, have you given money to one of the candidates? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2952.0s)]
*  Are you behind one of them? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2954.52s)]
*  He goes, I am. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2955.48s)]
*  I said, to which one? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2957.88s)]
*  He goes, I can't, I said, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2958.7599999999998s)]
*  is there a chance that it's both of them? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2960.2799999999997s)]
*  And he said, there is. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2962.4s)]
*  Like, he had given money to both guys. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2964.12s)]
*  You're my guy, here's a check. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2966.36s)]
*  You're my guy, here's a check. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2968.04s)]
*  Remember, Trump was open about that back in the day. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2969.6s)]
*  He was like, look, I needed to build, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2971.72s)]
*  I wanted my businesses to thrive. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2973.04s)]
*  So I played nice with everybody on both sides. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2975.16s)]
*  Remember his wedding in 2005 with Melania. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2977.48s)]
*  There's Bill and Hillary Clinton, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2980.52s)]
*  and everyone's there kissing the ring. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2981.92s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2985.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2986.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, so you go up to Andy Lack's office, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2987.72s)]
*  Noah Oppenheim is sitting there, you screen the tape, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2990.72s)]
*  and they say to you, Billy, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2993.74s)]
*  what do you wanna do about this? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2995.16s)]
*  Yeah, what do you wanna do about this? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2996.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, do you wanna get out of front? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2997.68s)]
*  That's your problem. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2998.56s)]
*  I mean, I could have done what the little minion [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=2999.64s)]
*  who wants to save his butt, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3004.32s)]
*  and I might've if I had been, if I wasn't so stupid, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3006.56s)]
*  I didn't get what they were saying. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3010.28s)]
*  In other words, they're saying, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3012.16s)]
*  do you wanna get out in front of it? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3013.0s)]
*  What if I had taken that tape, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3014.48s)]
*  and the most disingenuous little save my own ass move, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3017.08s)]
*  I get on the air and I say, okay, look, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3021.44s)]
*  yeah, I know this was recorded before the interview, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3024.6s)]
*  and it was off camera. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3027.2s)]
*  It's an off mic thing and the whole thing, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3029.04s)]
*  and don't read into how bad that is [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3030.7599999999998s)]
*  as a journalist to be doing this, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3033.04s)]
*  but because this is such a serious election, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3034.3599999999997s)]
*  and in the interest of all information and candor, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3038.3599999999997s)]
*  I wanna present this, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3042.8799999999997s)]
*  and I want you, the American people, to hear this, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3044.12s)]
*  because you're about to vote [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3046.2s)]
*  on the President of the United States. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3047.8399999999997s)]
*  You should know this, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3049.2799999999997s)]
*  and so it's just, these are extenuating circumstances, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3050.68s)]
*  and here I go, and I don't look good on this tape, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3053.7599999999998s)]
*  because I have to do this greeting at the end, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3056.16s)]
*  and it looks bad, but I really, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3058.48s)]
*  it's important to me to do this, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3062.04s)]
*  and then I put it out there for people. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3062.92s)]
*  I might have been the, wow, Billy Bush is courageous, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3065.48s)]
*  by the media establishment. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3068.16s)]
*  What a courageous guy, he had to do that, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3070.64s)]
*  we'll give him a pass, because look, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3072.52s)]
*  he brought forward this beautiful thing [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3074.56s)]
*  that will take out the enemy. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3077.12s)]
*  Because he's screwing Trump. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3077.96s)]
*  Because he's screwing Trump, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3079.04s)]
*  and in the end, this is the very beginning [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3080.3599999999997s)]
*  of Trump Derangement Syndrome, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3082.48s)]
*  no matter what, screwing Trump [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3084.44s)]
*  is paramount above everything else. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3086.8s)]
*  So I would have gotten the pass from the media, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3089.7200000000003s)]
*  and maybe still take a little vacation, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3092.8s)]
*  but be back still at the Today Show, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3095.52s)]
*  making lots and lots of money for, you know. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3097.1600000000003s)]
*  But I said, no, no, it's wrong. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3100.7200000000003s)]
*  I can't have people look at me that I've got to be, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3103.96s)]
*  I'm not the guy that's doing that, to anyone. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3107.6800000000003s)]
*  I know the stakes, and I know how you want this election [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3111.0s)]
*  to turn out, I know how you want it to turn out, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3114.44s)]
*  but I can't do that, I wouldn't do it to anyone. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3116.32s)]
*  And they said, okay, we understand. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3119.7200000000003s)]
*  And then they tried to get Access Hollywood, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3124.08s)]
*  okay, why don't you guys do a little version of this [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3126.0s)]
*  and put it on? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3128.14s)]
*  And then I made a huge mistake, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3129.6s)]
*  and I said to my executive producer, I said, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3131.16s)]
*  Trump didn't know that this was on, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3134.92s)]
*  any other guest would know, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3136.56s)]
*  I have no protectionism of Trump, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3137.6s)]
*  I don't, you know, whatever, it's just wrong. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3139.2400000000002s)]
*  And they're setting you up, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3144.6800000000003s)]
*  you're gonna become the fall guy, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3145.52s)]
*  Trump's gonna sue NBC for putting this thing out there, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3146.4s)]
*  because he didn't know he was being recorded, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3149.88s)]
*  and you're the fall guy, you dummy, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3151.44s)]
*  and they're gonna fire you. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3153.52s)]
*  And he went, oh my God, you're right. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3155.04s)]
*  So he called back Andy Lack, and he said, no, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3156.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm not putting it on Access Hollywood tonight. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3159.2000000000003s)]
*  That was a Friday night. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3161.6400000000003s)]
*  No, Thursday night. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3164.0600000000004s)]
*  Remember, that Sunday, the ninth, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3166.32s)]
*  was the second presidential debate [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3168.92s)]
*  between Hillary Clinton. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3170.8s)]
*  They needed this out there before the debate, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3172.52s)]
*  so Anderson Cooper's first question could be [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3174.88s)]
*  about sexual assault and Donald Trump perpetrating it. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3179.56s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3182.56s)]
*  So, wait, hold on, a little background context. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3183.8s)]
*  You said this was the beginning of Trump Derangement Syndrome. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3187.12s)]
*  Did you sense that at NBC? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3189.48s)]
*  Oh God, absolutely. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3191.08s)]
*  I mean, anything. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3193.04s)]
*  Remember this, over at ABC News, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3195.0s)]
*  at the same time when Trump became president, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3197.7599999999998s)]
*  they launched a 70, they built a 75 person [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3200.56s)]
*  investigative unit, I know the guy who was head of it, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3204.7999999999997s)]
*  dedicated to anything negative on Trump. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3208.68s)]
*  Find stuff on him and get him out. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3211.96s)]
*  This is not journalism, this is not news, it is activism. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3215.08s)]
*  When you're calling journalism, it's total activism. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3220.92s)]
*  So that's all the major networks. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3225.36s)]
*  That's why, by the way, when NBC does the shitty thing [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3227.6s)]
*  that they did, ABC and CBS don't call it out. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3230.9199999999996s)]
*  They don't say, hey, you're competing with each other. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3233.16s)]
*  I would want to pound my competitor. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3237.04s)]
*  Look what you did, that was dirty, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3238.8799999999997s)]
*  because all of them would have done it too, probably. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3240.8799999999997s)]
*  They all shared that mission. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3243.2s)]
*  I mean, even at the channel I worked at, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3244.8399999999997s)]
*  which was the one conservative channel, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3250.3199999999997s)]
*  a lot of people hated Trump, really, really hated Trump. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3252.2s)]
*  But you were in such an interesting spot [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3255.64s)]
*  because you knew him so well for so many years [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3257.32s)]
*  in a totally different. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3260.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I hosted eight pageants for him all over the world. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3261.56s)]
*  I went with Donald to Ecuador, to Bangkok, to Panama, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3265.4s)]
*  as we take back the canal. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3270.92s)]
*  I was with him all the time. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3274.44s)]
*  I flew on his plane and hosted the Paley Center panel [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3275.6800000000003s)]
*  on this incredible phenomenon, The Apprentice. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3280.0s)]
*  And Donald said, you can fly with me, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3282.0s)]
*  and if we flew on the plane, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3284.0800000000004s)]
*  I'd never seen Donald without a tie on it. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3285.2000000000003s)]
*  I was this tight, rolled up sleeves, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3287.84s)]
*  buttoned the white shirt unbuttoned, no tie, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3289.52s)]
*  it was incredible. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3292.68s)]
*  Never have I seen that. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3293.52s)]
*  I didn't know what to make of it. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3296.24s)]
*  I was like, he's so relaxed, this is weird. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3297.08s)]
*  But he hung out and we told stories. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3300.7599999999998s)]
*  I had spent more time with him, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3302.92s)]
*  I still think I've spent more time with him [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3304.7999999999997s)]
*  on camera than anyone. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3307.24s)]
*  I bet that's right. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3308.88s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3309.72s)]
*  And I've spent a lot of time with Trump, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3310.84s)]
*  and I'll just say I've enjoyed pretty much all of it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3312.68s)]
*  Wildly entertaining. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3316.9199999999996s)]
*  Wildly. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3318.08s)]
*  Wildly entertaining, and I have to tell you, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3318.9199999999996s)]
*  one of the funniest people I have ever, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3320.7999999999997s)]
*  the laughter that I, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3324.16s)]
*  splitting my sides laughing at the things he would say. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3326.48s)]
*  And some of it's because he's almost like a caricature, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3329.3199999999997s)]
*  the third person speak and all that. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3332.9199999999996s)]
*  It's wildly funny. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3335.0s)]
*  So you don't really take much of it seriously. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3336.12s)]
*  When he said what he said at the end of the tape there, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3340.6s)]
*  I never for one second thought that that was a serious thing. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3343.84s)]
*  I mean, who would say that? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3349.6800000000003s)]
*  And I just, but you just laugh. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3351.48s)]
*  Yeah, the funniest, I agree, the funniest. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3354.44s)]
*  The funniest. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3356.88s)]
*  I once took someone, I went to dinner with him, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3358.6000000000004s)]
*  and I brought someone who was, you know, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3360.2400000000002s)]
*  politically on his side, I think, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3362.76s)]
*  but was like, really Donald Trump? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3364.84s)]
*  And at the end of the meal, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3366.28s)]
*  this break out in the car with the person, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3367.7200000000003s)]
*  he goes, that's the greatest dinner I've ever had. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3369.08s)]
*  I've never had a dinner like that in my life. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3371.2400000000002s)]
*  Anyway, but so given the fact, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3374.52s)]
*  I think you actually have spent way more time on camera [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3378.52s)]
*  than anyone in the world with Donald Trump. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3380.76s)]
*  So it just puts you, but again, as you've said, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3383.0s)]
*  not in any kind of political context. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3386.1200000000003s)]
*  So now you're working on the Today Show, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3388.7200000000003s)]
*  biggest, biggest news show in the country. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3391.6400000000003s)]
*  And they put out an APB to all properties. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3393.76s)]
*  Find us something that show, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3397.28s)]
*  cause a woman who was a Miss Universe contestant, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3400.4s)]
*  this is early end of September, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3402.96s)]
*  had come forward and said, he was disparaging towards me. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3405.68s)]
*  And Trump said, I've never been disparaging [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3409.44s)]
*  towards a woman in my life. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3411.52s)]
*  I've never done anything like that. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3412.7200000000003s)]
*  So then NBC said, okay, find something of, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3413.84s)]
*  look at all your tapes, everybody, every division [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3418.7200000000003s)]
*  of anything he might've said, disparaging about a woman [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3421.56s)]
*  so we can prove him wrong, ha, we gotcha. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3424.08s)]
*  And then Rob Silverstein, my executive producer, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3427.64s)]
*  it was like, oh, wait a minute. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3430.2400000000002s)]
*  That tape that's collecting dust in my thing, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3432.28s)]
*  he said something about Nancy O'Dell that was disparaging. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3434.7200000000003s)]
*  Remember, this has always been about Nancy O'Dell. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3437.56s)]
*  And so he takes the tape out and he's like, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3440.04s)]
*  then he calls NBC to say, hey, I may have something, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3442.88s)]
*  I could use it, I'm not sure I need your legal approval [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3446.52s)]
*  because although a very small division, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3450.56s)]
*  it's a division of NBC News, Access Hollywood. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3453.88s)]
*  So I need legal permission here. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3457.36s)]
*  I don't wanna go out there [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3459.48s)]
*  because I don't think he knows he's being recorded. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3460.4s)]
*  I need a blessing. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3462.0s)]
*  And then they sent it and from there they said, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3463.44s)]
*  okay, we'll take it from here, thank you so much. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3465.28s)]
*  What do you think that was, why? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3467.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's just so, especially strange for NBC, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3468.44s)]
*  which as you've said a couple of times, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3471.1200000000003s)]
*  was the recipient of like all this profit, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3473.28s)]
*  $100 million a year from this show. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3476.6800000000003s)]
*  So like they love Trump, but they pivot so fast [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3479.2400000000002s)]
*  to hating Trump obsessively, why? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3482.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, 11 years, a lot can happen, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3485.56s)]
*  like the bitter negotiations over the Miss Universe pageant [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3487.44s)]
*  and the fallout and lawsuits and counter suits. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3491.2000000000003s)]
*  And after he left The Apprentice, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3493.7200000000003s)]
*  they replaced him at one point with, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3498.28s)]
*  they tried to replace him with Arnold Schwarzenegger [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3501.56s)]
*  and he denigrated them. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3504.4s)]
*  Schwarzenegger's terrible, those two hated each other. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3507.12s)]
*  They fought. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3509.08s)]
*  Trump's a street thief, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3512.1600000000003s)]
*  he's the king of the concrete jungle. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3513.1600000000003s)]
*  And so he's like, once The Apprentice had died, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3515.64s)]
*  he blamed them for it and he fights dirty. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3518.56s)]
*  And they, and I think they had that big lawsuit [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3522.4s)]
*  over Miss Universe kind of bummed them out [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3526.7599999999998s)]
*  and they ended up hating each other, it happens. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3530.0s)]
*  And so a falling out. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3537.08s)]
*  And then when he decides to run later, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3539.48s)]
*  now it's like get him at all costs. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3541.44s)]
*  And they want Hillary. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3544.04s)]
*  They just, that's their preferred. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3547.52s)]
*  Yeah, they want Hillary, but you didn't see that. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3549.36s)]
*  But with such vitriol for Trump. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3552.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3554.2s)]
*  And it wasn't just NBC, it was everybody. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3555.24s)]
*  But it was everybody. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3557.04s)]
*  Like what, but looking back eight years later, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3557.88s)]
*  any idea why? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3560.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not like Trump is super right wing or anything. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3561.4s)]
*  Well, back in the day, look, I'm gonna confess myself. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3563.7599999999998s)]
*  I said, listen, I spent a lot of time with Trump. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3565.84s)]
*  He'd be a terrible president. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3567.6s)]
*  This is a crazy idea. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3568.8s)]
*  And I said that on the air in 2015, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3571.28s)]
*  on my live daytime show, I said, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3575.64s)]
*  as a man who has spent probably the most amount of time, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3578.4s)]
*  this is a terrible idea. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3580.84s)]
*  Now, to be clear, I'm the nephew of George H.W. Bush. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3583.04s)]
*  He was a real steward and by the book sort of guy [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3588.6s)]
*  and felt, he was a character first, all these things. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3593.6s)]
*  Trump was something we had never seen before. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3598.4s)]
*  But also he was, since he brought it up, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3599.76s)]
*  he was running against your cousin. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3601.7200000000003s)]
*  And he's running against Jeb, low energy Jeb, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3603.48s)]
*  is what he called him. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3606.0800000000004s)]
*  So this puts you in like the weirdest position [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3606.92s)]
*  of anybody in the media. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3608.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3610.5200000000004s)]
*  When he started saying the low energy thing, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3612.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like, oh man, really, Donald, Jesus. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3613.84s)]
*  You're so brutal, but God, that works, doesn't it? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3617.1200000000003s)]
*  What people misjudged was they were sick of everything [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3621.5200000000004s)]
*  that the way things had been done. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3626.88s)]
*  He knew that and that's why Trump is smart, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3629.56s)]
*  just because he knows where people are [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3632.44s)]
*  and he met them there. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3635.64s)]
*  So, genius in that regard. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3637.2s)]
*  Amazing, amazing story. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3644.4s)]
*  I hadn't really, this whole time we were having [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3646.08s)]
*  the conversation and I sort of forgot that he was running. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3647.92s)]
*  It's so much, there's so many crazy, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3649.92s)]
*  unbelievable details, right? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3652.16s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think it's been handled. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3654.04s)]
*  I think it's like they have had a moment [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3658.56s)]
*  with their conscience and realized you can't do this. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3661.96s)]
*  This is a part of the recording, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3666.0s)]
*  nobody knew it was being recorded. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3667.24s)]
*  You can't do that to someone, you can't do it to me [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3668.68s)]
*  as a journalist to out somebody like that [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3670.48s)]
*  and you can't do it to someone like Donald [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3674.16s)]
*  who's going to sue you, so it's dead. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3676.6s)]
*  Okay, and as soon as Access Hollywood said, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3678.88s)]
*  they're not doing it either, we're not touching this. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3681.88s)]
*  NBC didn't wanna touch it. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3684.52s)]
*  They knew that Trump would sue them. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3687.04s)]
*  They slid it to the Washington Post. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3689.52s)]
*  How'd they do that? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3691.24s)]
*  I'm on a plane. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3692.08s)]
*  I'm on a plane that Friday, two days before the debate, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3694.08s)]
*  I'm going home to Los Angeles to see my family [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3698.0s)]
*  and right before the wheels go up, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3700.7599999999998s)]
*  might look at my phone one last time and bang, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3703.0s)]
*  there's the story on the Washington Post [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3706.0s)]
*  and I go, oh my God, and the next week [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3707.68s)]
*  is the most chaotic week of my entire life. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3710.72s)]
*  Did you have cell phones on the plane? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3712.36s)]
*  I got Wi-Fi 15 minutes later [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3714.48s)]
*  and I had a million messages from Noah. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3716.84s)]
*  You're gonna be fine, you're okay, don't worry, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3718.96s)]
*  we'll take care of you. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3720.56s)]
*  Head of Communications at NBC, don't worry, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3721.88s)]
*  you didn't do anything. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3723.88s)]
*  You did nothing, we've got you, don't worry, we've got you. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3725.0s)]
*  Security will be waiting for you at LAX, we have a car, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3728.96s)]
*  a security guy will take you to the car, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3731.96s)]
*  car will take you home, don't worry, we've got you, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3733.56s)]
*  we've got you, next day, we've got you, we've got you. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3736.16s)]
*  Got me to the point. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3738.76s)]
*  Did your wife text you on the plane? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3739.6s)]
*  My wife texted me and we had a dinner [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3742.0s)]
*  at our friend's house that night and they're like, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3745.04s)]
*  hey, are we still on? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3746.36s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, of course, what do you mean we're on? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3747.36s)]
*  They're like, this is sort of big, I think, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3749.04s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of huge, it's kind of everywhere [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3751.56s)]
*  and I'm like, no, no, they got me. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3753.6s)]
*  We're good, they got me. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3755.0s)]
*  Because they didn't do anything, they got me. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3756.48s)]
*  We land, TMZ, paparazzi, I get home. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3758.76s)]
*  The next day I buy $5,000 worth of new suits [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3762.84s)]
*  because as much as they pay you on the Today Show, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3766.36s)]
*  they don't buy your clothing. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3768.92s)]
*  And I'm like, I gotta get some new suits. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3770.32s)]
*  I mean, I got a fancy new job, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3771.96s)]
*  I'm an important little guy, this is great. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3773.88s)]
*  I buy a bunch of suits, I have someone tailoring them [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3775.96s)]
*  in my living room, I'm doing all this. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3778.2000000000003s)]
*  The next day, Sunday, I go out and there's a car [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3780.6000000000004s)]
*  and driver in the driveway. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3783.6400000000003s)]
*  And as I'm about to open the door with my bags, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3786.28s)]
*  the driver says, hey, they just canceled the car. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3788.44s)]
*  I say, what? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3792.6000000000004s)]
*  It's gotta be a mistake, what are you talking about? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3793.44s)]
*  No, they canceled the car. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3795.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, oh God, I called my lawyer [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3798.1600000000003s)]
*  and I said, what's going on? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3800.68s)]
*  And he says, yeah, they wanna suspend you tomorrow. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3801.52s)]
*  I said, I need to be able to talk tomorrow, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3803.04s)]
*  I need to be able to say something. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3805.2s)]
*  Can't suspend me, he's like, they're suspending you tomorrow. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3806.32s)]
*  And then from there, just this shit unfolded. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3809.4s)]
*  I think I did call you on Saturday [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3813.16s)]
*  and said they're gonna try and screw you. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3814.68s)]
*  I think you did. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3816.48s)]
*  As a man who knows what it looks like when it's coming. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3818.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, I can't resist, I said. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3820.6s)]
*  Hey buddy, you're fucked. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3823.84s)]
*  Yeah, I did say, I said they're gonna try and fuck you. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3825.96s)]
*  And you're like, no, no, no, I've been here a while. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3828.44s)]
*  I've worked for this company. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3830.28s)]
*  No, no, they love me. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3831.1s)]
*  This is the network that raised me. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3831.94s)]
*  No, no, no, they couldn't do that to me. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3833.52s)]
*  I didn't do anything, I'm sorry. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3835.04s)]
*  So my advice, I'll never forget it was, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3835.88s)]
*  because I still think it's good advice, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3838.2000000000003s)]
*  march into Andy Lack's office and say, listen bitch, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3839.92s)]
*  can I call you bitch? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3844.04s)]
*  You may have some thought about destroying me [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3845.52s)]
*  and I'm father of children, so you can't do that. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3848.2000000000003s)]
*  I just didn't see it. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3850.4s)]
*  But if you do that, I will go on Good Morning America [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3851.52s)]
*  on Monday and we're gonna talk [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3855.2000000000003s)]
*  about your marital infidelity. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3856.68s)]

*  No, no, no, because you're not allowed to destroy me. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3859.96s)]
*  So how about don't do that? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3862.3199999999997s)]
*  All your sexual harassment claims [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3864.52s)]

*  just having spent both of us a lot of time in this business. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3957.22s)]
*  The television executives are that rare group, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3960.48s)]
*  and you don't run into them very often, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3962.9s)]
*  who don't respond to anything but threats. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3964.6s)]
*  Whereas like, you know, a normal person, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3967.06s)]
*  your wife, your children, your friends, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3968.5s)]
*  anybody off the street, the lady at Dunkin' Donuts, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3970.42s)]
*  like they can all be reasoned with, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3972.94s)]
*  and they're moved by love, and you know, a cogent argument. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3974.38s)]
*  TV executives, it's like, if you don't have a gun [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3978.7000000000003s)]
*  in your hand, well, you just said you got the job [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3980.26s)]

*  Yeah, that's leverage. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3984.3s)]
*  That's it. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3985.6s)]
*  That's the only thing that moves. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3986.44s)]
*  The right thing will never be done. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3988.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3990.38s)]
*  Wait, someone else wants him? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3991.2200000000003s)]
*  All right, now we want him. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3992.32s)]
*  Move it over to here. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3993.38s)]
*  But that's life. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3994.86s)]
*  Leverage, I get it. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3997.14s)]
*  God, it's not my life. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=3999.52s)]
*  That's not the world that I live in outside of- [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4000.96s)]
*  It's not the world. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4002.56s)]
*  I'm leaving, you know, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4003.3999999999996s)]
*  I wish I had the wherewithal then to know what was happening. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4007.08s)]
*  It was so hot and so crazy, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4011.52s)]
*  and I had to hire a litigator and all these things, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4013.12s)]
*  and we ended up doing a deal with them to let me go, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4015.9199999999996s)]
*  and it was not my full contract, and it was, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4019.68s)]
*  and then the next day there's reports [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4023.0s)]
*  that Billy Bush got all this money. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4024.6s)]
*  It's not even half of what they reported. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4025.94s)]
*  It's like, it was a shit. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4028.16s)]
*  I had bought a place in New York that I was super proud of. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4031.8799999999997s)]
*  I took a bath on that. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4037.2s)]
*  I mean, you want a 360 shit show, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4039.3999999999996s)]
*  and it happened like that in an instant. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4041.8399999999997s)]
*  You're at the highest you've ever been in your career. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4047.2599999999998s)]
*  You can't believe it. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4050.16s)]
*  You've got drivers wherever you're going. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4051.24s)]
*  I'm maybe drinking a little bit of that Kool-Aid [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4053.16s)]
*  thinking I'm pretty cool, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4055.12s)]
*  and maybe, and here's the positive part. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4057.2000000000003s)]
*  Maybe God said, you're not ready for life yet. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4059.04s)]
*  Amazingly, you're 44 years old, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4063.6800000000003s)]
*  and you don't know what a struggle looks like. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4065.8s)]
*  You have had a pretty sheltered life. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4068.3s)]
*  I'm looking, trying to think of it on a bigger picture, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4070.1200000000003s)]
*  and you need, everyone in this life, no one goes unscathed. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4072.52s)]
*  Everyone has to get their doors blown off in some way. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4079.0800000000004s)]
*  Hopefully it's not cancer with a child [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4081.5s)]
*  or something terrible, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4083.7200000000003s)]
*  but it's gonna be something horrible [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4085.16s)]
*  that's gonna shake you to the core [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4087.92s)]
*  and you gotta figure it out. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4088.96s)]
*  This was mine. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4090.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm not extraordinary that I've had to deal [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4091.52s)]
*  with getting my doors blown off. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4094.12s)]
*  I'm only extraordinary in the details of it [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4095.96s)]
*  that the reality guy from 2005 [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4098.5599999999995s)]
*  is now destroying 16 other people [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4100.68s)]
*  to become the Republican candidate for president. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4104.28s)]
*  That's all very extraordinary, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4107.16s)]
*  but I think what happened then was three years of disaster [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4110.5s)]
*  and then getting back to work [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4117.66s)]
*  and slowly putting one foot after the other [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4118.78s)]
*  and leading to this moment now where I'm- [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4121.86s)]
*  The whole thing is just absolutely incredible. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4125.02s)]
*  I watched with amazement and real sadness. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4127.78s)]
*  By the way, you were one of the very, very, very few people [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4130.86s)]
*  that just didn't give a shit and called it for what it was. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4134.86s)]
*  Well, I was totally outraged by it [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4139.86s)]
*  and the lying behind it. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4141.54s)]
*  We talked about this affair, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4143.58s)]
*  but if they were like, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4144.5s)]
*  you know, what you said about Megyn Kelly, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4145.339999999999s)]
*  if they're like, okay, you know, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4147.62s)]
*  the returns aren't what we thought they were gonna be, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4149.179999999999s)]
*  we're gonna have to let you go, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4150.839999999999s)]
*  that's a totally reasonable thing to do. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4152.0599999999995s)]
*  If they had said Billy, we're just too embarrassed [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4154.4s)]
*  and let's work out some way or whatever, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4156.599999999999s)]
*  but they were morally high-handed with you. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4159.259999999999s)]
*  You committed some kind of crime [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4162.339999999999s)]
*  and I was outraged by that. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4163.7s)]
*  What did you do wrong? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4165.42s)]
*  I never understood it. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4166.96s)]
*  And then the small, you know, then I was unhireable. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4169.14s)]
*  I was just unhireable. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4172.46s)]
*  I didn't work for three years. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4173.38s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4174.94s)]
*  Three years is a long time. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4176.02s)]
*  I didn't work, couldn't get hired. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4177.38s)]
*  And to my fault, what I should have done [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4178.74s)]
*  is launch the Tucker Carlson Network right then and there. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4182.3s)]
*  The technology wasn't ready for it. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4184.9800000000005s)]
*  It wasn't, I wasn't ready. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4186.54s)]
*  I was like, no, damn it, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4188.2s)]
*  this big family that had me in it [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4190.18s)]
*  is gonna have me back because it isn't right [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4192.66s)]
*  and I'm gonna stick around until they do [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4194.9s)]
*  and finally I made it back, you know, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4196.66s)]
*  an extra at Warner Brothers hired me. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4200.66s)]
*  I've done it for five years [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4203.4s)]
*  and I'll forever be grateful to the woman [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4205.0199999999995s)]
*  who lives very close to you down here since she's retired, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4207.32s)]
*  Lisa G., who hired me and I got, you know, going again. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4210.46s)]
*  Sue, can you, without, you know, getting too painful, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4214.139999999999s)]
*  but to sort of linger on what those days, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4217.62s)]
*  you walk outside and the driver tells you [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4220.0199999999995s)]
*  that the car's been canceled. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4224.82s)]
*  So you call your lawyer, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4227.82s)]
*  did you call Noah Oppenheim and he lacked? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4228.9s)]
*  Yeah, I called Noah and I mean, and you know, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4231.54s)]
*  at that point everything goes to the lawyers. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4234.139999999999s)]
*  Their phones no longer answer. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4236.42s)]
*  So they're told by legal, you cannot talk to him at all [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4238.7s)]
*  and so. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4242.66s)]
*  But you never had another time. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4243.82s)]
*  Six months later, I talked to Noah Oppenheim. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4245.42s)]
*  But you never talked to him there in the middle of it. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4249.26s)]
*  And he said, Noah, there's a beautiful thing. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4250.98s)]
*  Noah said to me, if you never speak to me again, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4252.34s)]
*  if you hate my guts for the rest of your life, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4256.18s)]
*  I understand, I'm so sorry. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4257.860000000001s)]
*  It wasn't supposed to happen like this. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4261.34s)]
*  I am so sorry. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4262.82s)]
*  Well, I called Noah because I know Noah [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4263.66s)]
*  and I was, I'm not sure if I can say this, but I did. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4265.900000000001s)]
*  And I called him, he called me back. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4268.9400000000005s)]
*  I was in the car with one of my children [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4272.3s)]
*  coming back from a college tour. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4273.74s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4275.02s)]
*  And she was driving, she was just wanting to drive [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4275.860000000001s)]
*  because she's going to boarding school, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4277.860000000001s)]
*  she doesn't know how to drive. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4279.06s)]
*  Anyway, we're in the car. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4279.900000000001s)]
*  He calls me back on speaker. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4280.94s)]
*  And she reminded me of this actually last night [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4283.379999999999s)]
*  when we were saying you were coming. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4285.86s)]
*  And I completely lost control on him. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4287.74s)]
*  Like completely lost control, scared my daughter. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4289.259999999999s)]
*  Because I was just so, I mean, I've got nothing to do with it, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4291.259999999999s)]
*  but I was just so mad that someone could do. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4293.58s)]
*  Well, I felt it. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4296.66s)]
*  Like it's just so unfair. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4297.66s)]
*  And then you don't call the man directly [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4298.94s)]
*  and it's oh, through the lawyers legal won't let me. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4301.139999999999s)]
*  It's like, what? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4303.099999999999s)]
*  You just suspend all humanity and decency [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4304.299999999999s)]
*  because you work for some stupid company? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4306.54s)]
*  It's going to be gone in 10 years. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4308.419999999999s)]
*  There won't be an NBC. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4309.58s)]
*  All of this is passing away. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4310.7s)]
*  All of this is fake. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4311.9400000000005s)]
*  And what matters is treating other people with decency. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4313.54s)]
*  And they just forget that. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4316.26s)]
*  But there's a history of that at the Today Show. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4317.1s)]
*  If I were still the host of Access Hollywood [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4318.7s)]
*  and all of that had happened, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4320.82s)]
*  and I had never spent two months at the Today Show, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4321.78s)]
*  I hadn't made that very recent move. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4323.78s)]
*  I don't think they would have fired me at Access. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4325.66s)]
*  I think I kind of, I was the Matt Lauer of the place. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4327.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a smaller place, but I'd been there so long. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4331.3s)]
*  People looked up to me. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4334.22s)]
*  I kind of had influence. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4335.1s)]
*  I could, they wouldn't have done it. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4336.26s)]
*  They needed me. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4337.78s)]
*  But remember, I'd gotten to the Today Show [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4339.18s)]
*  where half the place didn't want me there [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4340.9800000000005s)]
*  in the first place. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4342.66s)]
*  So it was definitely inside politics. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4343.700000000001s)]
*  Mean girls, high school shit. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4346.06s)]
*  And now, I mean, things, it's so long ago [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4347.820000000001s)]
*  and things have changed so much [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4350.42s)]
*  that I kind of feel sorry for Matt Lauer, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4352.54s)]
*  who at the time I was outraged. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4354.3s)]
*  And I laid into him, by the way, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4355.54s)]
*  I got to speak to Matt Lauer nine months afterwards. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4356.860000000001s)]
*  And he and I said, you know. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4359.42s)]
*  Had he fallen yet? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4360.26s)]
*  He had not fallen yet. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4361.740000000001s)]
*  But he called me with some bullshit about, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4363.14s)]
*  I can't believe that Trump is president [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4364.9800000000005s)]
*  and you lost your job, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4366.9800000000005s)]
*  which is the number one thing I hear from everyone. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4367.94s)]
*  But I was like, not from you, asshole. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4369.98s)]
*  And I laid into him. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4372.0199999999995s)]
*  And I laid, please don't try that on me. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4373.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not dumb. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4375.78s)]
*  I mean, you're the leader. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4376.74s)]
*  I said, you're the leader of that place. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4378.0199999999995s)]
*  You could have fought for me and you didn't. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4379.86s)]
*  And I know why you didn't. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4381.379999999999s)]
*  Because you didn't want me [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4383.0199999999995s)]
*  and my full head of hair in that building. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4383.86s)]
*  And I get it. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4386.259999999999s)]
*  I laid and he said, no, no, no, I fought for you privately. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4388.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like, no, you didn't, dude. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4390.179999999999s)]
*  I know you didn't. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4392.0199999999995s)]
*  And your minions didn't. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4393.259999999999s)]
*  And shut up and save it. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4394.7s)]
*  And then when he got fired, I was like, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4397.06s)]
*  hey, are you okay? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4400.3s)]
*  Here's some books, try these three books. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4402.06s)]
*  I did the same. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4403.660000000001s)]
*  I did. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4404.5s)]
*  I also texted him. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4405.34s)]
*  I never liked him, but I always text people [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4406.18s)]
*  when they get fired, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4408.740000000001s)]
*  just because I feel like we should do that. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4409.580000000001s)]
*  We should. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4411.14s)]
*  You don't wanna. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4412.14s)]
*  I texted Jeff Zucker when he got fired. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4412.9800000000005s)]
*  You did? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4416.02s)]
*  Yes, and the funny thing is, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4416.860000000001s)]
*  I really disliked Jeff Zucker intensely. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4419.580000000001s)]
*  I worked for him and I intensely disliked him. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4422.22s)]
*  I like the way you say intensely. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4424.34s)]
*  I did and he got fired and I was in bed. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4425.62s)]
*  I was in the morning and someone said, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4428.58s)]
*  Zucker just got fired. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4430.0199999999995s)]
*  And I texted him immediately. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4430.86s)]
*  It's two liner, you know, cause been there [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4433.66s)]
*  and never heard back from him. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4435.54s)]
*  This was four years ago, probably three or four years ago. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4437.58s)]
*  And I was at a lunch in Abu Dhabi last week [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4440.54s)]
*  and guess who sat next to me? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4443.9s)]
*  Jeff Zucker. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4445.42s)]
*  Wait, he didn't choose to sit. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4446.82s)]
*  No, he just wound up. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4448.099999999999s)]
*  Wait, his placard, his name plate was next to you. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4449.099999999999s)]
*  Yes, I sit down at lunch. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4452.58s)]
*  In an official capacity, this is some type of event. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4455.7s)]
*  Yeah, I was just traveling and- [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4458.419999999999s)]

*  Billy Bush wants Matt Lauer's job and he's gone in for it. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4560.82s)]
*  And this is just stuff that in no way is true [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4564.62s)]
*  because I'm trying to build a nine o'clock [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4570.42s)]
*  Regis style show. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4573.7s)]

*  the top of the building with like a jazz quartet, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4576.94s)]
*  like a morning live audience. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4578.94s)]
*  We had all these wonderful plans. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4580.86s)]

*  But he read all these things and he thought [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4587.42s)]
*  that I was planting them through my quote unquote team, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4590.0599999999995s)]

*  she was like, how do I, like, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4774.42s)]
*  they just keep having me do the same things. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4775.62s)]
*  How do I get out of this? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4777.58s)]
*  And I gave her some advice and I said, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4778.42s)]
*  well, just stop interviewing your dad, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4780.78s)]
*  like every week, don't do that. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4782.62s)]
*  That's a start. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4785.299999999999s)]
*  And then, but she's done incredibly well. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4786.7s)]
*  And she, you know, I love her [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4790.259999999999s)]
*  and she, terrible situation for her to be in [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4793.339999999999s)]
*  while they're, you know, totally defenestrating [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4796.179999999999s)]
*  your cousin and you move up. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4800.14s)]
*  Yeah, that is. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4803.900000000001s)]
*  Poor thing. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4804.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, I felt as badly for her because it's just, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4805.780000000001s)]
*  you know, it's just awkward. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4809.02s)]
*  She didn't want it that way. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4811.42s)]
*  Oh, of course not. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4812.5s)]
*  Of course not, wow. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4814.9400000000005s)]
*  Also, she had. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4815.9400000000005s)]
*  And we have great fun today. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4816.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, I saw her recently and we always have laughs [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4817.62s)]
*  and everything's wonderful. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4819.780000000001s)]
*  And recently ran into Phil Griffin. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4822.740000000001s)]
*  No way. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4825.06s)]
*  From MSNBC. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4825.900000000001s)]
*  Buddy, as we call them. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4826.740000000001s)]
*  Well, I thought he was behind all this [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4827.58s)]
*  and I was ready to lay into him. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4830.74s)]
*  And I started to. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4831.98s)]
*  And he was like, no, no, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4833.74s)]
*  the man that fired you, I hate him too. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4835.82s)]
*  Lack. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4837.98s)]
*  Yeah, everybody hates lack. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4838.82s)]
*  The one thing everyone agrees on is that Andy Lack [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4840.299999999999s)]
*  is a very bad guy. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4843.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4844.86s)]
*  Phil Griffin fired me and it's one of the very, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4845.7s)]
*  maybe the only firing, I've had a lot of firings, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4849.259999999999s)]
*  but it was the only one where I had no hard feelings [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4851.179999999999s)]
*  whatsoever. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4853.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4854.0199999999995s)]
*  And he called me in at Thanksgiving, I'll never forget it. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4854.86s)]
*  And I was about to take the train back to Washington. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4857.26s)]
*  He goes, hey, can I talk to you for a sec? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4860.38s)]
*  Buddy, called everyone buddy. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4861.42s)]
*  Buddy. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4862.900000000001s)]
*  Probably still does. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4863.740000000001s)]
*  And he goes, hey, we hired you here at MSNBC. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4864.56s)]
*  We were hoping to move the channel right [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4868.1s)]
*  to compete with Fox. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4869.42s)]
*  That didn't work. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4870.26s)]
*  And then you brought in Rachel Maddow onto your show [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4872.26s)]
*  and it turns out she's way more popular [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4874.9800000000005s)]
*  with her audience than you. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4876.22s)]
*  So we're gonna let you go because it didn't work. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4877.34s)]
*  But we'll pay out your contract and it's totally fine. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4880.7s)]
*  He was so direct with me and honest with me. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4883.9s)]
*  That's exactly what, I mean, first he started, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4887.94s)]
*  he was like attacking me in the New York Post page six [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4890.339999999999s)]
*  and I called him up and I yelled at him. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4893.78s)]
*  Do we have to do it this way? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4895.74s)]
*  We have to do it this way. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4896.98s)]
*  The news people have to do it this way. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4897.82s)]
*  They have to. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4899.9s)]
*  They have to use the gossip pages in New York. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4900.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4902.58s)]
*  It's so sad. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4903.419999999999s)]
*  To crush you and whatever. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4904.259999999999s)]
*  But once I called him on that and he stopped, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4905.66s)]
*  he was totally honorable about it. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4909.7s)]
*  And I obviously don't like or approve of MSNBC, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4913.46s)]
*  but I've never attacked Phil Griffin [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4917.5s)]
*  because he paid me the honor of directness. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4919.22s)]
*  I like that. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4923.46s)]
*  Me too. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4924.3s)]
*  What he said to me in June was when I was coming after him [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4925.12s)]
*  I wanted to corner him. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4928.34s)]
*  He said, no, I asked Andy, hey, you've helped, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4930.5s)]
*  what's his name, Brian Williams before, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4936.82s)]
*  like you stand up for people that we like [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4938.34s)]
*  and Billy Bush is a good guy. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4940.98s)]
*  Like what are you gonna do about Billy? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4943.14s)]
*  And Andy said to him, he told me, fuck Billy Bush. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4943.9800000000005s)]
*  Who gives a shit? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4947.66s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4948.9400000000005s)]
*  Billy Bush, what? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4949.9400000000005s)]
*  Doesn't matter, he's nothing. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4950.86s)]
*  Forget him. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4952.14s)]
*  And so literally just, and I thought, oh my God. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4953.18s)]
*  But it endorsed that everybody, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4959.26s)]
*  the other reason Andy Lack is a terrible guy. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4962.62s)]
*  My dad called two people on my behalf. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4964.7s)]
*  My father, bless his heart. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4969.22s)]
*  You called Noah Oppenheim. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4971.3s)]
*  My dad called Andy Lack and he's like a really [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4972.74s)]
*  high integrity, clean fighting guy. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4976.74s)]
*  Only tells clean jokes. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4979.14s)]
*  Calls up and says, he says, Andy, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4981.42s)]
*  I don't know if you know this. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4984.22s)]
*  No, he wrote him a letter. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4985.54s)]
*  He says, I've recently had a case of the shingles. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4986.62s)]
*  I don't know if you've had a case of the shingles before, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4988.9400000000005s)]
*  but they're very, very painful [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4990.88s)]
*  and I just hope that one befalls you soon. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4992.320000000001s)]
*  You're a horrible person, Jonathan Bush. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4995.9800000000005s)]
*  He's since died three years ago. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=4999.02s)]
*  But then he also called Steve Burke [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5000.7s)]
*  because back in the day, dad knew his father, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5002.86s)]
*  not well, but his father was Dan Burke [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5006.94s)]
*  who ran Cap Cities ABC. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5008.98s)]
*  So Steve Burke, who was the CEO [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5011.26s)]
*  and chairman of NBC at the time, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5014.26s)]
*  dad called him and said, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5017.5s)]
*  there's no way this apple could have fallen far [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5019.3s)]
*  from the tree. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5021.179999999999s)]
*  What you're doing to my son is unbelievable. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5022.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a character, so you're killing this guy. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5026.0199999999995s)]
*  And he didn't do anything. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5028.42s)]
*  And shame on you. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5030.02s)]
*  There's no way the apple fell that far from the tree. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5031.1s)]
*  Your dad was an honorable, honorable man. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5033.22s)]
*  He was like, I'm so sorry. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5036.06s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5037.46s)]
*  I'm just out of my hands. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5038.700000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5039.660000000001s)]
*  So sorry. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5040.4800000000005s)]
*  And I was like, that was it. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5041.320000000001s)]
*  But of the people, always reach out when someone's down [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5042.900000000001s)]
*  and always call to tell someone an asshole [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5047.38s)]
*  that they're an asshole when they are. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5049.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5050.820000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5051.660000000001s)]
*  But be direct. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5052.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's- Be direct. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5053.320000000001s)]
*  And that's why you'll never hear me attack Phil Griffin, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5054.240000000001s)]
*  even though- Right, good. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5056.76s)]
*  And me neither. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5058.1s)]
*  It cleared, so I wanted to like him so much. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5059.099999999999s)]
*  And then I was like, but he, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5061.78s)]
*  I remember his face like walking out of Andy Lack's office [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5063.62s)]
*  when the plan was in motion to fire me. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5068.0599999999995s)]
*  MSNBC was never first on the air with a story. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5070.0199999999995s)]
*  And they were first on the air with the bus story [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5072.54s)]
*  because they knew it was coming. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5075.28s)]
*  It was a setup. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5076.78s)]
*  They had colluded. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5077.62s)]
*  So just one detail that I alighted over, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5078.66s)]
*  which is how it got from the vaults at NBC News [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5081.259999999999s)]
*  to the Washington Post. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5085.86s)]
*  Who did it go to? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5087.099999999999s)]
*  We don't know exactly, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5088.06s)]
*  but if you wanna begin the internal investigation, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5089.5s)]
*  Noah Oppenheim is the president of NBC. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5092.580000000001s)]
*  He's the head of the, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5096.34s)]
*  he's general manager of the Today Show. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5097.38s)]
*  His co-editor of the Harvard Crimson newspaper, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5099.900000000001s)]
*  back when he was a Harvard man, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5104.26s)]
*  was a writer named David Fahrenheit [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5107.34s)]
*  from the Washington Post. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5110.42s)]
*  And Fahrenheit is the one. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5111.580000000001s)]
*  They ran the Crimson together. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5112.900000000001s)]
*  They were both groomsmen in Chelsea Clinton's wedding. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5115.0199999999995s)]
*  Actually? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5120.98s)]
*  Co-groomsmen, oh yeah, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5121.82s)]
*  cause one of their other buddies [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5122.7s)]
*  was the guy that Chelsea married. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5123.98s)]
*  So they were groomsmen in the wedding together. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5125.98s)]
*  Anyway, that guy's the one who released. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5128.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like the paper trail is terrible. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5129.82s)]
*  I mean, it could start there. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5131.98s)]
*  No way. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5132.82s)]
*  So the college buddy of the NBC president. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5133.66s)]
*  He's now a writer at Washington Post. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5136.94s)]
*  And then two years later, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5138.379999999999s)]
*  a year and a half later, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5139.459999999999s)]
*  he gets his own NBC News contributing gig. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5140.4s)]
*  And he gets a sweet gig over at MSNBC. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5143.7s)]
*  So they pay him back for the hustle. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5146.179999999999s)]
*  That's where I would start the investigation. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5149.26s)]
*  I'm not saying that that happened, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5151.179999999999s)]
*  but I would begin there [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5152.82s)]
*  and just see if it saves you some time. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5154.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5156.139999999999s)]
*  Now I can guarantee you that here's the good thing about Noah, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5158.9s)]
*  that Noah didn't want to do this. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5162.7s)]
*  I'm his only hire. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5164.42s)]
*  He was new on the job and he made one move. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5165.74s)]
*  I'm gonna change that third hour. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5168.32s)]
*  I'm putting Billy Bush in there. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5169.74s)]
*  He's got personality. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5170.98s)]
*  That's the guy we want. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5172.2s)]
*  Boom, he makes his one hire. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5174.66s)]
*  Then this thing blows up on him and Lack, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5176.66s)]
*  no question, turns to him and says, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5178.38s)]
*  get this tape out into the world. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5181.82s)]
*  Find a way to do it. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5185.82s)]
*  And he did not want to, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5187.66s)]
*  but this was the obvious way. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5189.58s)]
*  So, you know, his only choice was to say, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5191.3s)]
*  no, Andy, I'm not gonna do that. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5194.66s)]
*  It's wrong. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5195.5s)]
*  I hired the guy and we shouldn't do that to him. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5196.34s)]
*  But he didn't. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5198.54s)]
*  What happened to Andy Lack? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5200.46s)]
*  He's been fired. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5202.66s)]
*  To be fair, everyone who was involved in all of this [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5204.46s)]
*  has all since been fired. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5206.86s)]
*  This is honest. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5208.3s)]
*  Everyone's been fired. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5209.14s)]
*  This is like the Soviet Union where, you know, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5209.96s)]
*  all the early Bolsheviks commit these mass murders. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5212.82s)]
*  It's not worth it, folks. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5214.98s)]
*  Then they're all killed. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5215.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5216.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5217.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5218.5199999999995s)]
*  Kamenev, Zinoviev, Trotsky, all die. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5219.36s)]
*  But Lack is now, I've been told at PBS somewhere, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5220.74s)]
*  producing some series. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5224.14s)]
*  Why was he fired from NBC? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5224.98s)]
*  Just one bungle after the next. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5228.62s)]
*  The Me Too movement came [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5231.18s)]
*  and the Harvey Weinstein thing, he bungled. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5233.820000000001s)]
*  And then he bungled the Brian Williams, that disaster. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5236.860000000001s)]
*  And then the Matt Lauer disaster. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5240.02s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5241.56s)]
*  they're just like, this is not a good guy. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5242.860000000001s)]
*  Was Brian Williams on your side? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5246.3s)]
*  He wasn't. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5248.780000000001s)]
*  He never reached out. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5249.62s)]
*  I mean, I like Brian. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5252.1s)]
*  I have no reason not to. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5255.22s)]
*  I always had fun with Tom Brokaw. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5258.22s)]
*  He was on the same floor as me where my office was. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5261.62s)]
*  Craig Melvin was right next to me, loved Craig. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5263.099999999999s)]
*  Craig came up to me at a country club. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5265.5s)]
*  I was having lunch with an old agent of mine [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5267.62s)]
*  out in Roweaton. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5269.46s)]
*  I went out there to have lunch with an old agent [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5270.86s)]
*  who was kind of in poor health. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5273.58s)]
*  So I just went to see him. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5277.099999999999s)]
*  And I ran into Craig and his wife and their kids [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5278.66s)]
*  in the parking lot. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5280.58s)]
*  And he said, I'm so sorry. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5281.54s)]
*  What happened to you? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5283.82s)]
*  You were such a good guy. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5285.379999999999s)]
*  And I just, it's terrible. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5286.82s)]
*  Is he still there? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5289.259999999999s)]
*  He just got the big promotion. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5291.5s)]
*  He's in the lower chair. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5292.42s)]
*  Oh, maybe he planned this whole day. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5294.099999999999s)]
*  He took this a long plan, Craig. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5296.5s)]
*  That's an eight year plan. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5298.5s)]
*  No, great guy, lovely, decent singing voice. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5299.34s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5304.58s)]
*  So the people you know, you still must know people [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5305.42s)]
*  in linear television at the Today Show or other places. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5308.38s)]
*  How are they feeling about the prospects of their business? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5311.42s)]
*  There's like a few big contracts left, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5314.7s)]
*  but they're all shrinking. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5316.3s)]
*  Like Stephanopoulos just renegotiated to come down. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5317.18s)]
*  Everyone's coming down. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5319.98s)]
*  They're all coming down to earth. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5321.219999999999s)]
*  Hoda left, but there's still plenty of 20, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5322.82s)]
*  $25 million a year people, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5325.7s)]
*  like everyone on Good Morning America. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5328.0599999999995s)]
*  But all their renegotiations come down. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5331.179999999999s)]
*  The whole thing is slowly. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5333.62s)]
*  The low is for the next five, 10 years, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5335.299999999999s)]
*  I think there'll be a place for that morning TV, right? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5338.419999999999s)]
*  But not at these astronomical. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5342.259999999999s)]
*  It doesn't feel like it drives anything anymore. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5345.74s)]
*  Well, it's so scared. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5349.22s)]
*  It doesn't take an opinion. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5350.26s)]
*  It doesn't take a position. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5351.26s)]
*  It doesn't, it's the competent, they're not competing. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5352.46s)]
*  Today Show and Good Morning America are not competing [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5358.06s)]
*  to win or to grow. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5361.58s)]
*  It's who can die the slowest. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5363.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5365.900000000001s)]
*  That's the fight. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5366.900000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't, I mean, it used to be for decades, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5367.820000000001s)]
*  if it appeared in the first hour of the Today Show, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5371.9400000000005s)]
*  it kind of defined the news. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5374.06s)]
*  7.35 AM was known as the money slack. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5375.98s)]
*  Whatever errors, still to this day, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5379.459999999999s)]
*  whatever errors at 7.35, folks, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5381.86s)]
*  that's the best thing they got. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5383.94s)]
*  And after that, you can move on. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5385.299999999999s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like it like determines [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5386.58s)]
*  what people are talking about at 8.35 anymore. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5388.78s)]
*  No. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5391.7s)]

*  No, the internet is- [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5393.5s)]
*  Just ate it. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5396.099999999999s)]
*  Ate, eating, destroying everyone. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5397.299999999999s)]
*  It's an insatiable belly. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5399.139999999999s)]
*  It can't get enough. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5401.419999999999s)]
*  So what'd you do after, so you get canned [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5402.459999999999s)]
*  and then what happens? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5406.74s)]
*  So I get canned and my life falls apart [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5407.58s)]
*  and I start drinking heavily. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5409.42s)]
*  I've pathetically cry and cry and cry [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5414.74s)]
*  and I can't get, I just have like anxiety and panic [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5417.98s)]
*  and I end up going to this place called the Hoffman Process. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5423.86s)]
*  The day that Donald Trump walked in [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5426.82s)]
*  for his first day of work as president of the United States [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5429.46s)]
*  was the day that I walked in, turned in my phone [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5433.42s)]
*  and checked in for nine days in a mental health retreat [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5436.82s)]
*  because I couldn't sleep, I couldn't, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5442.1s)]
*  the panic and the anxiety was just, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5445.26s)]
*  cancellation, like at that level, it's severe. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5448.18s)]
*  The mental toll, we're fortified now. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5452.58s)]
*  Nothing could happen like that again to me. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5456.26s)]
*  I had to learn the hard way [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5458.22s)]
*  and I was maybe especially weak at the time. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5459.1s)]
*  So far from Marcus Aurelius that I couldn't handle that [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5462.62s)]
*  but I wanted to, I had suicidal ideation. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5470.38s)]
*  I had like, I was on a balcony in this place I was renting [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5472.86s)]
*  and I was like, and I had to lay down on the ground [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5476.0599999999995s)]
*  because I felt myself like wanting to go [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5478.58s)]
*  to just get away from, I had paparazzi everywhere outside [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5480.86s)]
*  following me, saying shit to me [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5485.14s)]
*  and I just got so bad that I went to this place [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5486.86s)]
*  and that was my first, that was in January of 17 [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5490.14s)]
*  and that was my first step in putting myself together. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5493.660000000001s)]
*  I walked on the flames with Tony Robbins. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5497.9800000000005s)]
*  I read every book you could read. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5500.58s)]
*  I started yoga. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5503.02s)]
*  I found this amazing pastor who became my friend. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5505.26s)]
*  I have this wonderful photo of me in church [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5510.660000000001s)]
*  at this church, Zoé Church in Los Angeles, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5513.740000000001s)]
*  Pastor Chad Veach, a really great guy [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5516.18s)]
*  and I didn't know he was doing it. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5517.98s)]
*  I mean, he said everybody, he said a prayer for me out loud [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5520.179999999999s)]
*  and everyone in the congregation reached forward [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5523.54s)]
*  and put their hand on my shoulders. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5525.98s)]
*  I like fell apart crying and I was like, okay, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5528.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna put myself back together. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5530.62s)]
*  This is, we'll fortify here. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5533.66s)]
*  And then you just one step after the next [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5536.86s)]
*  and step after the next and then you get going [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5538.9s)]
*  and life gets better. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5542.62s)]
*  I didn't think it would, but it's like, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5544.5s)]
*  now it's about to get much better [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5548.94s)]
*  as I follow great pioneers like you and Megan [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5550.78s)]
*  and others and do things my way. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5556.1s)]
*  Just people who've been fired, yeah. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5558.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5560.42s)]
*  It's, so look, you know, I mean, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5561.26s)]
*  it's probably hard even to think of it, [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5565.26s)]
*  but I wonder if like when you're 70, you won't think, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5566.7s)]
*  you know, it's probably, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5571.9s)]
*  what was it all bad, that experience? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5573.38s)]
*  I think that's right. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5575.099999999999s)]
*  People will say to you when you're having [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5576.139999999999s)]
*  in the shittiest time of your life, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5577.82s)]
*  they'll say, it's all gonna work out in the end. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5580.0199999999995s)]
*  It's all gonna be a reason. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5583.54s)]
*  It's all believe me, once you get through it, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5584.98s)]
*  life will never be, and I think there's truth to that. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5586.98s)]
*  You just gotta get to the other side. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5589.82s)]
*  I wasn't ready for anything bad to happen to me [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5592.38s)]
*  and now I'm ready for whatever comes next. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5595.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5598.5s)]
*  I really am. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5599.34s)]
*  I'm not an, I can handle it. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5600.68s)]
*  Whatever it is, I can handle it. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5603.5199999999995s)]
*  And also to go and do the show [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5605.32s)]
*  that I'm about to go do on my own, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5607.96s)]
*  I think it's helpful to know what it feels like to be down. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5611.96s)]
*  No matter who you're talking to, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5616.44s)]
*  if you're a professional communicator, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5617.72s)]
*  to know what it feels like to be down [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5620.2s)]
*  is a really important tool. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5623.92s)]
*  I strongly agree with that. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5627.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5628.76s)]
*  I also think I've noticed, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5629.76s)]
*  certainly noticed it in my own life [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5630.8s)]
*  that success isn't necessarily great for men [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5632.24s)]
*  and especially men, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5635.84s)]
*  and it does, you do get filled with hubris actually. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5637.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5641.52s)]
*  Oh, I thought I was a cool guy. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5642.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I've been there. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5644.16s)]
*  I've been there. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5645.0s)]
*  I'm not mocking you in any way [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5645.820000000001s)]
*  because I've certainly been there. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5646.66s)]
*  And in fact, I've been there so much [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5647.8s)]
*  that when I got fired the last time, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5650.0s)]
*  Susie, my wife, she was like thrilled. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5651.96s)]
*  I got fired, absolutely thrilled. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5655.24s)]
*  She didn't like the employer anyway. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5656.400000000001s)]
*  She thought that they were. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5659.08s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5660.24s)]
*  Yeah, she was actually walking the dogs [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5661.08s)]
*  and I called her and I was like, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5663.48s)]
*  I just got fired and she goes, why? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5664.32s)]
*  I said, I don't know, they didn't tell me. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5666.32s)]
*  She goes, I'm so glad. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5667.32s)]
*  Oh my God, I love you so much, Susie. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5669.48s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5671.96s)]
*  She's the best. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5672.8s)]
*  Yeah, and she never said it or would say it, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5673.96s)]
*  but I do think she on a gut level understood. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5677.24s)]
*  It's like it's important for a man [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5679.84s)]
*  to have setbacks once in a while [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5682.12s)]
*  because it reminds you what's important. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5683.92s)]
*  These are all cliches for a reason, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5686.16s)]
*  but it reminds you that you're not God [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5687.6s)]
*  and you need to know that. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5690.200000000001s)]
*  That's really important to know that. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5691.360000000001s)]
*  And if life was just one rosy contract after the next [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5692.68s)]
*  and look at me, look at me, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5695.6s)]
*  what kind of textured life would that be? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5697.4400000000005s)]
*  You can't come back and triumph over something [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5699.92s)]
*  if you got nothing to triumph over. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5703.320000000001s)]
*  So that's just the way life is, right? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5705.320000000001s)]
*  Well, you look at Lauer and Roker [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5707.120000000001s)]
*  and they're hardly alone in this, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5709.88s)]
*  but they're like legitimately successful people in television. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5711.4400000000005s)]
*  They're the most successful people in television. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5714.160000000001s)]
*  Very, very rich and in long run. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5715.88s)]
*  And very long run. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5717.72s)]
*  Lauer's run unbelievably, Roker's even longer. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5719.32s)]
*  By the way, take me out, but not after two months. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5721.72s)]
*  How about after 20 years [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5724.2s)]
*  when I'm sitting on a giant pile of money? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5725.84s)]
*  Why wouldn't you pay off the mortgage? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5728.32s)]
*  But why are they so unhappy? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5729.92s)]
*  Like I've wondered this, I got on a TV in 1995, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5731.96s)]
*  it says 30 years, I've always noticed that [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5735.08s)]
*  that the most successful people are like miserable. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5737.84s)]
*  Someone yesterday told me, knows Larry Fink, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5740.8s)]
*  who's like one of the richest people in the world, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5743.88s)]
*  runs BlackRock, he said Larry Fink, really smart, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5745.8s)]
*  complicated person, not all bad, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5748.76s)]
*  but the marker, the distinguishing characteristic [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5751.0s)]
*  of Larry Fink is he's miserable. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5754.400000000001s)]
*  He's truly unhappy. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5755.64s)]
*  What is that? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5758.400000000001s)]
*  Why are so many very successful people miserable? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5759.32s)]
*  I don't know, but I do know [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5763.4800000000005s)]
*  that I don't wanna be a billionaire. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5765.2s)]
*  I'm not interested in, no thanks. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5767.4400000000005s)]
*  Amen. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5769.36s)]
*  I wanna have enough to do the things [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5770.2s)]
*  that I wanna be able to go scheme once in a while. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5772.16s)]
*  But why do you say that? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5774.04s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5774.88s)]
*  Because there's, I mean, not to say more money, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5775.72s)]
*  more problems, but it's a drug like anything else. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5778.6s)]
*  Keep taking it, keep taking it, give me more, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5782.56s)]

*  It's never gonna satisfy. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5785.76s)]
*  It's just never gonna satisfy. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5787.320000000001s)]
*  What I want is- [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5788.76s)]
*  And you've seen that. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5789.6s)]
*  I'm not doing what I'm doing. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5790.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not launching my new show to become rich on my own [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5791.6s)]

*  in a completely honest, authentic, funny way. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5807.16s)]
*  And I don't, the truth isn't gonna appeal to everyone, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5809.799999999999s)]
*  but the truth matters. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5813.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5815.08s)]
*  I care more about that. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5816.04s)]
*  I care about being stimulated every day. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5817.679999999999s)]
*  And if we do well, that's awesome. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5820.08s)]
*  So it sounds like the, just in, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5823.08s)]
*  you're telling the three years of not working were, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5825.5599999999995s)]
*  it's not good not to work. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5828.36s)]
*  It's not good not to work. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5829.76s)]
*  You gotta get up and have someplace to go. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5830.8s)]
*  That's, you need to have something you're doing. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5832.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5836.2s)]
*  And not, I just kept thinking, how could they betray? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5837.04s)]
*  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5839.6s)]
*  How could they betray me like this? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5841.52s)]
*  Oh, I couldn't get out of my own way. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5843.52s)]
*  I was like, just so mad. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5845.280000000001s)]
*  My brother said something beautiful. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5846.280000000001s)]
*  He said, when you get over all this, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5847.92s)]
*  you're gonna get over it. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5849.4400000000005s)]
*  And when you do, you're gonna get the opportunity [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5850.400000000001s)]
*  to come back as yourself. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5852.320000000001s)]
*  Well, your brother, speaking of getting screwed, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5854.24s)]
*  totally different line of work- [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5857.24s)]
*  He got screwed. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5858.24s)]
*  He knows what it feels like to have an activist, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5859.08s)]
*  activist investor throw you out of the company you built. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5861.44s)]
*  And I talked to him the other day about something random [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5864.599999999999s)]
*  and sounded totally happy and at peace. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5867.5199999999995s)]
*  Totally. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5869.5599999999995s)]
*  Now he's overcome that and you know what he did? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5870.8s)]
*  He launched, he started another one. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5872.92s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5875.88s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a new healthcare company called Zeus Health. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5876.719999999999s)]
*  So he started Athena and Zeus is the father of Athena. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5879.04s)]
*  So he's reminding everyone who built it. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5882.5199999999995s)]
*  It's also A to Z. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5883.36s)]
*  Yeah, A to Z. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5885.28s)]
*  How did you get over that? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5887.36s)]
*  How did you forgive? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5889.32s)]
*  Because you actually, I think it's fair to say, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5890.5599999999995s)]
*  at this point, we're almost two hours in, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5892.36s)]
*  and anyone who's followed this, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5894.44s)]
*  I think would agree you did get shafted. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5895.5199999999995s)]
*  How did you forgive? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5897.759999999999s)]
*  Because, well, my executive producer who sent the tape, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5901.599999999999s)]
*  he was only looking to cover his ass in case he used it [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5904.5599999999995s)]
*  and Trump sued. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5908.2s)]
*  So when I really thought about it, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5910.24s)]
*  I'm like, he was trying to cover himself. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5912.2s)]
*  He wasn't trying to hurt me. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5914.96s)]
*  It ended up really hurting me, but he didn't mean to. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5916.4400000000005s)]
*  And the good times that I've had with him [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5919.8s)]
*  far outweigh the bad. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5921.6s)]
*  We've traveled all over the world to the Olympics [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5922.84s)]
*  and all these different things [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5924.84s)]
*  and covered so many things together [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5925.72s)]
*  and we really work well together. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5927.24s)]
*  So we healed the friendship [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5929.04s)]
*  and now he's gonna be the producer of my new show [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5930.76s)]
*  and we're back together again. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5933.04s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5934.04s)]
*  Am I a big person or what? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5934.88s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5936.320000000001s)]
*  That little shit, but I love him [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5938.8s)]
*  and now he works for me and I don't work for him. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5942.32s)]
*  So, but with Noah, I knew that Noah [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5945.5199999999995s)]
*  was just doing what they told him to do [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5950.5199999999995s)]
*  and he didn't have, he just arrived to this giant machine [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5952.28s)]
*  and he didn't have the guts to say no. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5954.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5957.84s)]
*  We're doing the right thing. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5958.679999999999s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5959.799999999999s)]
*  Most people would have done what he did, most. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5962.12s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5964.799999999999s)]
*  Takes a really big person of character to not do that. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5965.639999999999s)]
*  So I forgave him. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5968.08s)]
*  And. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5970.04s)]
*  What's he doing now? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5971.28s)]
*  The only one I don't forgive is Andy [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5972.4s)]
*  and I could if he came to me and asked for it, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5973.92s)]

*  I tried calling him once and so I'm fine not forgiving him. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=5979.4s)]

*  Do you do rinse out? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6084.84s)]
*  Do you do a little rinse out? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6085.68s)]
*  I actually honestly wash my hair with Dr. Bronner's bar soap. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6087.0s)]
*  So, and I shave with it and I use no products whatsoever. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6090.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6095.04s)]

*  Big hair. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6109.24s)]
*  Big hair. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6110.08s)]
*  It was bigger than the 80s. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6111.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6112.68s)]
*  You were an animal, man. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6113.8s)]
*  This guy, what a, this is, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6114.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6118.72s)]
*  Well, that was wonderful. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6119.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6120.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6121.4400000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6122.26s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6123.24s)]
*  I know. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6131.6s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6132.4400000000005s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6135.0s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6136.24s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6139.0s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6142.16s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6143.84s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6145.4s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6146.32s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6148.0s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6149.24s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6150.56s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6152.32s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6156.32s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6158.36s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6160.36s)]
*  Subscribe, and you'll have a much higher chance [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6162.32s)]
*  of hearing what we say, and we hope you will. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l15VvBvNRbM&t=6166.2s)]
