# Dr. Mary Talley Bowden: How Vaccines Got Politicized and the Medical Industry Lost All Credibility
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE)
*  So thank you for coming. So I want to, okay, here's my question to you. You were one of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=0.0s)]
*  people who was right about COVID and certainly more right than the US public health authorities [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  and the global public health authorities. And I'm just going to summarize in two sentences what I [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  think your position was. So you're a physician in private practice in Texas and you're vaccinated, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=17.52s)]
*  by the way. No. You were not, oh, you're not vaccinated. I almost did. God bless you. But [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=26.32s)]
*  at first you like have no real reason to think that this is all completely backward. But then [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=32.4s)]
*  you treat COVID patients, thousands, I think, and you start to realize that the therapies [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=37.76s)]
*  that the US government is recommending are not working, that the vaccines are not working as [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=43.92s)]
*  advertised at all. And you start saying something about it and offering alternatives to it, which [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=47.92s)]
*  are badly needed in the middle of this moment. And you're attacked, really attacked, your [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=55.2s)]
*  livelihood, your professional credentials are attacked. And then time passes now four years, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  and it becomes really clear that once again, you were more right than the US public health [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=68.48s)]
*  authorities. I think that's just demonstrable. I think the science proves that. So here's my [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=74.48s)]
*  question after a long preamble. Have you been rewarded for it? Has the AMA given you the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=79.12s)]
*  Physician of the Year Award? No, I'm serious. Has anybody said we were wrong in attacking you [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=83.92s)]
*  and you deserve credit for your foresight and bravery? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=90.72s)]
*  No, and I mean, I'm still fighting to keep my license. I mean, I still have the Texas Medical [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=114.88s)]
*  Board coming after me for something that happened. Right now you're fighting? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=120.8s)]
*  Yeah. I have a hearing coming up end of April. And I was trying to save somebody's life. It was a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=126.64s)]
*  sheriff's deputy. This is a man that has served for 29 years trying to protect and save the public, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=134.64s)]
*  father of six. And he contracted COVID. And this was in the fall of 2021. And that was the third [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=141.2s)]
*  and the largest surge of the pandemic. This was following the rollout of the COVID shots. So this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=148.48s)]
*  was eight months following the rollout of the COVID shots, and they clearly weren't working. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  And this man, he got sick. He tried to get ivermectin. He couldn't find a doctor willing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=158.72s)]
*  to prescribe it. He ended up in the hospital. And he went downhill like so many people did. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=163.76s)]
*  And his wife, the hospital was talking hospice. They were giving up. They said, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  we tried everything. Come on. How old was this man? He was late 50s, early 60s. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  Not elderly? No. And he was a big guy, but he had no comorbidities. He had no other medical problems. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=184.48s)]
*  And so, we saw this, though, with so many people. Day, if you didn't get early treatment, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  the second week of illness, people would start really getting bad. This massive inflammatory [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  response would kick in. It almost always happened on day eight. It was very weird. It was very [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=206.8s)]
*  predictable. And the primary care doctors just shut their doors to these people. They said, oh, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=212.0s)]
*  this is just a virus. We'll let it run its course and then go to the emergency room if you can't [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=219.68s)]
*  breathe. So that happened. Can I ask you, why would primary care physicians, whose duty it is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=224.64s)]
*  to treat patients, and they must have known by this point that day eight is the critical day, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=231.12s)]
*  why would they not treat these people? Because there's a dogma that we are taught in medical [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  school and in our training that you don't treat a virus, that you let a virus run its course. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=240.56s)]
*  Because there's this big fear about antibiotic resistance. So they don't want people over [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=246.48s)]
*  prescribing antibiotics. And so, the assumption, if somebody comes to you with an upper respiratory [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=250.72s)]
*  tract infection in the first three, four days, five days, and they don't test positive for strep, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  you basically say, oh, you've got a virus, and we'll just wait and see what happens. Well, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=262.64s)]
*  I mean, that was just catastrophic. I mean, that was really, and I learned so much. I mean, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=266.88s)]
*  I had that mindset prior to the pandemic. But it just didn't sit well with me when people were [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=271.92s)]
*  coming in and really struggling to just do nothing. And so, initially, I tried hydroxychloroquine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  But as soon as President Trump came out and said how great it was, the Texas State Board of Pharmacy, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=285.92s)]
*  they literally shut it down. They prohibited doctors from prescribing hydroxychloroquine. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  So I put it on the back burner, and I just did my best. I did breathing treatments, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=296.8s)]
*  steroids. I did antibiotics for secondary infection. But initially, I didn't really [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=301.6s)]
*  have a lot of demand for people coming in needing treatment. I was doing a lot of testing, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  and that sort of got me recognized in town because I had a saliva test that didn't require a swab up [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=313.36s)]
*  the nose, and I was able to get the results back very quickly. You might remember, initially, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=321.36s)]
*  LabCorp was the only lab in the country that had the test, and they became inundated, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=326.4s)]
*  and it was taking two weeks to get the test results back. So we had a saliva test, and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=331.67999999999995s)]
*  people could just, we could just give a cup, and they could sit in their car and spit in it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  And then we'd have the results back the next day. So that's where it all started. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=342.08s)]
*  And then monoclonal antibodies came about, and those worked great. I mean, I could get as many [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=348.08s)]
*  doses as I wanted. I'd get them the next day. I'd just contact the manufacturer, say, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=354.8s)]
*  I need 200 doses. They'd be at my doorstep. Great. They worked wonderfully. People turned around very [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  quickly. But what happened is, and this is during that big surge, when Jason Jones, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=366.08s)]
*  a sheriff's deputy, got sick, couldn't get monoclonal antibodies, couldn't get ivermectin. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=373.36s)]
*  When in 2001 was that? Do you remember? So the summer of 2021. Well, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=377.68s)]
*  we'll start in the spring of 2021. So this is following the rollout of the COVID shots. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  The government is upset because people are not buying it. People are not getting, there's very [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=389.36s)]
*  low uptake, very low interest or suspicion of these shots. So in March, they started their PR [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=394.8s)]
*  campaign, the government. They went after ivermectin. The FDA put something on their website [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=402.16s)]
*  about, you can't use ivermectin for COVID, that Biden doled out $11.5 billion to groups around the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=407.52s)]
*  country. Initially, it started with $275,000. It went up to $17,000. Influencers, church groups, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=419.76s)]
*  sports leagues, all sorts of people, just funneling out taxpayer money to go after doctors like myself [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=426.32s)]
*  that were spreading misinformation and to push people to get these COVID shots. So that happened [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=433.36s)]
*  in the spring. So Houston Methodist Hospital, and that's where I had privileges, they were the first [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  hospital in the country to mandate the shots. And this was April 1st, 2021. And this was the exact [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=450.0s)]
*  day that Biden announced COVID-19 Community Corps, that billion, multi-billion dollar [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=456.72s)]
*  propaganda effort. I think it was very purposeful. I think the mandate started in Houston for a reason. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that they knew if they could get away with the mandates in Texas, they could get away [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=469.44000000000005s)]
*  with them anywhere. Where was your governor in this? He was, you know, he, he, yeah, a Republican [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=473.36s)]
*  governor. Yeah, he was, he was a little slow to act. I mean, he, he was on board with Methodist. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=480.64s)]
*  In fact, I have the CEO of Methodist, Dr. Mark Boone, on camera saying that Governor Abbott [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=487.68s)]
*  wanted them to get a shot in every arm. That's, that's according to the CEO of Methodist. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=493.68s)]
*  But, you know, he did, he did come through eventually, but this is early on. So then that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  summer started having all these breakthrough cases. And I was seeing it because I was testing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=506.56s)]
*  people. So I started to track people by their vaccination status. And I saw that the vaccinated [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=511.6s)]
*  outnumbered the unvaccinated and they were just as sick, if not sicker. So I brought this to the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=518.16s)]
*  attention of Houston Methodist. Were these your patients you're talking about? People that were [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=523.84s)]
*  coming to my office to get tested. And- Why wasn't every doctor doing this? Well, we can get to that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=527.36s)]
*  because I mean, I'm independent. So it allowed me to do things that other doctors can't do. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=534.8s)]
*  But I was actually collaborating with Methodist. I was sharing my data with them because I had so [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=540.64s)]
*  many, I mean, basically I was just, all I saw was COVID for a few years. And we were trying to get [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=544.7199999999999s)]
*  the data published. So we had a good relationship. So I reached out and I said, Hey, are you seeing [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=550.64s)]
*  what I'm seeing? Like these, all these breakthrough cases. At the same time, I had all these people [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=554.64s)]
*  coming to me very distraught about the mandates. And, you know, because we were ahead of the time, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=560.24s)]
*  right? This was before the rest of the country was mandating the shots. But in Houston, if you, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=566.32s)]
*  a lot of people at Houston Methodist, they employ about 30,000 people. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=572.24s)]
*  Very distraught over these mandates. And then I see that they're not working. At that time, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=577.36s)]
*  I wasn't seeing the injuries. And at that time, I was just very vocal against the mandates. So [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=582.8s)]
*  I, you know, then we'll, in August, late August of 2021, FDA put out the infamous horse tweet. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=590.72s)]
*  And that's the attractive healthcare worker nuzzling the horse and says, seriously, y'all, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  you're not a horse. You're not a cow. Stop it. Tweet went viral. That's right. That's when Joe [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=605.92s)]
*  Rogan got smeared for taking ivermectin. And then right after that, Biden mandated the shots and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=611.52s)]
*  they took away monoclonal antibodies. So it was all very orchestrated. But monoclonal antibodies, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=619.04s)]
*  I've never heard anybody say that they weren't helpful. Right. But if you have monoclonal [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  antibodies available as an option, people are going to do that rather than get the shot. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=631.52s)]
*  So that's why, in my opinion, that's why they took away the monoclonal antibodies. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=635.68s)]
*  Which were working. They worked great. I mean, it was. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  So this is like the most evil thing that's ever happened in the United States. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, in my opinion, definitely. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=645.76s)]
*  I'm sorry to keep interjecting. It's just, even though I live this, it's just so stunning to hear [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=648.88s)]
*  it recounted as crisply as you are recounting it. So, okay, so they take away monoclonal antibodies. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=654.4000000000001s)]
*  They mandate the shot. You're sharing your data with the hospital at which you have privileges. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=662.96s)]
*  What are they saying? So their response was one sentence. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=668.96s)]
*  And it said, well, we think the shots are there to lessen the severity. Well, interestingly enough, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=673.44s)]
*  they've never shared their data, their hospital data. And being the first in the country to [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=681.36s)]
*  mandate the shots, you know they're sitting on an enormous amount of data. And if the shots had been [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=686.24s)]
*  effective in preventing transmission or lowering the severity, then they should have shared that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=692.64s)]
*  They would have shared that. They would have been screaming that from the rooftops. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=700.4s)]
*  It fits their agenda, but they've been very quiet about that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=703.68s)]
*  So, you know, I had, you know, all these things, all these patients coming to me, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=708.56s)]
*  very distraught. I had one patient come to me and tell me that her urologist at Houston Methodist [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=713.12s)]
*  called her and said, you're going to need to find a new urologist if you don't get the COVID shots. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=719.92s)]
*  And she had a history of bladder cancer. So she was very upset and she was calling me to try to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=725.84s)]
*  find a new doctor. The urologist said, I won't treat you? Well, he said that the department was [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=730.48s)]
*  talking, having discussions about not treating patients that were unvaccinated. He didn't say- [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=735.84s)]
*  The Texas Health Department? No, this is at Houston Methodist Hospital. Oh, the Department of Urology. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes. That's what he told this patient. Then- Doesn't he have a moral obligation to treat [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=747.84s)]
*  his patients? Yeah. Well, we saw all sorts of moral issues during the pandemic. Crimes. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=754.96s)]
*  I mean, yeah, crimes. So, yeah, that happened. And then on the exact same day, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=760.88s)]
*  I got a notice from a surgery center where I operate that I'd have to get the COVID shot [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=768.72s)]
*  to continue operating. And then on the same day, I got a notice from this hospital where I was [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  trying to help the sheriff's deputy. They had a court order to give me emergency temporary privileges [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=781.44s)]
*  so that I could give him ivermectin. The wife sued and she was last-ditch effort, let a dying man [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  try ivermectin before- The sheriff's deputy father of six. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=794.96s)]
*  Yes. I testified. She asked me to testify. I testified. Senator Bob Hall testified. We won. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=797.7600000000001s)]
*  And the court was ordered to give me emergency temporary privileges. And then I was to either [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=806.32s)]
*  myself personally give the ivermectin to him or have a nurse do it because they thought it was [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=813.12s)]
*  too dangerous for one of their own members to do it. To treat a patient. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=818.96s)]
*  Yeah, with ivermectin, which is insane. Anyway, I got a notice that they were going to deny my [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=823.44s)]
*  privileges. Even though I've never been sued for malpractice, spotless record. They made me get [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=831.12s)]
*  letters of recommendation. They made me submit my surgical case logs. They just fought tooth and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=838.24s)]
*  nail to make the whole process as difficult as they could. And the lawyers ended up having to go [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=844.24s)]
*  back to the judge and fight with them over just giving me privileges. Whereas at that time, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=850.88s)]
*  there was a shortage. They needed doctors to work in the hospitals. And if I, under other [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=857.68s)]
*  circumstances, if I had just shown up and said, hey, I want to help out in the ICU, they would have [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=862.56s)]
*  granted me privileges the same day. There wouldn't have been any kind of letters of recommendation or [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=867.68s)]
*  surgery anyway. Can I just ask, were you pretty confident this man was going to die without [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=873.3599999999999s)]
*  treatment? No. So this is interesting. So the lawyers that were doing this case, Ralph Loriggo [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=878.9599999999999s)]
*  and Beth Parlato, they did 189 cases around the country. Similar situation. The spouse is suing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=887.12s)]
*  the hospital to try to get their loved one, Ivermectin, in this last ditch effort to save [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=895.76s)]
*  their lives. Half of those people, they won the case. And in the cases where they won, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=900.8s)]
*  all but three patients died. In the cases where they lost, all the patients died. I mean, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=907.44s)]
*  it's really amazing. And apparently, the judges, their political party matched the outcome of the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=913.36s)]
*  trial. So the Republican judges were the ones that ruled in favor of the plaintiff. And then [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  the Democrat judges were the ones that ruled against the plaintiff. You're making my heart beat fast [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=924.88s)]
*  hearing this. So what happened in this specific case? So, you know, there was a lot of back and [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  forth. It was very confusing. It was happening very quickly. And his life is on the line. And [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=938.64s)]
*  they basically, the lawyers told me, you have the green light. We're going to go ahead. We can go. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=948.08s)]
*  It's all good. Everything's cleared. So I send the nurse to the hospital. And she's greeted by the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=954.56s)]
*  police and the hospital administrator and turned away. And he never is allowed to get the Ivermectin [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=960.24s)]
*  and they appealed and were managing to get a stay on the order. And then on appeal, they lost. So the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=968.64s)]
*  wife, luckily, she was able to go into the hospital every day, which was unusual. Most spouses didn't [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  get to do that. But that was one good thing. And this was at Texas Hugely Hospital in Fort Worth. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=985.76s)]
*  So she applied Ivermectin to him topically every day without the hospital knowing. The hospital [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=992.3199999999999s)]
*  tied up his feeding tube because they didn't want her sneaking anything in. They put towels and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=998.24s)]
*  rubber bands around it so that nothing could be snuck in. These people are evil. Yeah. And I mean, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1002.96s)]
*  they fought tooth and nail to keep him from just trying a very safe medication, which I believe [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1008.64s)]
*  should be over the counter. And then they turned me into the medical board over it. And I'm still [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1014.88s)]
*  fighting those charges. The patient, he did survive, but he spent six months in the hospital. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1021.68s)]
*  He lost half of his body weight. He never was able to make a full recovery. And then unfortunately, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1028.56s)]
*  he did pass away. That's like, that's a, that's very upsetting to hear that. That's very upsetting. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1033.84s)]
*  And so the charges against you, boy, I thought I was done being upset by COVID. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1044.56s)]
*  You just brought me back. It's such a stain on this country. It's a stain on the medical profession. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1049.68s)]
*  And just that people didn't storm the hospitals. Your father, your husband, your children dying [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1057.92s)]
*  alone. You should have showed up with guns and said, get out of my way. That's my loved one. And [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be with him when he dies. Exactly. And so I, you know, people should have done that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1070.5600000000002s)]
*  And I hope they will next time. Excuse me. So your crime is recommending a therapy for COVID. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1076.08s)]
*  That's your crime? Or is there, I mean, I'm missing something? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1083.52s)]
*  Well, the technicality is that I didn't have hospital privileges when I sent the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1085.52s)]
*  nurse to the hospital. But because this was a legal dispute. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1090.4s)]
*  She never got in. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1094.4s)]
*  She never got in. And I was following the guidance of the lawyers. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1095.44s)]
*  So your nurse made it to the threshold of a hospital, therefore you should lose your medical [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1099.2s)]
*  license. Well, I don't think they're trying to, I think they just want to find me and- [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1102.4s)]
*  Find you? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1107.52s)]
*  Yeah. Mark my record. And I could have settled a long time ago. So you have something called [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1108.16s)]
*  an informal settlement conference. It's behind closed doors. There's no witnesses or you don't [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1114.24s)]
*  really get to interact much. And they offered to make it go away if I paid them $5,000 and took [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1120.88s)]
*  eight hours of CME and retook the continuing medical education. And then retook the jurisprudence [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1127.84s)]
*  exam. So all doctors in Texas have to take a medical legal exam, which I've already taken [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1137.04s)]
*  and passed, but they wanted me to take it again. And I just said, no, I'm not caving to this. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1142.72s)]
*  And unfortunately, the latest, so it's been three and a half years, there have been multiple [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1149.04s)]
*  continuances. They haven't been able to find an expert witness to testify against me. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1153.6s)]
*  The first one got sick with cancer. The second one just, I think just chickened out. I don't know. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1159.04s)]
*  And then the third one, the third witness, it turns out that the entire time, and he was the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1166.32s)]
*  former medical director of the Texas Medical Board, the entire time, the last 12 years, he's been [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1173.04s)]
*  working for Planned Parenthood. So we found that out. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1178.24s)]
*  Wait, wait. What? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1181.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1182.72s)]
*  Wait, what? I'm so sorry. Now I'm tuning in with greater intensity. What is his job, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  his day job when he's not? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1188.32s)]
*  He's a lab director for Planned Parenthood. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1190.16s)]
*  What is a lab director at Planned Parenthood? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1193.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1195.6000000000001s)]
*  Sell fetal tissue to vaccine companies? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1196.72s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1198.96s)]
*  Yeah. And he's on the medical board? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1200.16s)]
*  He was the medical director of the medical board. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1205.2s)]
*  And he works at Planned Parenthood? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1209.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1211.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1212.0s)]
*  This is not Vermont. This is Texas. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  Exactly. No, I mean, Texas is not what people think. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1215.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I've figured that out. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1218.4s)]
*  Man, I didn't expect to be left speechless the first 10 minutes. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1223.68s)]
*  Only three things are absolutely certain in this life. And you know, two of them, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1227.76s)]
*  first is death, second is taxes. And the third, unfortunately, is getting ripped off by your cell [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1230.96s)]
*  phone company. If you're a Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile customer, you know exactly what we're [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1234.88s)]
*  talking about. But there is an option. You could save a ton every month by switching [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1240.48s)]
*  to the service that we use. It's called PureTalk. PureTalk is an earnest friend of the show, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1245.28s)]
*  and they are the answer. If you become a customer of PureTalk, you get unlimited text, talk, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1250.16s)]
*  and five gigs of data, which is enough for most people, on the country's most dependable 5G [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1257.6s)]
*  network. And here's the punchline. It costs $25 a month. So the average family of four we did the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1262.16s)]
*  math saves over $1,000 a year when they switch to PureTalk. $1,000 a year. Plus, it's a great [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1267.76s)]

*  out of this? This is just like a med school classmate is going through what you're going [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1298.32s)]
*  through. Do you see any other side to the argument? Any potentially legitimate justification for [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1301.52s)]
*  hounding you for four years? You know, the medical board's job is to protect the public [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1307.76s)]
*  from dangerous doctors. I mean, it's true, though. I mean, there are you get a monthly bulletin and [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1313.84s)]
*  there are, you know, sex- Like the ones who give your kids amphetamines for ADHD? Well, yeah. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1320.72s)]
*  The ones who hook your wife on benzodiazepines because she has panic attacks? Those doctors? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1325.76s)]
*  Right, right. Well, no. No, not those doctors. Oh, different doctors. Okay. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1330.32s)]
*  I mean, we get a monthly email just blasting all the crimes that doctors have done. And it's pretty [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1335.9199999999998s)]
*  bad. I mean, you know, sex offenders. I'm not surprised even a little bit. A lot of, you know, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1341.44s)]
*  so that's their role. I don't think I'm dangerous. I was trying to save a life. I stepped on the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1347.28s)]
*  toes of a hospital. That was my crime. A multi-billion dollar hospital, Advent hospital. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1352.8s)]
*  And, you know, that's what happened with Methodist. I stepped on their toes and they just weren't going [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1360.0800000000002s)]
*  to have that. So at any point during this, can you go to the- I mean, these are obviously huge [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1363.76s)]
*  corporations, but they're institutions whose goal is to save lives, improve lives, bring health [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1370.24s)]
*  to the population. Could you ever just call the CEO of the hospital and the medical director of [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1376.4s)]
*  the hospital and say, this is really crazy. Like, I'm not profiting from this. I have remectin. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1382.56s)]
*  There's no profit margin in it, right? I just think this therapy works. I've seen it and I'm [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1387.6s)]
*  going to try and help. And why don't you back off? Yeah. Can you do that? I mean, at the time that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1391.84s)]
*  this was going down, it was a legal battle. I felt like, well, I really can't, I just have to, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1396.4s)]
*  yeah, I can't step outside what the lawyers are telling me to do. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1402.88s)]
*  How much money do these hospitals take from the Biden administration? Do you know? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1407.2s)]
*  I don't know for sure, but I know that Houston Methodist Hospital has [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1410.88s)]
*  $13 billion in assets. That was actually a couple of years ago. It's probably more now. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1415.2s)]
*  In assets? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1420.64s)]
*  In assets. So $13 billion in assets. And they have locations all over Houston. They don't pay [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1422.24s)]
*  property taxes. They're nonprofit. They don't pay property taxes? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1430.56s)]
*  They don't pay any property taxes. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1435.04s)]
*  Do you think we should get rid of nonprofit status period? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1436.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1438.96s)]
*  Don't understand. I've met almost no nonprofit that I think is good. And that needs to be reformed. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1439.36s)]
*  We could probably close the deficit despite having these people pay the taxes that the rest of us pay. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1450.0s)]
*  Wow, that's just so shocking. Was there any hospital in Houston where you live, I think, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1457.2s)]
*  that was willing to be reasonable or was not taking orders? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1462.32s)]
*  Yes, there was. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1465.68s)]
*  Good. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1467.04s)]
*  Yes. So there was a Dr. Joe Varone, who is a pulmonologist, critical care doctor. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1467.28s)]
*  He's now the head of Independent Medical Alliance. He and I, I would have, it was crazy. We'd have [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1473.28s)]
*  patients calling us all over the country saying, help, get me out of this hospital. And he would [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1480.32s)]
*  accept transfers from all over the country. So people would be, you know, life flighted from [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1486.56s)]
*  ICU in Maine and taken down to Houston. And he would care for them. And this hospital, UMMC, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  allowed him to use ivermectin. And we were, so there was a whole protocol that was, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1500.0s)]
*  it's called the Math Plus Protocol, and started by FLCCC, which now is Independent Medical Alliance. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1506.7199999999998s)]
*  But it was high dose steroids. It was high dose ivermectin. It was high dose vitamin C. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1514.56s)]
*  It was breathing treatments. It was all these very basic, you know, not dangerous things [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1520.9599999999998s)]
*  that weren't being done. He saved a lot of lives. He worked crazy. I mean, I think he worked over [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1526.3200000000002s)]
*  two and a half years straight without even a break. But I was fortunate to have him as an ally and [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1531.8400000000001s)]
*  somebody that- What a man. Good for him. So do you're clearly a data person. Do we have, like, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1538.16s)]
*  the final outcome? Like, how did those patients do versus patients who were, like, intubated in [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1544.72s)]
*  some Biden controlled hospital? Well, if you look at, there's a great website that compiles all the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1549.6000000000001s)]
*  ivermectin data just by itself. And we have 105 studies showing the efficacy of ivermectin. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1555.76s)]
*  And it, you know, it varied depending on the actual patient as it should. And you wouldn't [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1564.16s)]
*  always just use ivermectin. So, you know, in my more severe patients, I would use a combination [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1572.56s)]
*  of ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin. During that second week, I would do higher dose [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1578.16s)]
*  steroids if necessary. I would do breathing treatments. So it's hard to isolate saying, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1584.64s)]
*  okay, well, it's just ivermectin. But when you look on this compilation of studies, I mean, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1589.2800000000002s)]
*  even in the late stages, and you were asking me about this earlier, even in the late stages, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1594.8000000000002s)]
*  they showed that ivermectin could decrease mortality by 40%. It's most effective if you [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1598.72s)]
*  actually take it as prevention. So people taking it twice a week do the best. And then the people [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1605.2s)]
*  start day one or two or three, they're the next best. But- [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1612.64s)]
*  So we, I mean, that's established. We know that. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1617.68s)]
*  Well, it depends on who you ask. But yes, there's plenty of data supporting that. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1620.08s)]
*  So why isn't that like the official CDC protocol for COVID? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1625.68s)]
*  Well, you know, it would help myself and other doctors who, I mean, I'm not the only doctor [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1630.64s)]
*  going through this with the medical board, but if they could make it a countermeasure, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1635.84s)]
*  then it's protected under the PREP Act. And then it makes all these issues that we're having with [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1639.76s)]
*  medical boards essentially go away. Is there anybody who has a counter data [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1645.52s)]
*  numbers showing the opposite, that people taking ivermectin like die more? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1650.56s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't say that they'd say it doesn't work or it's not. But the studies that are all [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1657.28s)]
*  establishment in the big journals, they're either, either they didn't give the ivermectin [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1663.52s)]
*  soon enough or they gave too low of a dose, or the study was sponsored by somebody that has [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  financial interests in seeing it not work. So there are studies countering that. But if you look at, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1678.08s)]
*  there's just an abundance of data showing it works and it's super safe. So I was a little bit nervous [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1686.8s)]
*  before I started using it because of all the media that's only for horses and that sort of thing. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1692.56s)]
*  So I dug into it and I did what- Does it help horses? I know we kept hearing it was a horse [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1699.6s)]
*  dewormer. Is it effective? Yes, I mean, for their parasite issues. But so I looked at the study [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1705.04s)]
*  where Merck submitted to the FDA, it's on their website, anybody can find it and you get toxicity [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1712.96s)]
*  data. And there's something called the LD50, which stands for lethal dose 50. It's a benchmark [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1718.32s)]
*  number that is used to gauge how toxic a medication is. So the higher the number, the lower the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1723.4399999999998s)]
*  toxicity. And in COVID, we were using higher doses of ivermectin than what you use to treat a parasite. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1729.76s)]
*  So I wanted to make sure these higher doses were okay. Well, if you look at the LD50 of ivermectin, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1736.6399999999999s)]
*  it's anywhere from 11 to 82 times what we're giving for COVID. So we were far under that threshold. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1742.24s)]
*  And then I did a literature search and I tried to find accidental intentional overdoses from [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1751.52s)]
*  ivermectin and I couldn't find anything. And I checked recently and there was one study [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1756.16s)]
*  showing some issues and it was a little bit muddy, like was this really ivermectin. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1761.52s)]
*  But if you look at Tylenol, I mean, there's thousands of papers showing toxicity from Tylenol. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1765.76s)]
*  I know someone who has advanced liver disease from it. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1771.52s)]
*  Really? Wow. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1774.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's a thing. Thousands of people die every year. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1775.28s)]
*  So propofol used every day in hospitals. I mean, you screw that up by a tiny bit, you're dead. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1780.16s)]
*  Correct? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1786.08s)]
*  Right. Well, yeah. I haven't seen it, but sure. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1786.64s)]
*  You killed Michael Jackson. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1789.28s)]
*  Yep. Well, that was... [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1790.72s)]
*  Right. But I'm just saying like hospitals work with incredibly dangerous drugs every day. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1791.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1796.16s)]
*  I'm sure you do. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1796.56s)]
*  What are the side effects of it? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1798.96s)]
*  I tell people I have a harder time with antibiotics in terms of side effects. Like if I'm going to get [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1801.3600000000001s)]
*  a call back in my office, it's usually about an antibiotic problem, not ivermectin. But you can [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1805.2s)]
*  get some GI issues, diarrhea, and then you can get blurry vision, but the blurry vision goes away [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1811.28s)]
*  when you stop taking it. And it's not like, oh, I can't read. It's more like, oh, something's a [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1816.72s)]
*  little off. Not, you know. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1822.16s)]
*  That's it? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1824.08s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1824.88s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1825.38s)]
*  So I guess what you're saying without saying it is that there's really no compelling medical [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1826.9s)]
*  reason to call the cops if your nurse shows up with ivermectin. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1831.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1834.66s)]
*  So that's like purely political. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1836.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1838.0200000000002s)]
*  How did your business get your profession get so politicized? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1838.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's awful. I mean... [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1842.5s)]
*  Did you know that before all of this? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1843.7s)]
*  No. And I remember, you know, Methodist came after me very vocally. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1845.22s)]
*  And I had a press conference outside my office as a, you know, I'm not standing, I'm not putting [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1850.1799999999998s)]
*  up with this. And I said, you know, politics has no business in healthcare. And at the time, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1857.9399999999998s)]
*  I really believed it. I was not political at all prior to this. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1863.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1866.82s)]
*  I shied away from, I really didn't like it. And I thought it was too divisive. And here I am. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1867.3s)]
*  No, I think that's such a wonderful and very American. You have children. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1877.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1882.82s)]
*  And that's like a sweet kind of, that's how you should feel. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1883.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1886.26s)]
*  That's how you should feel. I may just want to feel that way. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1886.58s)]
*  Not only people arguing, like, that's great. You know, we have important things to do. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1889.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not making fun of you at all. I love that. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1893.1399999999999s)]
*  But now I feel like there's no other choice. You just have to, you have to get involved. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1895.9399999999998s)]
*  So you were not politically aware at all before this started? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1903.3s)]
*  And were you aware that your business, that medicine was so politicized? Had you noticed it [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1906.02s)]
*  at all? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1910.66s)]
*  No, it's interesting that I went and looked at the data for Texas, because Texas has been [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1911.54s)]
*  infiltrated by people from all over the country. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1916.18s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1918.5s)]
*  33% population. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1920.1s)]
*  It's going to be California. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1921.78s)]
*  Yeah, it is. And you look at healthcare professionals, what they donated, like, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1922.82s)]
*  to political parties. And 10 years ago, they primarily donated to Republicans. And now they [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1930.02s)]
*  primarily donate to Democrats. The whole profession has shifted. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1937.22s)]
*  I have a theory for why, but you're the doctor, so you tell me what you think the cause of that is. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1942.26s)]
*  Well, I think medicine in general, I mean, the corporate practice, it's become the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1948.26s)]
*  corporate practice in medicine. It's become centralized. It's, you know, only 1% of [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1952.74s)]
*  doctors are not employed. I'm one of those, but. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1957.62s)]
*  Not employed. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1960.26s)]
*  So 77% of doctors are employed by a hospital, 20% are employed by private equity or an [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1961.62s)]
*  insurance company, and 2% are employed by the government. And only 1% are like myself. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1971.3799999999999s)]
*  So your choice is, like, your corporate douche overlords, private equity or insurance [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1979.62s)]
*  companies, it's like a joke, or the government. Right. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1987.3s)]
*  And you're in the 1% that has your own business. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1992.82s)]
*  Maybe that's the answer right there. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1997.7s)]
*  Well, I think it is. I mean, we have to, doctors need to regain their power. They've lost all [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=1999.7s)]
*  their power. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2006.34s)]
*  And they have no power. They're just like little worker bees getting ordered around. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2006.98s)]
*  I design, so I, when I got out of residency, I worked in a traditional practice. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2011.06s)]
*  And I started. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2016.82s)]
*  Can you tell us doing what? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2018.1s)]
*  Just ear, nose and throat and sleep medicine. And it was small, but it was easy. And, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2019.2199999999998s)]
*  but I was always bothered by the stranglehold that the insurance companies had over my [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2025.3799999999999s)]
*  ability to treat my patients. So like one easy example is, in your nose and throat doctor, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2030.1s)]
*  we do an endoscopic exam of the nose. It takes about an extra 10 minutes. Not really a big deal. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2034.9799999999998s)]
*  Doesn't sound that fun though for the patient. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2040.4199999999998s)]
*  It's really not bad. You numb it up first with spray. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2042.58s)]
*  There's no shots. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2045.86s)]
*  But if I did that and I, and I marked the code on this sheet, on the receipt, the patient might get [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2048.58s)]
*  some gigantic bill, like $400 for doing this little simple procedure, which as an ENT, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2055.22s)]
*  it's pretty essential as part of our, you know, makes us different from the primary care doctor. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2061.2999999999997s)]
*  We're able to look in there. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2065.8599999999997s)]
*  So it always stressed me out. And then it hit back in my mind, like I'm going to do this. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2068.2599999999998s)]
*  And is the patient going to get some big bill? Right. I hated it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2071.2999999999997s)]
*  So when I, you know, I took time off because I had four boys and five years. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2074.5s)]
*  And I had four boys. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2079.22s)]
*  Yes. And yes. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2081.38s)]
*  What's that like? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2085.2999999999997s)]
*  It was, it was chaotic. Yes. And I wasn't sure I was going to go back. I started off, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2086.42s)]
*  I'm just going to take a year off and that led to seven years off. I wasn't sure I was [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2091.46s)]
*  even going to go back to medicine, but as they got older, yeah, just kept nagging at me. So I [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2095.54s)]
*  decided to go back, but I said I was going to do it on my own terms. So I called myself third party [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2100.82s)]
*  free. I don't contract with insurance companies. I don't contract with hospitals and I don't [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2105.38s)]
*  contract with the government. And the only people I work for are my patients. And it was- [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2110.34s)]
*  So they just like give you a credit card when they come in. That's it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2115.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. But they can, and they can file a receipt, they can file a claim to their insurance company. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2117.6200000000003s)]
*  And yeah, it's very transparent. Everybody knows how much everything costs. And it's actually, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2122.1000000000004s)]
*  yeah, there's so many people that have very high deductible insurance now. They're basically [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2128.82s)]
*  cash patients unless something catastrophic happens. And if you go to a traditional [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2132.6600000000003s)]
*  doctor's practice, half the time they don't even know what to charge you for a cash patient [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2138.34s)]
*  because they're just so entrenched with the insurance industry. But there is a growing [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2142.98s)]
*  movement of doctors like myself and I'm a specialist. So it's a little unusual, but there's [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2147.7000000000003s)]
*  something called direct primary care. And direct primary care is like affordable concierge care. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2152.7400000000002s)]
*  So you're paying cash, but the cost is typical like a gym membership. So it's not super high. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2157.78s)]
*  You get a lot more access to your doctor. You get a lot more time, probably more quality. They're [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2164.7400000000002s)]
*  not always like-minded in terms of COVID. And to me, that's a litmus test for your doctor. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2170.82s)]
*  But it's a better way of doing it. You get much more access, higher quality care, more time. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2177.78s)]
*  And you save your insurance for the catastrophic care. That's what we do for our cars. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2184.58s)]
*  And you use your HSA, so health savings account, if you can get one of those. And the government [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2191.46s)]
*  could expand those and make those more available for people because right now it's sort of limited [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2197.7s)]
*  based on your employer. But if you can pay out of pocket for your basics, then you are likely to [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2202.58s)]
*  have a better experience. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2209.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's in, but it also frees the doctor to think independently. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2211.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2216.3399999999997s)]
*  And to think on behalf of patients. Why didn't you get the COVID shot? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2217.06s)]
*  Almost got it. In my mind, I thought, okay, this thing, I don't think it's going to work, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2224.02s)]
*  but I didn't think it was going to hurt people. I just thought, I just don't think it's going to [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2231.62s)]
*  work. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2234.74s)]
*  Why? Why did you think that? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2234.98s)]
*  Because I trusted. Yeah, I really had never given the FDA, CDC, HHS a thought. They weren't on my [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2236.5s)]
*  radar. I just sort of assumed that everything was fine. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2243.78s)]
*  But because you assumed that, it's interesting that you didn't think the shot would work. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2248.02s)]
*  Right. Well, it's just because of the speed. I thought, well, how are they going to get this [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2253.62s)]
*  together so quickly that it's going to work? I also looked at the study and I looked at how [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2257.54s)]
*  they conducted the study and I didn't like how they did that. So the people, the test subjects [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2263.22s)]
*  were not routinely tested. They were just tested if the doctor felt like they needed to be tested, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2269.9399999999996s)]
*  which seemed a little too muddy to me. So I had a hesitation on that regard too. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2274.5s)]
*  And then I showed up, but I had this looming deadline because I had privileges at Houston [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2281.7s)]
*  Methodist and you had to sign an attestation. And the attestation said that you either got the shot [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2286.4199999999996s)]
*  or you intended to get the shot. So I just woke up on a Saturday morning and I'm like, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2292.1s)]
*  I'll just do it. Let's just get over with. I went to a grocery store and I stood in line [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2297.7s)]
*  where everybody should get their medical care, right? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2304.58s)]
*  Stood in line and line was long and I got impatient and I was like, I'm going to leave. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2311.62s)]
*  I'll come back another time. And I never came back. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2317.2999999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2320.3399999999997s)]
*  Why didn't I go back? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2321.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's just, it's a big deal. You've got privileges at this hospital. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2322.3399999999997s)]
*  You treat patients, but this is part of your business. You're getting paid [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2327.62s)]
*  and you're a doctor. So you kind of have to get the shot. Like we're all on board. Everyone's doing [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2330.98s)]
*  this. And they really were mad at doctors who didn't take it because that's, and nurses, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2335.06s)]
*  because that's such a statement. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2340.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, here's how I justified it in my mind. I never stepped foot in that hospital. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2344.1s)]
*  I had privileges there just as an emergency situation. So it wasn't like, okay, let's say [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2348.9s)]
*  I got COVID because I didn't get the shot. And then I'm going around the hospital, infecting [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2355.54s)]
*  everybody. I wasn't in the hospital. I also knew that early treatment worked. So I knew that, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2359.62s)]
*  you know, this shot was not necessary because I was seen. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2365.94s)]
*  I know, but there's so much pressure on everybody, particularly on physicians at [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2368.82s)]
*  that point to do it. If you don't do it, it's a big hassle. You knew that it was going to be a [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2372.1800000000003s)]
*  hassle. And so just like, I don't know, the tide is moving really briskly in one direction and you [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2376.02s)]
*  decide to swim against it. That's more than just like a casual decision. That's a serious decision. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2382.82s)]
*  And I'm just trying to get to the heart of why you made it. Because you're clearly a thoughtful [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2388.9s)]
*  person. You're a doctor. You don't just do random things one day. It's like, what was it? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2393.14s)]
*  Was it instinct? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2398.82s)]
*  I think it was more, yeah, instinct. And everything was so busy during that time. I mean, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2400.1s)]
*  I couldn't think straight. I mean, we were, it was just slammed. And I just remember thinking, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2406.98s)]
*  oh, I'm just going to go get this over with and just knock this off my list. And then when it [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2412.58s)]
*  didn't happen, I thought, well, this is a sign. You know, I'm not going back. So it may just be [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2416.42s)]
*  instinct. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2425.06s)]
*  Or providence. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2425.54s)]
*  Providence. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2426.98s)]
*  Okay. So, I mean, that decision changed your life, of course, because it puts you on the other side [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2429.7s)]
*  from everyone else. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2436.42s)]
*  How did your patients do with COVID? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2439.06s)]
*  Everybody. So I used to give out my cell phone to everybody, especially the sick ones. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2442.18s)]
*  Everybody that got early treatment survived. I even had some really, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2447.7799999999997s)]
*  really sick people come in, in the second and third week. So second, third week is when the [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2452.58s)]
*  inflammatory cascades set in and people will get really sick. I had a man come in with oxygen [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2457.62s)]
*  saturation in the sixties and he was not a healthy guy. He'd had a history of a heart attack, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2464.5s)]
*  he had a history of throat cancer. He was a veteran and he basically said, I'm not going to [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2469.2999999999997s)]
*  the hospital. Because normally if somebody walked into my office like that, I'd call the ambulance [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2475.22s)]
*  and say, hey, but I had to allow him to potentially die in my office, which was very scary. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2479.7799999999997s)]
*  But, and I had a handful of people like this. He wasn't the only one. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2485.3799999999997s)]
*  So he sounds like he's on the brink. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2488.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. No, he was bad. But I had nurses that could do IVs. So we gave him high dose steroids [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2490.58s)]
*  in the IV. We gave him antibiotics, breathing treatments, high dose IV vitamin C. We gave him [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2498.1s)]
*  high dose ivermectin and we brought him in every day as an outpatient because I didn't have a [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2503.14s)]
*  hospital bed in my office. And he survived. And I had a lot like that. So it was very gratifying. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2508.5s)]
*  I learned a lot. I mean, I learned that just because somebody's oxygen saturation is low, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2515.86s)]
*  they don't need to be immediately put on a ventilator, which is the dogma that we came [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2521.3s)]
*  into the pandemic with. But I think that dogma has changed, or at least I'm not in medicine, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2526.26s)]
*  of course, but for normal people, there is the sense that like, stay away from ventilators. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2530.66s)]
*  Right. I think that's a fair feeling. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2535.86s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I can see why doctors did it. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2539.3s)]
*  Because you have somebody struggling to breathe, that's a really scary, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2543.14s)]
*  distressful feeling for a patient. Yes. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2546.5s)]
*  When you can't get enough oxygen, it's horrible. So I can understand. But I guess what I don't [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2548.66s)]
*  understand is why they didn't do more to keep them off the ventilator. It's bizarre to me. I mean, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2555.06s)]
*  they gave him steroids, but they gave him very small doses of steroids. I mean, why didn't they [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2560.58s)]
*  just throw the kitchen sink at these people? And they just got stuck in these protocols [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2565.14s)]
*  and just basically allowed people to die. We're always looking for cool companies that [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2571.94s)]
*  make products that make you feel better. And that's how we ran into Bond Charge. Bond Charge offers a [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2576.2599999999998s)]

*  Aaron Ross So you said you didn't want to go to the hospital. I live in an obviously tiny world [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2646.98s)]
*  like we all do, but I don't know anybody in my world who wants to go to the hospital. I know a [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2652.8199999999997s)]
*  lot of people who have resolved, I'm never going to the hospital. And they really, you know, I've [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2659.14s)]
*  seen it. Very sick people, I'm not going. What do you think of that attitude? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2663.7s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I realized I've been in the hospital seven times and I know, well, childbirth. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2669.2200000000003s)]
*  Aaron Ross As a physician. Oh, well, childbirth. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2673.78s)]
*  Yeah, as a patient. And one of them, I was really sick. I mean, I had pneumonia and sepsis and I'm [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2675.38s)]
*  very grateful to the people who helped me. And this is from the flu. And I had gotten a flu shot, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2681.06s)]
*  by the way. But now, like you said, I mean, everybody is terrified to go to the hospital. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2687.14s)]
*  And the hospital used to be the place you go. Of course. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2695.62s)]
*  Safe place. That's where you go. Exactly. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2698.02s)]
*  And now people are terrified to get the hospital. And so, you know, our current administration needs, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2700.8199999999997s)]
*  if they don't do anything, that's a big problem because the trust has just been destroyed. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2706.9s)]
*  Aaron Ross Do you see that with your patients? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2713.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's the most common question I get is where should I go if I need to go to the hospital? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2714.66s)]
*  And I don't have a great answer for them. You know, your best bet is just keep yourself healthy. I [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2719.7s)]
*  mean, the biggest thing people can do is keep themselves healthy, manage your diet, manage your [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2724.66s)]
*  stress, get enough sleep, exercise, get enough sun, and just stay out of the hospital. But keeping [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2731.06s)]
*  your weight under control is probably number one. Aaron Ross Is it really? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2738.3399999999997s)]
*  Mm hmm. Aaron Ross [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2741.62s)]
*  Why? Julie Because you gain weight, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2744.1s)]
*  you're more susceptible to infection, you're more susceptible to heart disease, you're more [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2748.02s)]
*  susceptible to cancer. And those are the big three. Aaron Ross [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2752.66s)]
*  And you have to buy new clothes, which is unacceptable. You don't want to buy new clothes. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2755.3799999999997s)]
*  Julie Right. Well, but you know, if you lose weight, you have to put, I've, so I did carnivore for six [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2760.1s)]
*  months. And I had to buy a whole new wardrobe. Aaron Ross [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2765.06s)]
*  I'm speaking as a man. You can't buy new clothes. Julie [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2770.58s)]
*  You can't? Why? Aaron Ross [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2772.42s)]
*  Not a lot. It's against the rules. Julie Oh, oh. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2773.7s)]
*  Aaron Ross Can't buy new clothes. That's what keeps me in line. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2775.46s)]
*  Julie Sorry. Really, it worked that well? Julie [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2778.58s)]
*  I weigh now when I weighed in high school. I never thought I'd get to that point. I did it for six [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2785.54s)]
*  months. And you know, it's not for everybody. But I will say it's a lot safer than Ozempic and [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2789.46s)]
*  Mon Giorno. And it's very simple. I mean, you basically eliminate all carbohydrates from your [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2796.5s)]
*  diet. You just eat meat and fat. Aaron Ross [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2802.42s)]
*  Cheese. Julie [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2805.94s)]
*  Yeah. And you snack on bacon. I mean, it's crazy. And you're like shedding pounds. It's boring, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2806.58s)]
*  but it's simple. You don't count calories. You don't get hungry. I mean, you do go through the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2812.9s)]
*  sugar withdrawal. Sugar is very addictive. Aaron Ross [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2816.5s)]
*  You think? Julie [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2819.3s)]
*  So, but... Aaron Ross [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2820.26s)]
*  What do you think of fasting? Julie [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2821.86s)]
*  Yeah, I tried the intermittent fasting. It did not work for me. I've heard that for women, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2824.42s)]
*  it's not as effective. I worry that it slows down metabolism. But I've never tried it. And I know [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2829.62s)]
*  people swear by it. Aaron Ross [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2836.02s)]
*  So, you don't have a good answer on the hospital question, I noticed. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2839.62s)]
*  Julie Oh, how to fix that? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2842.8199999999997s)]
*  Aaron Ross No! Like, what do you do if you get sick? Your answer was don't get sick. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2845.22s)]
*  Julie Well, if you have to go to the hospital, be prepared. Have somebody with you. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2850.02s)]
*  Have your... There is a patient bill of rights. You have rights in the hospital. Make sure you [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2855.3s)]
*  know those rights. Aaron Ross [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2860.02s)]
*  I haven't noticed them. Julie [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2860.66s)]
*  Yeah, they don't advertise them. Aaron Ross [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2861.62s)]
*  Why do doctors patronize patients? Julie [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2863.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So that's a bit... And it's... Aaron Ross [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2865.3s)]
*  What is that? Treating them like children? Julie [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2867.54s)]
*  Well, when I started 20, 23 years ago, patients didn't have a lot of access to information. Not [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2869.78s)]
*  like they have now. So, we were in charge. We were definitely in charge because we had the [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2877.54s)]
*  information and patients really... Unless they had textbooks, they didn't have it because it [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2883.06s)]
*  wasn't... We didn't have online information. And now, I mean, patients are well informed. And so, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2886.82s)]
*  every conversation I have with a patient, I know that they have been researching and they have a [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2894.74s)]
*  lot of information at their disposal. And I think a lot of doctors don't like that. I embrace it [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2900.9s)]
*  because, I mean, I learn from my patients. And if a patient finds something, I will dig into it [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2906.66s)]
*  because I don't have time to dig into all of everything, right? And you see weird things and [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2912.82s)]
*  I like it. But I think the doctors don't like that. It's a power thing. And I mean, it can be [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2917.54s)]
*  frustrating on the flip side. If you feel like you really know what's going on and you're challenged [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2926.5s)]
*  by something, somebody's read on the internet, that can be frustrating. But it's... Yeah, the [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2931.54s)]
*  doctors just don't... It's a power thing and an ego thing, mostly. That was my suspicion. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2938.42s)]
*  So, what did you end up thinking of the shot, the COVID shot? It's horrible. It needs to be [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2947.62s)]
*  pulled off the market. It should have been pulled off the market a long time ago. I looked at my [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2953.54s)]
*  patients in the two years following the rollout of the COVID shots and 7% of my new patients [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2958.9s)]
*  were coming to see me for severe injuries. I've never seen anything like it with any other product [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2963.62s)]
*  on the market. If this were an antibiotic and you were seeing all these side effects, it would have [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2968.8199999999997s)]
*  been yanked off a long time ago. Normally, the FDA will put a black box warning on a medication if [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2973.46s)]
*  there have been five deaths. They will pull it off the market if there have been 50. Well, according [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2980.74s)]
*  to VAERS, which VAERS is Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, and it's vastly underreported, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2986.66s)]
*  which I have seen firsthand because... But it's been in place for 50 years or something. I mean, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2995.3799999999997s)]
*  it's longitudinal, so we can see the response to all these different medications, right? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=2998.98s)]
*  According to VAERS, there have been 38,000 deaths from these COVID shots. So, under normal [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3004.66s)]
*  circumstances, the FDA would have pulled it. Instead, they've doubled down. They've put the [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3010.18s)]
*  shots on the childhood vaccine schedule. All babies are expected to get three COVID shots [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3015.14s)]
*  by the time they're nine months old. The shots are still under EUA status for this age group. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3022.2599999999998s)]
*  So, under 12, they're not even fully approved by the FDA, and yet they're on the vaccine schedule. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3028.18s)]
*  And according to the CDC, 9 million American children have gotten the latest version of these [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3033.7s)]
*  COVID shots. Actually? Yes. Yes. Still? Yes. Yes. 9 million. 12%. The concern I have with these kids. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3038.58s)]
*  So, we know Meijer Carbine... Wait, this is going on right now? Yes. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3049.62s)]
*  I think we voted against this. Yeah. Correct? I don't know. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3056.18s)]
*  You're very diplomatic. But I'm just stunned to learn that that's happening right now. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3062.1s)]
*  Yep. Could this be shut down? It should have been shut down a long time ago. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3067.54s)]
*  And, you know, what's... 9 million babies have had COVID shots? Yeah. Well, children. Minors. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3073.38s)]
*  Is it compulsory? It's still compulsory in some states. Yes. In some businesses, not in Texas. So, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3085.62s)]
*  Texas actually passed a law outlawing mandates for COVID shots. But I actually reached out to [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3092.58s)]
*  people on Twitter yesterday, and they said... All these people said, yeah, it's still requiring the [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3100.18s)]
*  shots for jobs or a nursing program or even transplants. So, we're going to let you die [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3105.14s)]
*  unless you get the shot. How could we fix that? Well, the shots need to be pulled off the market [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3115.3s)]
*  immediately. Who could do that? Who could do that? The FDA. So, Marty McCarrey. He could do that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3126.1000000000004s)]
*  And then we need accountability. I mean, we need... We can't sweep this under the rug, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3137.0600000000004s)]
*  because we will never restore that trust. And that's the key thing is if nothing happens, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3142.9s)]
*  it's just a festering wound and the trust will never come back. Are there any indications that [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3149.2200000000003s)]
*  this is coming soon? I mean, I'm not privy to conversations in the government. I think you [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3156.1800000000003s)]
*  probably follow this as closely as anybody. There's so much going on. So, I'm going to just plead [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3161.78s)]
*  ignorance on that basis. There's like a lot. Yeah. Multiple wars and the economy and, you know, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3165.94s)]
*  there's just a lot to distract you from this question, but I think it's a really important [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3171.62s)]
*  question, but you are focused on it. Have you seen any sign at all that these products, which [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3175.46s)]
*  according to the self-reporting system, VAERS, have killed 38,000 people that they're going to [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3181.62s)]
*  be pulled off the market? I have not. I mean, it seems to me that HHS, their focus now has shifted [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3185.7s)]
*  or, I don't know, their focus is on food and food quality and improving that. And I haven't heard [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3192.8199999999997s)]
*  a word about COVID or the COVID shots. Really? Not, I mean, maybe I've missed something, but [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3202.98s)]
*  that's, I mean, I'm just reading what you're reading. I mean, I don't- Food is like smoking, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3212.1s)]
*  and I love bad food and I love smoking. I don't smoke anymore, but I loved it. And I'll just say [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3218.02s)]
*  that. I don't hate me for it, but it's just true. That's why people do it, because they love it. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3223.94s)]
*  And I love pizza. I don't think I ever smoked a cigarette. I don't think I've ever eaten a slice [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3227.7s)]
*  of pizza without knowing it was bad for me. Yeah. Exactly. It's common sense. It is common sense. I [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3232.2599999999998s)]
*  mean, I do think like we shouldn't allow food stamps or SNAP to be used for Coca-Cola. Okay, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3237.94s)]
*  obviously there are changes you can make for sure, but like, you know, when you're eating garbage, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3243.06s)]
*  that's why we call it garbage. I'm 55. They called it that in 1975. They'd be like, oh, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3249.14s)]
*  you're junk food. You know what junk food is. It's the delicious stuff. So like, I'm not, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3252.98s)]
*  I mean, I think it's important. I do think eating right is important. And I try, not going to eat [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3260.34s)]
*  any freaking vegetables though, but whatever. But like the COVID stuff, the shot seems like an [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3267.06s)]
*  imminent threat. Yes. And my concern, giving it to babies, because myocarditis- [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3276.34s)]
*  You think that you're positive that's actually happening? Babies are getting this? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3283.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. Oh yeah, definitely. You can find it on the CDC. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3286.18s)]
*  I trust you. It's freaking me out. I didn't know that. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3289.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. That's why we can't let this just go away. Babies. So myocarditis. We know there's an [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3292.66s)]
*  increased risk of myocarditis in teenage boys who take these shots. We don't know what that risk is [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3299.7799999999997s)]
*  for nonverbal babies because the symptom is chest pain. So a baby, the baby could be getting [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3306.5s)]
*  myocarditis and we have no idea. Myocarditis can leave a scar on the heart. And then years later, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3314.34s)]
*  the heart is permanently- Right. You're playing lacrosse and you drop. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3322.02s)]
*  Right. And that's my big concern. These babies could be getting myocarditis and we have no idea. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3326.5s)]
*  Do you believe that those shots are responsible for permanent immune system damage? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3333.14s)]
*  I think, well, what I have been looking at is spike protein antibody levels. So when you get [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3339.86s)]
*  a vaccine, you can traditionally, we call them titers. So like people who get hepatitis B vaccine, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3346.5s)]
*  you can look at the titers, the antibody levels and see if you have protection. We do that in the [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3354.26s)]
*  hospital a lot. So they want to make sure if you work in the hospital, if you get stuck by a needle, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3360.18s)]
*  you're not going to get hepatitis B. So I've started looking at these spike protein antibody [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3364.98s)]
*  levels and it's alarming because the people, I can tell immediately if somebody had the shot. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3369.3s)]
*  In the vaccinated, these antibody levels are, I did an average last night, 13,000. In the [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3375.46s)]
*  unvaccinated, average is a thousand. So there's huge discrepancy. And this is years after the shot? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3382.74s)]
*  Yeah, years after. And these people, most of these people have gotten two, maybe three. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3387.78s)]
*  Nobody's gotten more than that. And none of these people have been sick recently with COVID. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3393.3s)]
*  And so it's very alarming to me. It suggests, I mean, we don't know, but it suggests that spike [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3397.54s)]
*  protein is still active and still replicating possibly in the body. I mean, the mRNA in these [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3404.42s)]
*  shots is not mRNA. It's a synthetic mRNA and it was made to avoid degradation. So it's made to [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3411.86s)]
*  stay in the body. That was the purpose of it, of modifying it. So when I see these levels like this, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3422.02s)]
*  it really concerns me that we have an issue with this ongoing spike protein in the body. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3429.22s)]
*  What are the consequences of that, do you think? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3436.66s)]
*  Well, I think cancer is a big concern. I think immune dysfunction. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3439.62s)]
*  How would that affect cancer? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3444.34s)]
*  Well, the spike protein is oncogenic. Your Shunxing talked about that. So viruses can be [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3446.2599999999998s)]
*  oncogenic. It appears that the spike protein, the mRNA shots have SV40 in it, which is an [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3456.18s)]
*  oncogenic virus. There's something called frame shifting. So when the mRNA is in production, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3463.22s)]
*  is integrating that it can produce new proteins just by little mistakes that happen. So these new [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3472.74s)]
*  proteins, we don't know what they are, but they can cause autoimmune disease and possibly cancer [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3479.9399999999996s)]
*  as well. There's just a lot unknowns. I mean, we need a test to detect spike protein. All we have [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3486.66s)]
*  now is antibody tests. We really need a lot more. We need an antidote. I mean, I am struggling because [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3494.3399999999997s)]
*  I have all these injured people and I usually start with ivermectin. Ivermectin helps. It binds [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3501.54s)]
*  the spike protein and it's anti-inflammatory. But we're really limited and we need a solution. So we [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3507.22s)]
*  need the NIH to really dig into this and help these injured patients because they're very [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3513.14s)]
*  challenging and we're sort of just experimenting because we don't know. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3519.7s)]
*  And they're not helping? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3525.62s)]
*  I would say, I mean, I get, yeah, I've tried a lot of things and the thing that works the best is [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3526.66s)]
*  ivermectin. But it's slow going. I usually put people on for a long period of time before saying, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3532.1s)]
*  okay, this is not going to work. And it's just hard because we need the NIH to step up and help us. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3541.3s)]
*  Time for another TrueLife Alp story. I got a call from a friend of mine yesterday, honestly, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3553.38s)]
*  true story, who said his girlfriend had just broken up with him over Alp. He wouldn't stop. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3557.54s)]
*  And I thought to myself, that's kind of sad. And he said, no, it's not sad. Imagine if I'd married [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3562.9s)]
*  her. Now I know. I was saved. Then the next day, this same friend is driving at twice the speed [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3568.1800000000003s)]
*  limit through a major American city, pulled over by a cop in a speed trap. Cop takes his license [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3575.14s)]
*  registration, goes back to the patrol car, runs him, comes back, looks in the window and sees a [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3579.22s)]
*  tin of Alp on the dashboard, pauses, stunned, says to my friend, you use Alp? Yeah, I do, says my [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3583.06s)]
*  friend. So do I, says the cop. We all do. He looks at my friend thoughtfully and goes, drive safely, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3589.9399999999996s)]
*  sir, and hands back his license and registration. No ticket. So in two days, he's saved from a [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3594.74s)]
*  tragic marriage to a girl who doesn't like Alp and a speeding ticket. All true. It's more than a [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3600.3399999999997s)]
*  ticket to marriage. In an age of 350 million, people are guessing there are about 350 million Alp [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3606.02s)]
*  stories. Email us yours. We want to know and read it on the air. Email tellall at alppouch.com. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3611.94s)]
*  Tellall at alppouch.com. Give us your Alp story. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3619.78s)]
*  So one of the primary platforms we use for distribution is YouTube, which in general has [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3629.38s)]
*  been great, actually, if I'm being honest, a lot less censorship than I got in any television job [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3634.26s)]
*  I ever had. So we're really grateful to YouTube. I never thought I'd say that. But the one area [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3639.6200000000003s)]
*  where we get censored by YouTube is when we talk about the COVID shot. And which I think is really [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3645.0600000000004s)]
*  interesting. So this will probably be censored on YouTube, but I just want to, I just want to ask you, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3651.78s)]
*  but you're a physician, clinical physician, you're treating people, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3657.78s)]
*  thousands of people. And so I feel like I have to ask you this. Tell us about the injuries you are [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3662.7400000000002s)]
*  seeing. So I don't get the sudden, you know, collapse myocarditis, stroke sort of situation, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3668.7400000000002s)]
*  because I'm outpatient. Soccer players. Right. I see the, yeah, it varies, but I've seen some very [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3678.34s)]
*  strange rashes that don't go away with steroids and antihistamines. What kind of like rashes? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3686.02s)]
*  Like bumpy red splotchy. I mean, I had this poor kid, 15 years old, it was all over his face, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3692.34s)]
*  all over his body. And he responded so well to ivermectin. That was a great case. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3698.5s)]
*  So are you sure that was Vax related? Yeah, it came on right. I mean, he had no prior history. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3704.5s)]
*  He's 15. He's 15. It came on right after the COVID shots. I see POTS. So POTS is when the blood [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3710.42s)]
*  pressure drops suddenly or goes up real high suddenly for no clear trigger and your pulse may [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3721.06s)]
*  be erratic as well. That's been a big thing with the COVID patients. That's very difficult to fix. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3729.2200000000003s)]
*  I've seen a lot of neurological. Can I ask what POTS stands for? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3736.1000000000004s)]
*  Postural Orthostatic Hypertemperal Hypertempera... Postural Orthostatic Syncope. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3739.86s)]
*  I don't understand a single word of that. I probably shouldn't have asked you, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3749.1400000000003s)]
*  but like what are its effects? So you feel faint. So you may be standing there and your [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3751.94s)]
*  blood pressure drops or your pulse goes up way high and you feel like you're having a panic attack, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3757.3s)]
*  that sort of thing. So it's symptomatic changes in your blood pressure that occur [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3763.94s)]
*  without any kind of trigger. What? I mean, that sounds like it could be dangerous. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3768.5s)]
*  Yeah. It's very hard to treat. So I see a lot of that. I've seen neurological tremors. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3772.9s)]
*  Oh, come on. Oh yeah. Yeah, no, no. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3781.7s)]
*  Tremors? I saw a patient a little bit older than me, CEO of a company. He came in and he gave me [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3783.7s)]
*  his business card and he said, hi, I'm this so-and-so. And he gave me his other card and he [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3790.5s)]
*  goes, and this is the biggest mistake I've ever made in my life. He gave me his vaccine card. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3795.38s)]
*  Very difficult to... I mean, we've gotten a little bit of improvement, but just, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3800.58s)]
*  in a lot of fatigue... Hand tremors? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3806.1800000000003s)]
*  Whole body, his whole body. No way. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3808.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Even when he sleeps? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3812.7400000000002s)]
*  That's got to affect every part of your life. A lot of these patients say they feel a lot of [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3816.02s)]
*  burning, like pins and needles when they sleep, which is typical of neuropathy. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3819.94s)]
*  That sounds like a life destroyer. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3828.58s)]
*  No, yeah. It's bad. And it's not like giving them an antibiotic and a week later they're better. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3830.18s)]
*  These are chronic conditions. And the government's not helping. So, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3836.18s)]
*  Breanne Dressen of React 19, I don't know if... So, React 19 is an organization started to help the [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3843.46s)]
*  injured with the COVID shots. The head of that organization was involved in the AstraZeneca [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3849.7799999999997s)]
*  trial. So, she volunteered to be a guinea pig and she got injured. Government just came out [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3855.7799999999997s)]
*  and said they're not going to help her. They're not going to give her any kind of financial [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3861.46s)]
*  reimbursement. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3865.22s)]
*  When? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3867.54s)]
*  Maybe a week or two ago. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3869.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't understand. We didn't vote for this at all. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3873.22s)]
*  I mean, the government... Well, in her case, she was part of the clinical trials, you said. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3880.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3884.74s)]
*  But everybody else, not including me and you, took it because we were [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3885.62s)]
*  subject to the biggest propaganda campaign in American history. So, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3892.1s)]
*  we were forced by the government to take it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3896.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3897.94s)]
*  By the way, why aren't the companies paying these people? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3898.44s)]
*  Companies have no liability risk with these products. And the PREP Act even further protects [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3903.7200000000003s)]
*  them. So, it's very hard. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3911.64s)]
*  When was the PREP Act passed? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3912.44s)]
*  It is not... It does not expire until 2029. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3914.76s)]
*  And so, under the PREP Act, they're even more shielded? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3919.96s)]
*  Anything that happened, anything that's designated as a countermeasure is protected. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3923.16s)]
*  So, anything that happens in the hospitals, anything that happens from these shots, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3928.3599999999997s)]
*  it's all protected from liability. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3933.3999999999996s)]
*  There is one really monumental lawsuit going on that could change that. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3938.6s)]
*  Brooke Jackson is a whistleblower for Pfizer, and she was involved in the research. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3945.3999999999996s)]
*  So, she was at the clinical trial sites. She was the manager, and she was seeing all sorts of [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3952.04s)]
*  issues with the way they were conducting the trial. And she brought that to the company's [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3957.32s)]
*  attention. She brought that to the FDA's attention, and she was fired. So, she has been in this [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3963.0s)]
*  gigantic legal battle against Pfizer for a long time now. I think we're going on four years. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3968.92s)]
*  And unfortunately, and this was during Biden, the DOJ stepped in and basically said, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3975.1600000000003s)]
*  no, you can't sue Pfizer. It's crazy. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3982.76s)]
*  You can't sue Pfizer. Of course, you can't sue Pfizer. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3985.48s)]
*  The DOJ stuck up for Pfizer, which is not usually how that works. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3989.0s)]
*  I'm surprised they didn't arrest her for complaining. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3994.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3996.04s)]
*  This has got to be making you pretty radical. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=3998.68s)]
*  It doesn't seem very radical to me. It seems like common sense. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4002.36s)]
*  Yeah. You don't seem like a radical person, but this makes me feel radical. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4005.56s)]
*  So, neurological symptoms, and you're pretty convinced those are also from the shot. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4009.96s)]
*  Well, you look at, okay, what was their past history? Do they have any issues? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4016.2s)]
*  Were they otherwise healthy? And then, when did these things start happening? And the timeline, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4020.36s)]
*  and then the other thing is they typically go to other doctors, and they get the million-dollar [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4026.2s)]
*  workup, and they can't find anything to explain it. And the doctors are baffled. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4032.2s)]
*  They put them on psychiatric medications. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4037.08s)]
*  Not really. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4039.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I saw one patient on a sleeping pill, a benzodiazepine, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4039.96s)]
*  and an antidepressant. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4044.84s)]
*  SSRI? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4046.36s)]
*  Why do we have so many mass shooters in this country? I don't know. It's baffling. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4052.28s)]
*  That's shocking. So, they used to, I mean, in just American culture, they used to make [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4057.2400000000002s)]
*  fun of 19th century medical cures for hysteria. It was always like, the Victorian medical cures, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4063.32s)]
*  and one would have a problem, and they'd be like, here's a giant vibrator, or, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4071.16s)]
*  literally, they made that. They're like, it's all in your head, honey, calm down. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4075.96s)]
*  And that was a trope. And I was hardly a feminist, but I was kind of sympathetic to that. Don't [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4080.2799999999997s)]
*  just dismiss people. Tell them they're hysterical. But that's what you're describing. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4088.44s)]
*  That's what's happening, yes. They don't get reported of errors. I've had to report every [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4094.2s)]
*  single patient that came to see me for an injury. Even though they'd seen multiple other doctors, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4098.6s)]
*  it was me that had to report it to VAERS. So, I know it's underreported. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4104.6s)]
*  VAERS is one of those things. I love the idea of VAERS. And I remember reading the VAERS [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4108.6s)]
*  report in 2021 when I worked in television, and just going on one night and reading it, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4117.64s)]
*  here's what's been reported from this compound that people are being forced to take. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4125.4800000000005s)]
*  And man, I got so attacked by the Atlantic magazine and everybody. It's like, no, this is a [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4130.84s)]
*  federal reporting system. And that was kind of the last I ever heard of VAERS. No one ever mentions [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4136.280000000001s)]
*  it. What's the point of having it if it's irrelevant? Yeah, it's not subtle. If you look on there, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4141.4800000000005s)]
*  you don't have to have a degree in statistics to understand what's going on. I mean, it's like, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4148.04s)]
*  nothing's happening and then whoosh, you know, just it's not subtle. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4152.84s)]
*  Especially since it was in place during the rollout of a bunch of other vaccines. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4156.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4161.16s)]
*  Like going a long way back. So, it's like, you know, measles, rubella, COVID. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4161.72s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4167.400000000001s)]
*  Right? I don't have any degree and I could understand that. So, do you ever hear [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4169.400000000001s)]
*  federal officials make reference to VAERS? Not to my knowledge. I mean, I could have missed that, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4174.92s)]
*  but no. So, the idea with VAERS seems to be that people are complaining again. They need to shut up. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4181.4s)]
*  Apparently. It's one more thing is being swept under the rug. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4187.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. So, you've told a much sadder story than I expected to hear. Are you concerned that [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4192.679999999999s)]
*  because the technology in these shots was, you know, brand new, never deployed before at scale [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4202.679999999999s)]
*  anyway? Is that correct? Right. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4208.68s)]
*  And the, you know, the trials for these drugs were like, I think we can say it's fair to say a joke. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4212.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4217.72s)]
*  That there are consequences that like haven't manifest yet. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4219.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to get up-to-date cancer numbers, but I'm hearing all sorts of things. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4225.16s)]
*  Why is it hard to get up-to-date cancer numbers? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4229.8s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4232.04s)]
*  We're in the middle of a cancer moonshot, doctor. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4233.08s)]
*  Right. There's probably people that have access to that data, but publicly it's hard. And, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4235.32s)]
*  you know, so I have to rely. I don't see a ton of cancer in my practice, but I do have friends at [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4242.28s)]
*  MD Anderson and they said they've never seen anything like it. The young people coming in [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4247.16s)]
*  with very advanced tumors. I think that's what we have to be worried about now. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4253.0s)]
*  Can I ask, you've made reference like five times to numbers and the difficulty in getting numbers. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4258.52s)]
*  I don't understand why, I mean, I understand why the identity of patients is shielded [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4267.240000000001s)]
*  by federal law. That seems reasonable to me for privacy reasons, but, you know, the, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4271.72s)]
*  just the fact that someone has this or that disease with no identifying markers connected, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4277.4800000000005s)]
*  like that seems like it should be public information. How is that not? Why is there [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4283.320000000001s)]
*  so much secrecy around medical data? The data itself? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4287.08s)]
*  It could be, there could be an agenda behind it. It could just be a total inefficiency of [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4291.16s)]
*  the bureaucracy. It's hard to say, but yeah, it'd be nice if we could have more data. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4295.48s)]
*  Well, isn't that essential to science? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4303.72s)]
*  Yeah, it is. But, you know, it's also, I guess it's complicated in some degrees to get it all out [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4307.64s)]
*  there, but yeah, transparency would be, even aside from the cancer numbers, I mean, like I [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4315.88s)]
*  said with COVID, there are all these hospitals that had so much data at their disposal and [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4327.88s)]
*  didn't share it. It'd be nice to see, you know, Houston Methodist come out and share their data [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4332.76s)]
*  with us since they were the first, they led the way with the mandates. It'd be nice to see how [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4338.2s)]
*  successful that effort was for their employees and for their patients. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4344.04s)]
*  Can a lawsuit force that? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4348.2s)]
*  I actually sued them to get that data. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4350.2s)]
*  Man, you are ferocious. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4353.32s)]
*  I lost. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4355.0s)]
*  On what grounds? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4356.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. It was just political grounds, I think. I sued to get their financial data, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4357.56s)]
*  because as a nonprofit, they are supposed to give it to you if somebody from the public wants to know. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4363.4s)]
*  This is what they get in exchange for not paying property taxes. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4371.08s)]
*  Right, right, right. But there was some technicality. I don't understand really why we lost, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4373.48s)]
*  but we did. We even appealed and we lost on appeal. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4380.839999999999s)]
*  Do you think that COVID, clearly there's been no reckoning. You've not been recognized for your [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4386.36s)]
*  bravery and prescience, you called it, and you should be rewarded for that. You haven't been, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4395.0s)]
*  likely never will be. So there's so much about it. The shots are still being given to babies. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4400.36s)]
*  That's my takeaway from this conversation. There's no effort to pull this stuff from the market. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4405.4s)]
*  38,000 deaths later. There's no recourse the average person has. You can't afford to hire [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4413.0s)]
*  lawyers and you can't sue the companies that make these products and you can't sue the government [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4419.32s)]
*  officials that force you to take these products. Everything about it is just pure Orwell. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4422.92s)]
*  So that's the downside and it's like crushing actually to hear all of this from you. I didn't [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4427.4s)]
*  expect to hear this. What are the upsides? Like people are more aware. Do you see medicine in [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4434.28s)]
*  the United States getting better now that people are paying attention know what's up? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4442.679999999999s)]
*  I think people are feeling more empowered, which is how they should be. I mean, they're not listening [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4447.4s)]
*  to the government for their healthcare decisions anymore. I think people have learned from that [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4452.6s)]
*  mistake. And I haven't lost all hope. I'm grateful. There was a time where I couldn't even, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4457.96s)]
*  I was banned from Twitter. I don't know if you were, but we are free speeches coming back. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4468.6s)]
*  I wouldn't. I mean, they couldn't ban me from Twitter, so they didn't. But they could ban [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4474.04s)]
*  much more informed, plus how am I a threat? I'm just some random talk show host with an opinion. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4481.08s)]
*  The people they want to ban are the people who are telling the informed truth, the physicians [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4487.4s)]
*  who are treating thousands of COVID patients. Like you're the threat, not me. You're like, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4493.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm a doctor. I'm a reasonable person. I'm not political. Here's what I'm learning. They have to [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4500.2s)]
*  ban you. Right. Well, and you know, we're making, hey, I'm grateful to you for having me on here. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4503.8s)]
*  Because this is old news to most people. Right. And, you know, we just need to keep speaking out. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4510.68s)]
*  We just need to keep, I mean, my foot is on the pedal, you know, even though there is no [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4516.92s)]
*  pandemic anymore. But we must just keep pounding away at this. What sounds like [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4522.36s)]
*  indications suggest, I mean, I don't, you don't want to overstate anything, but it feels like [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4529.32s)]
*  they're, the consequences are still rippling. And I don't know why there's not an organized effort [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4533.24s)]
*  to find out, you know, our cancer rates spiking. We eliminated cigarette smoking, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4539.48s)]
*  which was supposedly the main driver of cancer. I was there for all that. They beat me into quitting, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4544.04s)]
*  which is fine. You know, smoking is bad. I got it. But like cancer went up. So like at some point, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4549.24s)]
*  I've say, stop. You told me this, the opposite happened. Let's talk about why. Right. Not attacking [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4555.799999999999s)]
*  you, but like I demand an answer. And I don't know why. How hard is that to get some statistician? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4562.12s)]
*  NIH or wherever HHS to tell me what's happening with cancer rates and pediatric cancer rates, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4569.08s)]
*  especially because that's like crazy town. I think, yeah, the money is there for the treatment, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4575.5599999999995s)]
*  not for the cause. Right. So it is, you know, lots of money. It's just going towards [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4581.96s)]
*  that doesn't make any sense. Like how, how can you recommend treatment without knowing its effect? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4588.2s)]
*  You can't make any wise decision without all the facts, as we say. Right? Right. But this is not, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4594.12s)]
*  I mean, this is financially driven. So if you're in it to make money, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4601.08s)]
*  you're going to go after the treatment, not the cause. Very cynical about medical care. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4608.04s)]
*  Investing a lot. Would you have gone into this if you had known? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4616.28s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. I mean- I'm sorry, not to get you to reevaluate your life. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4620.28s)]
*  It's been very difficult, but it's been impactful. And, you know, in some ways I'm glad it happened. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4626.12s)]
*  It's been very educational. And, you know, I have hope that it will change. It may take another [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4634.12s)]
*  generation, but COVID should be the wake up call. And the seeds were there before COVID, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4643.64s)]
*  but COVID brought it all out there. And hopefully, you know, we could actually learn from it [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4651.160000000001s)]
*  and change course. You said you got a flu shot and then you went up in the hospital with [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4658.76s)]
*  pneumonia and sepsis. I'm certain not to laugh at your illness, but, but you got a flu shot. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4664.12s)]
*  I've never had a flu shot because I'm lazy, but you clearly believe, you know, you wouldn't have [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4670.44s)]
*  got it. You're a doctor. You wouldn't have gotten it unless you thought it was efficacious. Right. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4677.24s)]
*  So you got one. Has what you've seen over the past five years changed your view of other vaccine [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4680.12s)]
*  courses? Yeah. I mean, I, what I've realized is I made a lot of assumptions about vaccines. It was, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4686.44s)]
*  you know, the gospel according to vaccines when I was in training, there was no questioning it. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4694.599999999999s)]
*  It was just accepted fact. They were safe and effective. And COVID made me realize, well, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4699.8s)]
*  hold on, maybe let's see how they were tested. And they have not been tested like other products on [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4705.0s)]
*  the market. So they don't have placebo controlled trials. Any of them? No, not like the other [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4709.96s)]
*  products on the market. And they don't have liability protection. So they're, the companies [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4715.32s)]
*  are not motivated. They don't have liability exposure. Yeah, sorry. Yes. So the companies [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4720.04s)]
*  are not motivated. There's no repercussion if something goes wrong and there's no reason for [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4725.0s)]
*  to spend a lot of money to ensure that it's safe. So now, you know, I have questions about all of [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4730.52s)]
*  them. Now I will say I'm not seeing the carnage from flu shot that I've seen with the COVID shot. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4737.08s)]
*  I think there's a different degree of danger there, but it doesn't make me question at all. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4745.48s)]
*  And if you look at the flu shot, in fact, has never been shown to decrease hospitalization or [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4750.68s)]
*  death in people that get the flu shot. And it actually makes you more susceptible to other [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4756.12s)]
*  viruses. And you can treat it. So I had a child who was badly injured by the flu vaccine. Oh, wow. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4761.400000000001s)]
*  And for me, that was one of the drivers in not I mean, I had when it happened was [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4771.56s)]
*  almost 20 years ago, I had no idea that facts I never thought the vaccines could hurt anybody. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4777.88s)]
*  Right. Never even in my mind. I thought they were like one of the great miracles of science. I was [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4783.24s)]
*  so proud that we developed the polio vaccine, which I'm not against, but I didn't know that they had [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4788.76s)]
*  potential downsides. And that's one of the reasons I was like a little slow to want to. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4795.08s)]
*  Right. But anyway, what would you do? So it sounds like you're not like against vaccines, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4799.32s)]
*  but you from what you just said, the system around vaccines does not put patient safety [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4809.0s)]
*  at the forefront of concern. Right. So how would you change that? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4816.679999999999s)]
*  Well, remove their liability protection, require them go through the- [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4821.639999999999s)]
*  Do you have liability protection? Do I? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4824.92s)]
*  Yeah. No, no, I don't. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4826.84s)]
*  Actually, I don't either. You know, we need that. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4829.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it'd be nice. You just can't sue me. I'm such a good person. What I do is so important [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4835.32s)]
*  to the common will that you literally can't sue me. Exactly. That would be great. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4842.68s)]
*  Sorry, excuse me. Yeah. So let me just make them go through the process. Any other product has to [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4847.4s)]
*  go through. It's not very complicated. So that's the first thing you'd do. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4853.24s)]
*  Why isn't that happening? Apparently, when this, it was in 1986 when Reagan put the act in place, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4860.04s)]
*  I guess there were two companies that almost got just decimated financially because of all the [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4869.24s)]
*  kickback, the lawsuits. That should have been a warning sign. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4876.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I obviously hate lawyers. I've never sued anybody. I don't think I ever will. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4879.959999999999s)]
*  I really hate lawyers, quite as much as doctors, but in that range. Okay. So I'm against lawsuits [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4886.44s)]
*  too. I get it. I totally get it. Some of the tort awards are insane and all of that stuff, but [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4893.16s)]
*  I also think it's fair if someone keeps getting sued for the same thing. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4899.48s)]
*  Like if I get a sexual harassment suit for political reasons, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4903.72s)]
*  if I get eight of them. Right. Like maybe I'm groping people. Right. Yeah. That's fair? Yeah, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4909.4s)]
*  that's fair. As an empiricist, you agree with that? Yes, I am on board with that. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4918.68s)]
*  So last question, what are you going to do now that this is all over? Like how are you, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4923.4s)]
*  other than treating patients, how are you as a formerly politically disengaged person spending [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4927.64s)]
*  your time? I try to get away from it all as much as I can. And that's what I would advise anybody, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4932.76s)]
*  is just find something, a hobby that gets you away from things and get outside as much as you can. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4940.280000000001s)]
*  I probably, you know, I'm probably going to slow down my practice a little bit just to give myself [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4947.08s)]
*  some breathing room. And I still have four boys in high school. So, but I will continue to speak out [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4952.76s)]
*  and I may do a podcast. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do, but the fight's not over. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4960.52s)]
*  Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate it. That was great. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4969.72s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising. That's [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4976.92s)]
*  what they do. But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4981.96s)]
*  now. All the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, one the cusp of [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4986.04s)]
*  fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. And that [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4991.32s)]
*  is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's a [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=4997.48s)]
*  waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=5003.72s)]
*  actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that on [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=5008.04s)]
*  YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=5013.32s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=5018.5199999999995s)]
*  actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L28k2FTSENE&t=5024.2s)]
