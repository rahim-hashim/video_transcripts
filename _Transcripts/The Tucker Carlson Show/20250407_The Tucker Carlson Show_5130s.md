# Anson Frericks: Bud Light’s Fall, Zyn’s DEI Agenda, & Why Big Business Hates You
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI)
*  So what happened to Anheuser-Busch? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=0.0s)]
*  Like what is it, if you don't mind, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3.48s)]
*  since you've thought about this probably more [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=6.24s)]
*  than any living person, how exactly did a company, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=7.88s)]
*  an American company like that, that you felt like [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  had a sense of the country that it served, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=15.92s)]
*  go off in a direction that was so obviously crazy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=18.32s)]
*  and self-destructive, like how could that happen? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=22.76s)]
*  ["The Longer Version of What Happened"] [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=26.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Tucker, there's a short story to it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=46.84s)]
*  and there's a long story. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=48.72s)]
*  And then I'll give you the short version [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=49.6s)]
*  and then we can get into the longer version of what happened. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=50.6s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=51.88s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, the short version is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=52.72s)]
*  it was a great American company. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=53.72s)]
*  This was owned by the Bush family. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=55.96s)]
*  The Bush family had started this thing in the 1850s. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=57.2s)]
*  You know, this is the same time you have the Carnegie's, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=59.6s)]
*  the Vanderbilt's, the Rockefellers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=60.92s)]
*  You didn't have any of those folks still in the, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=62.64s)]
*  I know, 20 years ago, but the Bush family [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  is actually still running Anheuser-Busch 12 years ago, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=65.76s)]
*  which is crazy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=67.72s)]
*  I think they actually have houses right around here, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=69.08s)]
*  as a matter of fact. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=70.4s)]
*  I know them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you probably know them well. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=72.06s)]
*  And so the short story is- [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=73.36s)]
*  Very nice people. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=74.2s)]
*  Very nice people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=75.04s)]
*  I'm not everyone in the family, but some of the people- [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=75.86s)]
*  It's a big family. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=77.44s)]
*  One of the former presidents, great man. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=79.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big family. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  So in long story short, I mean, the company got so big [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=82.4s)]
*  and at some point it's owned SeaWorld, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=85.36s)]
*  it owned Bush Gardens, it owned eight helicopters, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  10 private jets, and it got a little bit bloated. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=89.48s)]
*  So it got taken over by this Belgian company, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=90.92s)]
*  European company called InBev. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  InBev came in and bought it in 2008. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  And the culture's really changed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=98.12s)]
*  Whereas Anheuser-Busch was all about growing the brands, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  understood the US consumer, Budweiser, Bud Light, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=101.2s)]
*  all these things, InBev had a different mentality. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=103.28s)]
*  They were much more of a, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=105.5s)]
*  they cut off the world's largest private equity [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=106.44s)]
*  from the happen to sell beer. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=107.68s)]
*  A lot of cost cutting that went on, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=108.68s)]
*  brought a lot of European people into the United States, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=110.28s)]
*  changed the headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=112.92s)]
*  which is almost the geographical center of the country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=115.24s)]
*  And a wonderful town. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=117.36s)]
*  Wonderful town. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=118.32s)]
*  And they moved it to New York City. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=119.16s)]
*  And then when they moved it to New York City- [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  Not a wonderful town. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  Very different town, different mentality. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they had bought [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=125.0s)]
*  a bunch of different beer companies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  After buying Anheuser-Busch, they got a group, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=127.8s)]
*  bought Group Modelo, SCB Miller, took on too much debt. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=129.16s)]
*  All of a sudden the company in 2017- [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=131.88s)]
*  Wait, you're saying a private equity firm [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=133.56s)]
*  took on too much debt? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah, wouldn't be the first time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=136.48s)]
*  So, you know, never happened before, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=137.88s)]
*  Never happened before. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=139.5s)]
*  And I think the bigger problem was is that in 2018-19, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=140.66s)]
*  for a bunch of different reasons, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=144.3s)]
*  the company tried and grow. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=145.62s)]
*  They adopted a lot of the ESG, DEI philosophies [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=146.58s)]
*  that we've heard a lot about. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=149.86s)]
*  Stakeholder capitalism, which is this European concept [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=150.94s)]
*  that businesses are supposed to serve [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=153.62s)]
*  all types of purposes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=154.86s)]
*  That pops up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=156.10000000000002s)]
*  And then two or three years later, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  all of a sudden the company has really changed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  It changed from sort of a great American company [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=159.82s)]
*  based in the Midwest, based off meritocracy values. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=162.5s)]
*  And then all of a sudden in the, you know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=165.46s)]
*  kind of post-COVID, post George Floyd era, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=167.42s)]
*  and as a Bush, they start moving away from being a meritocracy, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=169.74s)]
*  moving more towards diversity, equity, inclusion, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=173.18s)]
*  moving more towards getting more involved [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  in political issues. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, unfortunately with, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=178.38s)]
*  I would have a Dill and Mulvaney in Bud Light, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=179.74s)]
*  that was the product of maybe 10 years of mistakes [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=181.34s)]
*  the company had made. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  And now all of a sudden you have a company [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=184.46s)]
*  that's lost 50% of its sales [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=185.98s)]
*  with the biggest beer in America, Bud Light, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=187.34s)]
*  and they still haven't turned it around. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=189.18s)]
*  So that's the short story. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=191.18s)]
*  Now we can get into the longer story [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  about maybe more broadly what happened. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=192.94s)]
*  Okay, so, I mean, you're describing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=194.54s)]
*  so many American companies, by the way. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  That trajectory downward. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the story, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  there was this revealing moment [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=205.54s)]
*  where Anheuser-Busch executives, or one of them, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=207.42s)]
*  basically just admitted, I hate our consumers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  And you wonder, like, where does that mind, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=214.22s)]
*  I mean, people have all kinds of dumb ideas about business [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=216.06s)]
*  and dumb ideas about everything else, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  but if you're in the retail business, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  if you're selling products to consumers [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=222.22s)]
*  and you find yourself in a place where you're like, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  let's piss them off and humiliate them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  Like, that's so obviously insane. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=229.54s)]
*  Like, how could anybody say something like that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=231.1s)]
*  No, totally insane. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=233.5s)]
*  And I think, let's back up, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=234.33999999999997s)]
*  because, I mean, really, I think this story starts [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  almost 40 years beforehand, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=237.14s)]
*  where you really are starting to talk about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=238.98s)]
*  what is the purpose of a corporation? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=240.42s)]
*  Like, what are businesses in the business of doing? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=242.54s)]
*  And in the United States, in the 1970s, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  you had this sort of this view of Milton Friedman. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=246.98s)]
*  Milton Friedman, famous economist, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  said the purpose of a corporation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=250.1s)]
*  was to serve its shareholders, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=251.42s)]
*  the people who actually owned the business. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=255.26s)]
*  Well, you focus on your customers, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=256.1s)]
*  focus on creating great products and services. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=256.94s)]
*  When you do that, you generate more revenue, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=258.46s)]
*  you can hire more people, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=260.26s)]
*  and business continue to grow [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=261.54s)]
*  and do all the great things businesses do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=262.82s)]
*  There was this other philosophy [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=264.54s)]
*  that was more this European view of the world [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=265.66s)]
*  that says the purpose of a corporation [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=268.02s)]
*  is to serve all stakeholders. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=269.5s)]
*  That was served by Klaus Schwab, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=271.1s)]
*  this is the World Economic Forum, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  Davos type of elite, that over in Europe. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=274.06s)]
*  What's a stakeholder? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=276.42s)]
*  So that's the problem. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=277.7s)]
*  There are thousands of stakeholders. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's almost the idea of like, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=280.66s)]
*  when you have this shareholder capitalism [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=281.82s)]
*  and you have a lot of that, Milton Friedman says, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=283.54s)]
*  you must have like one god. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=284.58s)]
*  The god is the shareholder. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  That's who you have to take a look at. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=286.5s)]
*  But this stakeholder capitalism model, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=288.1s)]
*  you have thousands of gods. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=289.74s)]
*  Those can be activists, government employees, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  they can be suppliers, they can be employees, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=294.46s)]
*  they can be social activism, you name it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=296.62s)]
*  There's thousands of them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=300.1s)]
*  Anyone that touches- [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=301.3s)]
*  People have nothing to do with your company. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=302.14s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the company. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=302.98s)]
*  But you're supposed to be in the business [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=304.58s)]
*  of maximizing value for all so-called stakeholders, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=306.14s)]
*  for the greater good of society. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=309.1s)]
*  Sounds very European socialism. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=310.74s)]
*  And that's effectively what it was. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=312.5s)]
*  And both of these systems, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=314.02s)]
*  they purported to do the same thing 40 years ago. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=315.34s)]
*  They said, we're going to make people more money [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=317.7s)]
*  and lead to better societal outcomes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=320.06s)]
*  Problem is over the last 40 years, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=322.58s)]
*  I mean, if you just take a look [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=323.85999999999996s)]
*  at sort of the US economic model versus Europe [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=324.7s)]
*  since the 1970s, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=327.41999999999996s)]
*  US has trounced Europe on both of those premises. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=328.26s)]
*  If you take a look at our stock market returns in the US, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=331.94s)]
*  take an S&P 500 over the last 40 years, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=334.5s)]
*  we've generated 10% a year on average. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=336.94s)]
*  Europe broad-based indices are like six to 7%. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=338.9s)]
*  But then perspective, you had $100,000 invest in the US [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=341.54s)]
*  in 1970 and 100,000 in Europe, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=344.02s)]
*  and the US would be worth $4.5 million today, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=346.5s)]
*  it'd be worth $1.5 million in Europe. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=348.7s)]
*  So that's a huge difference based on the time [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=350.54s)]
*  they've set the compounding interest of money. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=353.02s)]
*  And then separately, if you take a look at the US, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=354.86s)]
*  Europe might say, okay, well, we didn't make as much money, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=358.5s)]
*  but do we lead to better societal outcomes? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=360.46s)]
*  And I would say, no. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=361.94s)]
*  I mean, if you take a look at the US, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=362.78s)]
*  almost every broad-based prosperity metric, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=363.62s)]
*  GDP growth, per capita income, interest rates, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=365.46s)]
*  unemployment rates, the US trounces Europe on all of those. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=368.74s)]
*  Our poorest countries in the United States [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=371.14s)]
*  are generally wealthier than most of the European countries [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=373.14s)]
*  on a per capita basis. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=375.26s)]
*  And so over the last 40 years, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=377.06s)]
*  you had these two systems that were developing, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=378.78s)]
*  and the US model to me is just the superior model. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=381.02s)]
*  I believe in American exceptionalism, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=383.78s)]
*  I think our American model works. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  The problem is with the American models, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=387.26s)]
*  every once in a while, they're bumps in the system, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  bumps in the road. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  And the last time we had a real economic bump in the road, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=391.82s)]
*  let's call it, was 2008, 2009. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=394.5s)]
*  You had the great financial crisis that happens. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=396.78s)]
*  And after the great financial crisis, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=399.34s)]
*  there's sort of a lot of people that were upset [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=400.9s)]
*  that banks got bailed out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=403.02s)]
*  It seemed like Main Street was the one that sort of, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=404.17999999999995s)]
*  that lost out, people lost houses. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=405.94s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, business and capitalism [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=408.61999999999995s)]
*  kind of has to repair itself and repair its image. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=411.73999999999995s)]
*  And the way that it did that is, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=414.14s)]
*  especially if you remember the Occupy Wall Street movement, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=415.5s)]
*  Occupy Wall Street and everyone else says, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  okay, well, banks and financers and companies, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  they need to be a bigger part of the system [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=422.62s)]
*  in making sure that everybody can succeed. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=424.82s)]
*  At the same time, then you had Obama was the president [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=427.74s)]
*  and he came up with diversity, equity, inclusion mandates [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=430.1s)]
*  that were happening within sort of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  the broader base government. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=434.1s)]
*  And for the next three or four or five years, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=435.46000000000004s)]
*  you see a lot of companies that are trying to repair [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=437.74s)]
*  the image of so-called business and capitalism [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=440.14s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=442.3s)]
*  McKinsey came out with a famous study [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  that says diversity wins, where they said, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=445.86s)]
*  we're gonna have, let's force sort of diversity initiatives [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=448.62s)]
*  on a lot of companies and those ones would do better. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=450.62s)]
*  This study has been thoroughly debunked. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=452.46000000000004s)]
*  You had a lot of asset management companies, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=454.5s)]
*  the Black Rock, State Streets, Vanguard of the world. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=456.66s)]
*  They started really talking more about [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=459.58s)]
*  environmental social governance issues, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=462.74s)]
*  which was a term that was coined in 2005, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=464.42s)]
*  really never went anywhere. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=466.74s)]
*  The United Nations originally coined it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  If the United Nations coined something, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=469.62s)]
*  usually they should be skeptical of it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=470.9s)]
*  Didn't go anywhere for the first five or 10 years. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=473.02s)]
*  But after the Occupy Wall Street movement, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=475.46s)]
*  a lot of big asset managers kind of picked up this term, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=477.26s)]
*  started talking about environmental social governance issues. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=479.7s)]
*  And really a lot of these issues picked up tons of steam [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=482.46s)]
*  when Trump was first elected. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=485.26s)]
*  And when Trump was first elected [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=487.06s)]
*  and he pulled out of these supranational organizations, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=488.62s)]
*  the Paris Climate Accords, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=491.94s)]
*  pulled out of the human rights sort of campaign coalitions. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=493.53999999999996s)]
*  All of a sudden, a lot of these more progressive institutions [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=496.82s)]
*  that said, wait a minute, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=499.62s)]
*  we thought government was gonna solve [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=500.7s)]
*  these existential crises of climate change [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=501.86s)]
*  and banking systems and systemic racism [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  and you kind of name it, now all of a sudden they're not. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=506.82s)]
*  And we need business to do this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=509.18s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of progressive pension funds, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=510.78s)]
*  state of California, state of New York, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=513.78s)]
*  European sovereign wealth funds like Norway and others, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=515.82s)]
*  they have collectively trillions of dollars of assets. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=518.38s)]
*  And they said, okay, now if these, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=521.54s)]
*  a lot of these banks that had all of a sudden [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=523.22s)]
*  started talking more about environmental [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=524.82s)]
*  social governance issues, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=526.14s)]
*  we're gonna manage money on our behalf. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=527.98s)]
*  We wanted them to solve a lot of the existential crises [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=529.62s)]
*  in this country that Trump was not gonna do in 2016. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=533.1800000000001s)]
*  And at that time period, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=536.62s)]
*  you had a really interesting thing that happened. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=537.78s)]
*  You've been with BlackRock? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=540.22s)]
*  The largest asset management company in the world, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=542.26s)]
*  manages about over $10 trillion worth of capital. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=544.74s)]
*  And what was interesting is BlackRock [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=547.38s)]
*  was really one of the leaders of this movement [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=549.18s)]
*  along with State Street, Vanguard, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=550.6999999999999s)]
*  those three largest asset managers in this entire country [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=553.06s)]
*  managed about $20 trillion worth of assets. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=555.26s)]
*  They're the single largest shareholder [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=557.14s)]
*  in 95% of the S&P 500. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=558.3399999999999s)]
*  And they wield a lot of influence [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  in terms of telling companies kind of what to do. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  And the problem with a lot of these big asset managers [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=564.98s)]
*  is that it's not their own money that they're managing. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=567.3399999999999s)]
*  This is like George Soros type money, or Bill Gates, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=572.34s)]
*  it's their own money and they ask companies [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=574.3s)]
*  to do all types of crazy things. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=576.18s)]
*  But the problem was with BlackRock, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=577.66s)]
*  State Street, and Vanguard is they were managing, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=578.86s)]
*  I mean, a lot of times like your money, my money, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=580.42s)]
*  through 401Ks or pension funds or others. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=582.1s)]
*  And because of their largest sort of clients, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=584.86s)]
*  which again, I'm with the Progressive Pension Funds [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=586.94s)]
*  and others, are telling them that they want business [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=588.26s)]
*  to get more involved in politics and social issues, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=590.74s)]
*  then all of a sudden they're starting to force [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=593.14s)]
*  a new agenda on corporations. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=594.9s)]
*  Telling companies that we want you guys [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=597.66s)]
*  to get more involved in environmental, social, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=599.38s)]
*  and governance issues. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=600.94s)]
*  And they even changed the purpose of a corporation [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  in the 2018-2019 time period. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=604.94s)]
*  There was a famous letter that Larry Fink, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=607.5s)]
*  the CEO of BlackRock wrote in 2018, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=609.1800000000001s)]
*  essentially telling companies that we want them [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=611.82s)]
*  to now earn their social license. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=615.0600000000001s)]
*  And you're gonna do that because we have evolved [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=617.26s)]
*  the purpose of a corporation with a group [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=619.7s)]
*  known as the Business Roundtable in the United States [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=621.3000000000001s)]
*  to be more focused on your stakeholders. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=624.14s)]
*  So you're no longer focused on shareholders, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=627.22s)]
*  we want you to focus on stakeholders. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=628.78s)]
*  And that is now who you are now going to focus on [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=630.78s)]
*  for maximizing value without defining again, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=633.18s)]
*  who those stakeholders are. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=635.14s)]
*  And so this becomes very, very problematic [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=636.98s)]
*  in this sort of 2018-2019 timeframe [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=638.86s)]
*  because companies are frankly confused. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=641.18s)]
*  And it set up really a lot of, I'll call it kindling, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=643.22s)]
*  for an event that happened in 2020, which was COVID. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=646.98s)]
*  And all of a sudden companies are being told [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=650.94s)]
*  they need to earn their social license. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=652.94s)]
*  They're being told that now no longer your shareholders, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=654.54s)]
*  you're kind of primary person that you're serving, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=657.14s)]
*  but you're now serving all stakeholders [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=659.0600000000001s)]
*  without defining what that is. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=660.62s)]
*  And in the 2020 time period, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=662.4200000000001s)]
*  now all of a sudden you have this event of COVID. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=664.58s)]
*  And when COVID happens, music is called, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=667.7s)]
*  this is a crazy time period, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  we don't need to go through all of it, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=670.1800000000001s)]
*  but companies frankly lost their sense of direction [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=671.14s)]
*  about who were they serving, what their mission is. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=674.34s)]
*  You remember we all had to flatten the curve [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=676.7s)]
*  and the so-called flatten the curve in early 2020. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=677.98s)]
*  And companies were essentially- [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=680.66s)]
*  Except for the George Floyd rioters [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=682.1800000000001s)]
*  who were under no such obligation, I noticed. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=683.82s)]
*  That's obviously after this. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=687.5400000000001s)]
*  But in March of 2020, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, almost every company lost what its mission was. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=691.94s)]
*  What do I mean by that? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=695.22s)]
*  Well, let's go back to what, at Anheuser-Busch, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=696.1s)]
*  we were making hand sanitizer in 2020 all of a sudden, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=698.98s)]
*  because we needed to flatten this curve [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=702.0600000000001s)]
*  and we were all in this existential crisis of COVID. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=703.74s)]
*  You had Delta Airlines, no longer flying passengers, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=706.46s)]
*  but now flying medical supplies all around. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=708.5s)]
*  You had General Motors, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=710.34s)]
*  which is now making ventilators for the country. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  Walmart setting up COVID testing facilities. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=714.4599999999999s)]
*  So all of these companies all of a sudden were told [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=716.6999999999999s)]
*  to focus on a lot of different initiatives [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=719.14s)]
*  besides just their typical products and services. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=720.62s)]
*  And frankly, like a lot of these efforts, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=722.86s)]
*  like you think about, like the curve was flattened [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=724.3399999999999s)]
*  very quickly, there was no real existential crisis [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=725.8199999999999s)]
*  like we thought there was. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=728.2199999999999s)]
*  But the problem was that since all these companies [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=729.86s)]
*  had kind of been pushed off their mission, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=731.9s)]
*  then we had this next issue, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=733.74s)]
*  which was the George Floyd issue [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=734.8199999999999s)]
*  that pops up in May of 2020. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=736.26s)]
*  And George Floyd dies, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=739.06s)]
*  and now the sudden next existential crisis [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=742.58s)]
*  that every single company in the United States [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=744.6600000000001s)]
*  is looking to solve is systemic racism. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=746.38s)]
*  Because their largest so-called shareholders [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=748.94s)]
*  in the Black Rock State Street's vanguards of the world, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  who had told them that now we want you focused [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=754.38s)]
*  on solving more of these stakeholder and societal issues, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=756.7800000000001s)]
*  we need you to now solve these issues. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=760.34s)]
*  I mean, you went down the list, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=761.98s)]
*  I mean, it was crazy after George Floyd was murdered. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=762.94s)]
*  You had 70 different companies in the United States here, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=765.5400000000001s)]
*  donated over $200 billion [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=768.46s)]
*  to Black Lives Matter in the United States. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=771.0200000000001s)]
*  That's like more than the GDP of Portugal, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=773.5s)]
*  which is crazy in terms of the amount of money [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=775.3399999999999s)]
*  that was donated to these causes. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=776.66s)]
*  And banking donations just wasn't enough. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=778.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, even Zuckerberg and Facebook at the time [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=780.78s)]
*  donated some eight figures, some to it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=782.98s)]
*  But then when that summer Trump had the famous tweet [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=785.54s)]
*  about when the looting starts, the shooting starts, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=787.9s)]
*  then everybody wanted him to now all of a sudden [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=790.42s)]
*  take Trump off of Facebook, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=793.06s)]
*  because it just wasn't enough just to donate, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=794.9s)]
*  you actually had to silence folks as well. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=796.6999999999999s)]
*  And on top of that, in 2020, 2021, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=798.98s)]
*  you had the Black Rocks and States use Vanguard [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=803.62s)]
*  as the world as well. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=805.5400000000001s)]
*  Not only are they, this is where the big problem comes in, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=806.58s)]
*  is because they are controlled, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=809.86s)]
*  the largest percentage of companies in the United States, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=812.0200000000001s)]
*  they have disproportionate power [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=815.34s)]
*  to advocate for policies at companies. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=817.6600000000001s)]
*  And then most importantly, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=820.3800000000001s)]
*  to vote for shareholder proposals at companies, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=821.9000000000001s)]
*  where if you own $25,000 of stock [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=825.58s)]
*  for any company in the United States, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=827.86s)]
*  you can put up what's known as a shareholder proposal, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=829.46s)]
*  that the so-called shareholders of the company, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=831.9000000000001s)]
*  they can vote on. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=835.1s)]
*  And what was crazy is in 2020, 2021, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=836.46s)]
*  you had a lot of these activists [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=840.34s)]
*  that because the purpose of this corporation [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=842.1s)]
*  had changed in the United States, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=844.0200000000001s)]
*  away from shareholder value [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=845.5s)]
*  to this European stakeholder model, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=846.46s)]
*  said, okay, now businesses again, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=848.1800000000001s)]
*  they have to maximize value for me. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=849.62s)]
*  So you saw there's a group called Color of Change, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=850.7800000000001s)]
*  and it's a nonprofit group, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=853.34s)]
*  and their mission is to stamp out [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=857.3s)]
*  systemic racism in the country. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=858.74s)]
*  Okay, fine, you can do that, whatever. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=860.3s)]
*  But they went to Apple, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=862.38s)]
*  they bought $25,000 worth of shares at Apple, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=863.26s)]
*  and they put up this shareholder proposal that said, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=865.86s)]
*  hey, you Apple, we want you guys to do a racial equity audit [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=868.26s)]
*  to figure out how you've contributed to systemic racism [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=871.26s)]
*  and white supremacy in the country. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=874.34s)]
*  And Apple, which is pretty liberal leftist board, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=876.06s)]
*  company, Tim Cook is the CEO and very liberal board, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=878.9399999999999s)]
*  they said, guys, thanks, but no thanks, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=881.8199999999999s)]
*  because Apple's mission is to make magical devices [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=884.06s)]
*  at unbelievable prices. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=887.0999999999999s)]
*  That's what we just do, that's our thing. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=888.14s)]
*  These are important issues, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=890.38s)]
*  but we're gonna recommend against this proposal, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=891.4599999999999s)]
*  because we don't wanna spend tens of millions of dollars [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=894.3s)]
*  hiring Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=896.4599999999999s)]
*  to go and do a racial equity audit. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=898.78s)]
*  But this passed by 52 to 48%, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=900.5799999999999s)]
*  because you had firms like BlackRock, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=904.3399999999999s)]
*  which is the second largest shareholder of the company, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=906.0999999999999s)]
*  voted for it, Vanguard State Street, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=908.14s)]
*  everyone else are voting for these issues, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=910.0999999999999s)]
*  enforcing corporate America to now get involved [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=911.6999999999999s)]
*  in social and political issues. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=914.14s)]
*  And this went the same thing for election integrity law [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=915.54s)]
*  issues that people were asking companies to get involved in, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=917.7s)]
*  defund the police initiatives, help PETA, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=920.3s)]
*  people for the ethical treatment of animals. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=922.42s)]
*  They put up a proposal telling Starbucks, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=923.9s)]
*  we don't use cow milk anymore, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=925.42s)]
*  because we don't think you should use cow milk at Starbucks. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=926.94s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy, all these proposals that popped up [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=929.14s)]
*  in this post sort of COVID George Floyd era, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=931.66s)]
*  and companies were essentially forced [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=935.02s)]
*  by these large asset managers to get involved [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=937.26s)]
*  in a lot of political and social issues. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=939.1s)]
*  So that was sort of the backdrop. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=940.46s)]
*  So can I just give you my theory on this? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=941.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=943.94s)]
*  There's a backdrop to all of this, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=946.0600000000001s)]
*  which is the movement of, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=948.14s)]
*  the economic center of gravity upward in the United States. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=951.62s)]
*  So Obama becomes president 2008, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=954.4200000000001s)]
*  middle class is the majority in the United States. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=957.4200000000001s)]
*  He leaves in 2016, the middle class is no longer [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=960.02s)]
*  the majority for the first time, maybe ever. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=962.4200000000001s)]
*  And at the same time, we've got free money, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=965.82s)]
*  we're down to zero interest rates. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=968.82s)]
*  And that money is being pumped way disproportionately [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=970.4200000000001s)]
*  into a certain sector of the economy, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=972.98s)]
*  the banking sector. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=974.62s)]
*  And so basically most people are getting poor, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=976.22s)]
*  but a small number of people are getting way richer. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=980.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's measurable, I live among them, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=981.82s)]
*  everyone's got a plane now, that was not true in 2008. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=983.5400000000001s)]
*  There's just created a lot of wealth, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=986.7800000000001s)]
*  the Fed created a lot of wealth. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=989.22s)]
*  And so in a certain sense, that's like immoral, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=991.26s)]
*  or it's certainly hard to defend. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=994.94s)]
*  And so rather than defend it, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=996.7800000000001s)]
*  it wasn't the companies that wanted this stuff, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=998.94s)]
*  it was the debt holders, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1000.9000000000001s)]
*  it was the finance people who wanted it, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1001.74s)]
*  because it was a cover for what they were doing, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1003.3s)]
*  which is getting really rich, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1005.1s)]
*  later Fink got super, super rich. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1005.9399999999999s)]
*  A lot of manufacturing concerns, family businesses [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1008.06s)]
*  went under or did not get rich at the same scale. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1011.18s)]
*  And so you just throw out race war, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1014.62s)]
*  hate people because of their whatever, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1018.78s)]
*  immutable characteristics, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1021.22s)]
*  hey, let's throw the trans stuff in there too, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1022.26s)]
*  by the way, we're all gonna die from global warming. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1024.1s)]
*  You basically just freak everybody out, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1025.82s)]
*  throw the entire society off balance [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1028.26s)]
*  so they don't notice the looting. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1029.94s)]
*  I mean, that's essentially, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1031.7s)]
*  I mean, I- That's my view. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1032.82s)]
*  But it is, it's all about, it's control and money. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1034.5s)]
*  I mean, it's control and it's money. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1036.46s)]
*  I mean, you think about- [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1037.86s)]
*  But all these social issues were always a cover [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1038.7s)]
*  for what was actually going on, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1040.8999999999999s)]
*  which is like Larry Fink getting richer. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1042.5s)]
*  Oh, a hundred percent. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1044.06s)]
*  And it's so funny. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1044.8999999999999s)]
*  So when he started talking a lot about ESG, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1045.98s)]
*  environmental social governance in 2018, 2019, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1048.3s)]
*  all of a sudden they started a scoring system. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1050.94s)]
*  It's almost like a social credit system [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1052.62s)]
*  you'd have in China or somewhere else, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1053.8999999999999s)]
*  scoring companies on how little carbon that they use, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1055.22s)]
*  or scoring companies on, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1058.8999999999999s)]
*  did they do gender affirmation care for their employees? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1060.78s)]
*  And these scores were used to essentially, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1063.74s)]
*  pick and choose companies [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1066.26s)]
*  that could be included in indices [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1067.74s)]
*  that Larry Fink and BlackRock and others, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1069.46s)]
*  they could charge investors three to four times [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1071.6599999999999s)]
*  the amount of money for these ESG funds [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1074.02s)]
*  versus the regular funds. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1076.4199999999998s)]
*  And the funny thing was these ESG funds underperformed [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1077.8999999999999s)]
*  their broad-based counterparts. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1080.82s)]
*  So you ended up- Well, of course they did. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1082.1799999999998s)]
*  Made less money, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1083.02s)]
*  and but you were charged more for doing it, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1084.34s)]
*  which is crazy. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1085.9399999999998s)]
*  And it's really funny that- [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1087.98s)]
*  So do you think it would, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1089.3s)]
*  since you've studied this much more than I have, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1090.3s)]
*  do you think it would be a mistake to think [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1091.8600000000001s)]
*  that there was any sincerity behind this? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1094.06s)]
*  Do you think there was ever a moment [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1096.5s)]
*  where Larry Fink or for that matter Tim Cook [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1097.74s)]
*  or anybody at State Street or Vanguard thought, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1099.9s)]
*  we're gonna solve systemic racism [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1102.66s)]
*  by attacking the white working class, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1104.74s)]
*  we're actually gonna solve this problem. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1106.66s)]
*  Do you think they really thought that? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1107.9s)]
*  I mean, there might've been one or two people there, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1109.6200000000001s)]
*  they're just saying, you know, totally other, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1111.3400000000001s)]
*  but no, I mean, I don't really think, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1112.66s)]
*  I think this was all just sort of a money grab [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1114.38s)]
*  and a feel good and being able to go to the right parties [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1116.34s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1118.26s)]
*  That's the way it seems to me, but you know- [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1119.1s)]
*  I mean, it really is, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1120.78s)]
*  because it just doesn't pass any [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1121.62s)]
*  of the first principle test whatsoever. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1122.74s)]
*  And, you know, it's funny that the companies [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1125.94s)]
*  that were the worst, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1128.06s)]
*  I mean, this tend to be more of a New York City, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1129.18s)]
*  you know, kind of a ideology, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1131.54s)]
*  also a European ideology as well. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1133.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, there is some sincerity to it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is funny, you'll appreciate this, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1136.4199999999998s)]
*  because I think where we're going with all of this, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1137.94s)]
*  because you've seen obviously retreat, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1140.34s)]
*  with a lot of companies have backed away [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1141.74s)]
*  from DEI over the last couple of months. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1143.8999999999999s)]
*  There's other companies that are holding on [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1146.6999999999998s)]
*  to some vestige of it, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1147.9799999999998s)]
*  but there's others that are like really all in [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1149.1s)]
*  on diversity and inclusion. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1151.4199999999998s)]
*  I'll give you a- [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1152.26s)]
*  You're gonna love this. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1153.1s)]
*  And the worst of the Europeans, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1154.1399999999999s)]
*  because they really, I think, believe [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1155.34s)]
*  in this sort of European stakeholder capitalism model. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1157.26s)]
*  So you have, I'll give you a plug for Alp right now. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1161.1s)]
*  So if you talk about one of the worst companies [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1164.06s)]
*  that's out there is- [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1166.58s)]
*  America's greatest nicotine pouch. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1167.4199999999998s)]
*  America's lip pillow. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1169.6999999999998s)]
*  But who is your biggest competitor? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1170.74s)]
*  That would be the Zin Corporation. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1174.38s)]
*  Zin, do you know who owns Zin? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1175.8600000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1177.46s)]
*  So it's Philip Morris International. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1178.3s)]
*  They are operationally headquartered in Switzerland. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1180.22s)]
*  On their website to this day, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1183.38s)]
*  and you go on their website today, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1184.46s)]
*  they have a massive diversity, equity, inclusion piece [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1185.3s)]
*  that is on their website. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1188.1000000000001s)]
*  They have that, and I would say it's a, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1189.98s)]
*  I'll call it the worst aspects of DEI, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1192.02s)]
*  which can be quota systems, race-based systems. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1193.78s)]
*  And on their website today, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1197.46s)]
*  they say we're gonna hire 20% of our people. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1198.54s)]
*  We want to be Asian. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1200.94s)]
*  But on their website, just 20%. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1202.22s)]
*  They want 40% women. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1203.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, literally quota systems [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1205.54s)]
*  they have on their website today. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1206.58s)]
*  It should be 100% African, by the way, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1208.98s)]
*  if they're really gonna make a dent, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1210.82s)]
*  but they're racist, so they wouldn't do that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1212.06s)]
*  Yeah, so, I mean, but the other piece is that, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1213.8999999999999s)]
*  on their website, and this is a company [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1215.98s)]
*  that makes Marlboro cigarettes and Zin and other things, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1217.22s)]
*  is, so they are, like, one of their big partners [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1219.98s)]
*  for Pride Month that's coming up is the Stonewall org. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1223.18s)]
*  And Stonewall org is one of these LGBTQ plus organizations, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1226.74s)]
*  and fine, you can be that, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1231.26s)]
*  but they are advocating for biological men [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1232.18s)]
*  to compete against women in sports. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1235.14s)]
*  They're advocating- [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1237.14s)]
*  Wait, Zin is all in on the gay thing? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1237.98s)]
*  I mean, but this is what's crazy, is that, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1239.78s)]
*  and I think this is the problem about where we're going, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1242.26s)]
*  is- [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1244.18s)]
*  What does that have to, keep that out of my mouth. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1245.02s)]
*  I mean, this is like, come on. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1246.46s)]
*  So, but this is the problem of, I think, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1248.22s)]
*  where you're seeing trying to serve multiple masters. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1250.54s)]
*  I'm not making this up. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1252.5s)]
*  You can literally go on their website, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1253.38s)]
*  literally today, and see all of this. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1254.42s)]
*  And I think this is the problem we're seeing, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1255.94s)]
*  is that you have these more, like, European-based companies [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1257.26s)]
*  that I think might sincerely probably believe a lot of this, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1260.02s)]
*  or the European mindset, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1262.98s)]
*  which is very distinct from sort of [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1264.1399999999999s)]
*  the American capitalist model. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1265.42s)]
*  Crippled by war guilt, bent on suicide, yes. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1266.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, at least here in the United States [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1269.42s)]
*  and others, we have a democracy, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1271.62s)]
*  we can throw people out if we don't like them, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1273.06s)]
*  but corporations, I mean, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1275.02s)]
*  they're transnational organizations. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1276.3799999999999s)]
*  They operate against- [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1277.86s)]
*  With an emphasis on the trans. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1278.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, with an emphasis on that. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1279.94s)]
*  But they go across borders, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1282.3s)]
*  and if you are sort of operation philosophically, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1284.1399999999999s)]
*  sort of a European-based company, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1287.06s)]
*  but you have operations in another country, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1289.1399999999999s)]
*  and you're imposing those values in another country, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1291.74s)]
*  I think that's problematic. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1294.3799999999999s)]
*  You probably have no idea where your meat comes from. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1295.6999999999998s)]
*  You probably should know. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1298.1399999999999s)]
*  The likelihood is that the meat you're eating [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1299.54s)]
*  passed through a massive industrial processing plant, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1301.1799999999998s)]
*  probably owned by a foreign corporation. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1304.1799999999998s)]
*  Foreign meat. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1307.2199999999998s)]
*  Did you sign up for that? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1308.2199999999998s)]
*  We don't think you did. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1309.3s)]
*  So you probably have no idea [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1310.98s)]
*  of knowing where the animal grew up, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1313.62s)]
*  what that animal ate, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1314.86s)]
*  or what chemicals Big Food pumped into the animal [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1316.1s)]
*  to increase profits. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1319.1399999999999s)]
*  That's all kept secret, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1320.7399999999998s)]
*  meaning you can never really know [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1321.78s)]
*  what you're putting in your mouth and in your body. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1323.5s)]
*  That's disgusting if you think about it, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1326.82s)]
*  and it's easy to fix. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1328.58s)]
*  Merriweather Farms, a farm owned by friends of ours, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1330.1s)]
*  is a great option. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1332.86s)]
*  We use their meat, we eat their meat for every meal. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1334.34s)]
*  Unlike corporate farmers, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1338.06s)]
*  Merriweather Farms controls the entire thing, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1339.62s)]
*  from the pasture the cattle graze on [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1342.34s)]
*  to the facility where the beef is packaged. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1344.34s)]
*  In Wyoming and across the Mountain West, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1346.6599999999999s)]
*  the cattle are raised without hormones, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1348.5s)]

*  It does feel like one of these, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1373.02s)]
*  like in 10 years we're gonna look back and be like, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1374.5s)]
*  they were major consumer products companies [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1377.6599999999999s)]
*  that felt empowered to talk about your sex life [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1380.02s)]

*  I agree. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1383.54s)]

*  No one hates gays, like stop that. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1387.02s)]
*  Stop that, get out of my face with that stuff. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1388.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care how people dress. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1390.46s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1391.98s)]
*  I'm totally sick of it actually. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1392.82s)]
*  But it's just insane that a nicotine pouch company [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1393.6599999999999s)]
*  would be lecturing me about people's sex lives. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1397.58s)]
*  Stop. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1400.5400000000002s)]
*  I agree and this is the other thing about like, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1401.38s)]
*  authentically, what is a, whatever, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1402.9s)]
*  nicotine pouch, cigarette company, Marlboro, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1406.3400000000001s)]

*  I mean, another thing is Stonewall is like, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1410.6200000000001s)]
*  hey, we wanna do youth sex education for LGBT. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1411.74s)]
*  How about I get my gun when you do that? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1415.46s)]
*  Like stay away from my kids, how's that? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1417.46s)]
*  Again, just stay out. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1419.0600000000002s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1419.9s)]
*  Why any society would put up with it, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1421.18s)]
*  why Zen would pay for it. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1422.74s)]
*  And of course it's not just Philip Morris International, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1424.6200000000001s)]
*  it's like so many of these companies. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1426.3400000000001s)]
*  No, it is. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1427.5s)]
*  And here's the other thing, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1428.3400000000001s)]
*  it's like I don't want Philip Morris to do the other thing. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1429.18s)]
*  I don't want them advocating for the second amendment either. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1430.18s)]
*  It's like your cigarette company, just do that. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1431.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1433.3799999999999s)]
*  Just do that. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1434.22s)]
*  They don't even sell cigarettes well. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1435.06s)]
*  They don't even believe in what they do. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1435.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1437.46s)]
*  So I think what's interesting about where we're going [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1438.3s)]
*  is that you're gonna have sort of these companies, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1441.02s)]
*  you're seeing the same thing with China. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1443.7s)]
*  I mean, why is TikTok being asked to be sold [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1444.62s)]
*  in the United States? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1446.74s)]
*  Well, because it's technically owned by Chinese company [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1447.98s)]
*  and the Chinese values that they're collecting data [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1450.82s)]
*  and information, that's not gonna work [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1452.7s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1454.46s)]
*  So they might need to sell it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1455.7s)]
*  That's not why. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1456.74s)]
*  So. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1457.82s)]
*  So. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1458.6599999999999s)]
*  So they got involved in some, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1459.5s)]
*  they were considered a vector [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1462.1s)]
*  for unapproved foreign policy positions [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1464.34s)]
*  and that's where the Congress did that. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1467.78s)]
*  And they pretended it was about collecting data. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1469.46s)]
*  These are people who are all in on warrantless searches [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1472.06s)]
*  of Americans and spying on Americans. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  And they have no problem [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1479.7s)]
*  with violating your civil liberties at all. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1480.98s)]
*  They don't think you have civil liberties, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1483.02s)]
*  but they were under pressure to ban TikTok [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1484.26s)]
*  because it was considered radicalizing in ways [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1486.7s)]
*  that their donors wouldn't accept. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1489.5800000000002s)]
*  So that's the truth. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1491.38s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1492.42s)]
*  Got it. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1493.26s)]
*  Well, you know, it's. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1494.1000000000001s)]
*  It's never what they say it is. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1494.94s)]
*  Never what they say, but I think the broader pieces though [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1496.78s)]
*  is that whether it's TikTok, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1499.38s)]
*  whether it's Zen in the United States, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1500.6200000000001s)]
*  whether it's, or Anne has a Bush, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1502.22s)]
*  which used to be American owned. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1503.26s)]
*  I think you're gonna have a lot of these companies [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1504.8600000000001s)]
*  need to have choices about what they're gonna make [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1506.26s)]
*  moving forward. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1507.94s)]
*  I think it's gonna be very difficult to operate in the US [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1509.22s)]
*  if the US is leaning more in towards these radical ideas [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1511.78s)]
*  of free speech and religion and open dialogue. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1515.02s)]
*  And those things, whereas we've always kind of been a city [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1518.5s)]
*  on the hill in the United States, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1521.18s)]
*  we've always been this exceptional difference. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1522.14s)]
*  Now more than ever, really. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1523.34s)]
*  Probably now more than ever. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1524.38s)]
*  I mean, we're almost more isolated [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1525.22s)]
*  than probably we've ever been. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1526.18s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1527.18s)]
*  The last four or five years, yes, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1528.02s)]
*  we were going more towards this quasi European socialism, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1528.94s)]
*  government intervention and free speech and everything else. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1532.42s)]
*  And we have now rejected that as a country. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1535.58s)]
*  But I think what's difficult is that, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1538.5s)]
*  yes, we've rejected it politically, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1540.02s)]
*  but again, corporately, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1541.54s)]
*  there's all these tethers from around the world. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1542.6200000000001s)]
*  The effects of globalization over the last 20 years, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1545.02s)]
*  that you have a lot of these companies [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1548.1799999999998s)]
*  that frankly might not hold sort of those same [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1549.74s)]
*  American values. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1551.78s)]
*  Talk Philip Morris, Anheuser-Busch InBev based in Europe. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1553.46s)]
*  In Europe, they have quota systems [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1557.1s)]
*  for how many board members have to look this way [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1558.5s)]
*  or be that way over in Europe. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1560.22s)]
*  And one of the reasons that I think, again, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1561.8999999999999s)]
*  going back to the original question, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1563.58s)]
*  how did this happen in the United States? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1565.34s)]
*  Where Bud Light, the biggest beer brand in the United States, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1566.82s)]
*  how do they have a partnership with Dylan Mulvaney? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1570.02s)]
*  Well, they, I think have a lot of these European type values [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1572.18s)]
*  now, diversity, equity, inclusion. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1574.7800000000002s)]
*  I'm so grateful for that scandal, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1576.42s)]
*  for the effects on the company of that scandal [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1579.3400000000001s)]
*  and for you writing this book because, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1581.5400000000002s)]
*  and for what you just told me, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1583.46s)]
*  because I think most Americans, I'll say of myself, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1584.46s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1587.5800000000002s)]
*  Like, you just use Crest toothpaste, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1588.42s)]
*  you have no idea what they're sending money to. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1590.3000000000002s)]
*  I use Zin for years. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1593.18s)]
*  I finally realized it was a left-wing company. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1594.66s)]
*  I didn't get that at first. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1596.5400000000002s)]
*  But most Americans just don't know [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1597.8600000000001s)]
*  what's happening to their money. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1599.7800000000002s)]
*  And then really, I think the eye-opening moment even for me [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1602.42s)]
*  where how companies have been co-opt is, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1605.9s)]
*  I don't know if you meant to have [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1608.02s)]
*  the Black Rifle Coffee Company cup on your- [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1608.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I love having. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1611.14s)]
*  So, I mean, you'll appreciate this story. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1613.1000000000001s)]
*  And I write about this in my book, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1615.42s)]
*  "'Last Call for Bud Light'," [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1617.3000000000002s)]
*  but one of the opening chapters I have is, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1618.38s)]
*  so I was president of Anheuser-Busch in the US [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1620.5400000000002s)]
*  and I tried to do a distribution agreement [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1622.8600000000001s)]
*  with Black Rifle Coffee Company [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1625.22s)]
*  because a lot of times the same people [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1626.78s)]
*  that were drinking a six pack of Bud Light, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1628.02s)]
*  Budweiser at night, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1629.98s)]
*  were drinking six Black Rifle coffees in the morning. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1631.06s)]
*  And so we were gonna put the Black Rifle Coffee, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1633.6200000000001s)]
*  their kind of 16 ounce drinks, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1636.06s)]
*  on the same trucks that carry Bud and Bud Light [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  to Walnut and Kroger and 7-Eleven. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1639.7s)]
*  And so I had this whole deal [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1641.54s)]
*  and we were gonna make a bunch of money [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1642.5s)]
*  on that great partnership. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1643.3400000000001s)]
*  And our legal team, which was now based in New York City, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1644.7s)]
*  and our external affairs team based in New York City, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1648.7s)]
*  this is in 2021, killed the deal, said, you can't do it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1651.06s)]
*  I was like, what do you mean? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1654.7s)]
*  Here's all the financials, this makes tons of sense. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1655.66s)]
*  This is a great company. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1657.6200000000001s)]
*  They're growing like gangbusters. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1658.74s)]
*  I said, can't do it, company's too controversial. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1660.22s)]
*  I was like, what do you mean? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1662.86s)]
*  Controversial. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1663.7s)]
*  I was like, the company, their mission [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1664.52s)]
*  is to serve coffee and culture to firefighters, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1665.82s)]
*  police officers, law enforcement, people who love them. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1667.88s)]
*  And the coffee just in point of fact is excellent. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1669.34s)]
*  Yeah, great coffee. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1672.94s)]
*  I drink it every day, it's great. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1673.78s)]
*  This is my thing. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1674.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's their mission, that's what they do. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1675.46s)]
*  And Budweiser, we had partnerships with Folds of Honor [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1678.26s)]
*  and other military, but in 2021, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1680.54s)]
*  because of the whole DEI movement, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1683.06s)]
*  which said, ooh, they fund the police [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1684.94s)]
*  and defund the police was a big thing [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1689.2600000000002s)]
*  kind of going on at the time. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1690.66s)]
*  And ooh, military, I don't know about that. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1691.66s)]
*  That seems a little bit too controversial. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1694.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm like, guys, we sell King Cobra 40 ounce bottles. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1696.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, all over the place. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1699.18s)]
*  America's favorite malt liquor. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1701.3000000000002s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1703.98s)]
*  Did you guys make Old English 800? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1704.8200000000002s)]
*  No, we didn't make Old English 800, no. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1706.1000000000001s)]
*  That was a brand, I drank that as a kid. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1707.7800000000002s)]
*  That's one of the reasons I no longer drink. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1709.94s)]
*  Yeah, did you ever do the Edward 40 hands with that one? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1711.3000000000002s)]
*  No, no, that was a... [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1714.0200000000002s)]
*  Did you miss the Edward 40 hands? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1715.5s)]
*  And it just, you know, everyone beats up on kids [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1716.82s)]
*  for being dumb, but actually the newer generations [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1719.1799999999998s)]
*  are way more brilliant than we ever were. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1722.02s)]
*  Edward 40 hands is like the funniest thing that ever happened. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1723.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Edward 40 hands was amazing. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1725.62s)]
*  So it was duct tape. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1727.06s)]
*  I'm against drinking, I don't know why I'm laughing. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1729.26s)]
*  I don't drink, I hate alcohol, but that is hilarious. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1731.1799999999998s)]
*  Duct tape, two 40 ounce malt liquors to kids' hands. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1735.1s)]
*  That's it, you know, you couldn't, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1738.54s)]
*  you couldn't untape them until you, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1740.06s)]
*  until you finished both of them. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1741.3799999999999s)]
*  So I feel guilty for laughing. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1742.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there were too many bad stories, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1744.54s)]
*  like, you know, someone get through one or half of them, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1745.98s)]
*  like, you know, you're rumbling around and you fall, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1747.18s)]
*  and it's like, you know, you get glass everywhere. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1748.78s)]
*  But anyway, so no, not OE, there were other ones. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1750.82s)]
*  Sorry, sorry for the digression. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1754.74s)]
*  But I can't remember where we're going with that. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1757.3s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1759.26s)]
*  No, we were talking Black Rifle. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1760.82s)]
*  And yeah, so the deal gets killed, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1762.5s)]
*  and that exact same, because it was too controversial [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1764.66s)]
*  of a brand, yet a year later, that exact same department [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1767.06s)]
*  based in New York City now, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1770.98s)]
*  that killed the Black Rifle coffee deal, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1772.9s)]
*  they greenlit the Dylan Mulvaney Partnership. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1774.7s)]
*  And the Dylan Mulvaney Partnership, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1777.3400000000001s)]
*  like it was incredibly puzzling if you're a Bud Light drinker. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1778.98s)]
*  And, you know, again, like, man, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1781.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't care how people identify [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1782.78s)]
*  or what they want to do with their lives, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1784.02s)]
*  but like one of the reasons that Bud Light became [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1785.5s)]
*  the biggest, most popular beer brand in the United States [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1788.0600000000002s)]
*  is because it was remarkably apolitical. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1790.22s)]
*  Like it was a brand that was enjoyed by Democrats [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1792.6200000000001s)]
*  and Republicans alike, because it was about like fun, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1794.38s)]
*  and it was humor, it was sort of this like, you know, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1796.6200000000001s)]
*  somewhat, you know, counter-cultural, you know, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1798.18s)]
*  type of brand, it was about sports and music and, you know, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1800.3000000000002s)]
*  backyard barbecues. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1802.66s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the Bud Light had just hired [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1804.1s)]
*  its first, you know, female head of Bud Light [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1807.4199999999998s)]
*  in the history of the brand. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1809.78s)]
*  You know, no problem with that, you know, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1811.26s)]
*  I'm sure there'll be a lot of people, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1812.58s)]
*  a lot of girls I know that would be great [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1814.4199999999998s)]
*  VP of marketers of Bud Light. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1815.82s)]
*  The problem with it was, the person they hired was a lady [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1817.22s)]
*  who had grown up in New York City, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1819.98s)]
*  went to Harvard for undergrad, Wharton for grad school, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1821.82s)]
*  had only lived in the base of the Northeastern entire life. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1824.34s)]
*  I don't know if she'd ever drank a Bud Light in her life, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1827.5s)]
*  and, you know, I don't know if she ever knew [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1828.86s)]
*  anybody who had as well. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1829.82s)]
*  And she was very- [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1831.1799999999998s)]
*  Why would she make her the head of the brand? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1832.3s)]
*  Well, because like the DEI movement basically said [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1834.4199999999998s)]
*  that you need to essentially, you know, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1836.54s)]
*  put different people in different roles. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1838.22s)]
*  You need a woman. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1839.62s)]
*  Yeah, based off immutable characteristics. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1840.46s)]
*  And even the 21, 22 time- [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1842.22s)]
*  What was her name? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1844.22s)]
*  Alyssa Heinerschneid. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1845.18s)]
*  And I know Alyssa, I mean, this Alyssa, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1846.54s)]
*  she's, you know, a nice girl, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1847.98s)]
*  and I worked with her when I was at the company for a while. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1848.98s)]
*  But she probably wasn't the right person for Bud Light. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1852.62s)]
*  But- [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1855.26s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1856.1s)]
*  Well, she obviously wasn't the right person for Bud Light. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1856.94s)]
*  Tank the company. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1857.78s)]
*  I mean, they're like, tank the brand. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1858.62s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1859.46s)]
*  Almost 50%. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1860.46s)]
*  So obviously wasn't the right person for the company. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1861.3s)]
*  But in this broader kind of narrative, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1865.58s)]
*  in 2021, 2022, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1867.7s)]
*  this is when I was deciding to kind of like [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1870.74s)]
*  leave Anheuser-Busch. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1872.58s)]
*  I'd mentioned the black rifle thing was kind of the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1873.54s)]
*  final sort of last straw for me. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1876.7s)]
*  But even before that, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1878.6599999999999s)]
*  the principles of the company changed. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1880.06s)]
*  My joining was the meritocracy. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1881.06s)]
*  It was like, we want to hire the best and brightest, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1882.1399999999999s)]
*  and we want to reward them based off their results [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1883.7s)]
*  and, you know, pay them accordingly. Great. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1885.5s)]
*  But in 21, 22, all of a sudden that principle, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1887.62s)]
*  there were 10 principles of the company, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1891.14s)]
*  that went around really hiring the best price [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1891.98s)]
*  changed towards, we now reward people based off the quality [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1893.58s)]
*  and diversity, which was bolded by the company [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1896.94s)]
*  and diversity of your teams. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1899.26s)]
*  And then all of a sudden the company starts [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1901.38s)]
*  putting in these diversity dashboards [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1903.82s)]
*  where you can see what the diversity makeup of your team is. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1905.7s)]
*  White men did a pretty good job making beer, I think. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1908.1000000000001s)]
*  Whatever you say about white men, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1910.5s)]
*  like they created the company and they made the beer. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1911.54s)]
*  Like why we hate them all of a sudden? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1913.38s)]
*  They created Budweiser. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1915.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it was just more so [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1917.02s)]
*  the head scratching piece of like, you know, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1918.8999999999999s)]
*  it doesn't matter if you're getting like white or black [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1920.62s)]
*  or gay or shit, like don't care. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1922.5s)]
*  I just want the best people. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1923.54s)]
*  Right, but the DEI is, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1924.5s)]
*  the only people discriminated against in DEI are white men, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1926.54s)]
*  obviously straight white men. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1928.9399999999998s)]
*  So like, I don't know. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1930.3799999999999s)]
*  There are probably some Asians in there too. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1932.06s)]
*  Well, they definitely have, well, they have been. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1933.82s)]
*  And a lot of Indians and a lot of other folks as well. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1936.1799999999998s)]
*  Absolutely, 100%, Asians, South Asians. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1937.9799999999998s)]
*  But the point of it was to reduce the percentage [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1940.3799999999999s)]
*  of white men in positions of leadership or with paying jobs. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1943.1s)]
*  And I just, I felt like nobody had the balls [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1946.94s)]
*  to say that out loud. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1949.5800000000002s)]
*  Like that was considered controversial. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1950.42s)]
*  You would get fired if you said that out loud. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1952.1000000000001s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1953.66s)]
*  This was in the 21, 20, 22 timeframe. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1954.5s)]
*  But that's the problem is where we were. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1955.98s)]
*  I mean, you know, this is censorship regime. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1957.38s)]
*  I mean, heck, you had the Biden administration. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1959.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, I got fired. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1961.22s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1962.0600000000002s)]
*  So you remember. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1962.9s)]
*  In the end, thank God. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1963.74s)]
*  But no, yes, I did get fired. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1966.26s)]
*  So actually it's kind of. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1967.6200000000001s)]
*  So you remember this. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1969.5800000000002s)]
*  I do, yeah, I guess I do. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1970.42s)]
*  Worse so than anybody. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1971.7800000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, you couldn't speak up there [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1973.7800000000002s)]
*  in this timeframe. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1975.74s)]
*  And then at the same time, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1977.1399999999999s)]
*  you had all these companies that made all these pledges. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1978.78s)]
*  I mean, the chief diversity officers. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1980.5s)]
*  Like this really wasn't even a position before 2020. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1982.86s)]
*  Chief diversity. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1985.62s)]
*  What do you make? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1987.06s)]
*  I make diversity. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1987.8999999999999s)]
*  But I mean, this is crazy. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1988.74s)]
*  Like, you know, and then all of a sudden [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1989.62s)]
*  there was like a 400% increase [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1990.46s)]
*  in chief diversity officer position. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1992.34s)]
*  And these were all high six figure salary positions. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1993.6999999999998s)]
*  All the executive level. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1996.5s)]
*  What do you do if you're a diversity officer? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1997.34s)]
*  This is the problem. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1998.98s)]
*  You find things to do. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=1999.82s)]
*  And this was the problem. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2001.02s)]
*  So the first thing was the whole pronoun police comes in. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2002.3s)]
*  Well, let's be more inclusive of all the pronoun piece. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2004.78s)]
*  And then, hey, let's put in quota systems [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2006.98s)]
*  that we're gonna put in place [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2008.7s)]
*  so we hire a certain number of people [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2009.58s)]
*  with a submutable characteristic or that of character. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2010.98s)]
*  Did everyone buy into the pronoun thing? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2012.62s)]
*  Did anyone say, I'm not doing that? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2014.46s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people did. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2016.22s)]
*  But this is the problem as well. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2017.62s)]
*  A lot of people just went along with it [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2018.74s)]
*  because they felt if you didn't, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2020.26s)]
*  then you could be called out by your HR team. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2021.82s)]
*  Cowards. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2023.98s)]
*  And I think that's what's part of the problem. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2024.82s)]
*  Now what's nice is that I think people have the ability. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2026.3799999999999s)]
*  So you know what, I'm not gonna do that. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2028.22s)]
*  But three years ago, you couldn't. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2029.1399999999999s)]
*  Three years ago was, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2030.22s)]
*  The whole thing is designed to degrade you. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2031.46s)]
*  What are you really saying, by the way, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2034.94s)]
*  if when you announce your pronouns, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2036.54s)]
*  what you're saying is it's not evident [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2037.7s)]
*  to people watching what your sex is? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2039.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2041.78s)]
*  Like your Pat or something from Saturday Night Live. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2042.6200000000001s)]
*  You may not know this, but I'm a man. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2044.58s)]
*  You can't tell by looking at me, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2046.42s)]
*  but I'm actually a man. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2047.98s)]
*  It's like the most degrading thing I can imagine. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2048.98s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2052.7s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2053.94s)]
*  And if you're unsure, just ask, how are you doing? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2055.38s)]
*  That's it. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2057.78s)]
*  And you don't even have to use a pronoun if you're unsure. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2058.62s)]
*  But I think for 99% of the time, you're pretty sure. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2060.1s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2062.1s)]
*  You're forcing this sort of agenda [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2062.94s)]
*  on 99% of the population says, wait a minute, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2064.26s)]
*  what is this? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2066.7000000000003s)]
*  I didn't know what this was. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2067.54s)]
*  But the people who work there, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2068.38s)]
*  I mean, now I'm being mean, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2069.2200000000003s)]
*  but I've lived it so I feel it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2070.06s)]
*  Like there were so few noble, honest, brave people [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2072.66s)]
*  in American corporate culture that I was shocked. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2077.68s)]
*  I was shocked by what sheep they were. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2080.94s)]
*  You'd think at least 20% would be like, buzz off. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2083.18s)]
*  I'm not giving you my food. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2086.2200000000003s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2087.06s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2087.9s)]
*  And by the way, you're discriminating against white men, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2088.7400000000002s)]
*  which is illegal and immoral. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2090.1s)]
*  And we've got this monument on the mall from Luther King [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2093.22s)]
*  telling us you can't do that, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2094.58s)]
*  but you're doing it anyway in his name. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2095.5s)]
*  Why don't you go screw yourself actually? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2097.7s)]
*  I don't think anybody said that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2099.74s)]
*  There were a couple of brave people. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2101.22s)]
*  This is all pointing. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2102.06s)]
*  But the brave people who stuck their neck out, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2103.58s)]
*  I mean, they were eviscerated in the media. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2105.12s)]
*  The first guy actually was Brian Armstrong. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2106.74s)]
*  He was the CEO of Coinbase. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2109.38s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2110.54s)]
*  I remember very well. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2111.38s)]
*  And this is at the end of 2020, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2112.2s)]
*  right after all of the BLM and everything. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2113.2599999999998s)]
*  And Brian Armstrong said, listen, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2115.54s)]
*  I'm not gonna tie it to the BLM movement. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2116.66s)]
*  I'm not gonna make a statement that we're in support of. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2118.46s)]
*  Tied this exactly right. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2120.5s)]
*  Of BLM, I'm not gonna do that either. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2122.06s)]
*  He said, because the mission of our company Coinbase [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2123.7000000000003s)]
*  is to bring crypto to the masses. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2126.38s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2127.6600000000003s)]
*  And if there's something related [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2128.5s)]
*  to crypto regulation or policy, sure. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2129.32s)]
*  We'll have a view on that. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2131.1s)]
*  But am I gonna have a view on climate change [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2132.34s)]
*  or BLM issues or transgender policy? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2135.2200000000003s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2138.54s)]
*  And by the way, if you as an employee don't wanna be here, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2139.58s)]
*  then go work somewhere else. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2143.48s)]
*  And I think they had, I don't know, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2145.7000000000003s)]
*  50 employees or something locked out, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2146.7000000000003s)]
*  but then he had 5,000 people that applied to work there. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2148.7400000000002s)]
*  But in the media though, he was called bigoted [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2152.06s)]
*  and he was called racist and he was called, you name it, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2154.34s)]
*  all in the media because of him just having a view [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2156.78s)]
*  that says, I'm just not gonna do this [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2158.82s)]
*  because that's not important to the company. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2160.1800000000003s)]
*  And if I want people to come here and work for our mission, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2162.2200000000003s)]
*  not necessarily for all these orthogonal things [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2164.58s)]
*  that have nothing to do with crypto to the masses. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2166.82s)]
*  It's funny how much just telling the story would, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2169.78s)]
*  I mean, of course I remember when it happened. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2171.78s)]
*  I defended him when it happened, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2173.06s)]
*  but it seems like you're talking about a different country. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2174.26s)]
*  Like things have changed so much. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2177.2200000000003s)]
*  That's my perception, is it yours? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2178.98s)]
*  It is, things have definitely swung back. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2182.38s)]
*  But as I mentioned earlier, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2184.54s)]
*  it's almost as if we're going into, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2185.82s)]
*  I would say it's almost three camps [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2188.02s)]
*  with the purpose of business in this country [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2189.82s)]
*  and business getting involved in social, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2192.14s)]
*  political, ESGDI topics. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2194.06s)]
*  You have the people that have backed off [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2196.34s)]
*  because they've said, you know what? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2197.66s)]
*  Getting involved in a lot of these political and social, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2199.22s)]
*  it wasn't good for my company from the stock standpoint [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2200.9s)]
*  and it wasn't because I lost money [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2204.54s)]
*  or divided my customer base. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2205.9s)]
*  It wasn't really good for the country either. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2207.18s)]
*  You've seen Meta and McDonald's and Walmart [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2208.4s)]
*  and Apple, or not Apple, sorry, Google. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2212.84s)]
*  A lot of people have rolled back a lot of those policies. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2215.6800000000003s)]
*  You have a second group of companies [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2217.8s)]
*  that are trying to kind of rebrand [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2219.6600000000003s)]
*  the whole sort of DEI narrative. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2221.1600000000003s)]
*  They haven't realized it's become a pejorative term [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2223.26s)]
*  to the majority of Americans. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2225.1s)]
*  They're calling it inclusivity, inclusivity and belonging, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2226.12s)]
*  or I don't know, all these other words [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2229.2000000000003s)]
*  they're trying to mash together. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2230.46s)]
*  I would put probably more of the JP Morgan's [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2232.7000000000003s)]
*  and I don't know, those folks in that boat. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2235.04s)]
*  But then you have the real adherence [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2237.28s)]
*  and these are the people that Philip Morris internationals. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2238.5600000000004s)]
*  Even today, I mean, Anna Heizer Bush InBev [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2241.48s)]
*  on their website for the UK, big DEI, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2243.2000000000003s)]
*  diversity, equity, inclusion piece, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  because I think you do have these real adherence. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2248.0600000000004s)]
*  And then even certain companies in the United States, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2249.84s)]
*  I mean, Costco is doubling down big time. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2251.28s)]
*  I think partly because they're based in Seattle. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2253.28s)]
*  And because I think- [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2255.1600000000003s)]
*  Costco. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2256.0s)]
*  Costco has doubled down big time. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2256.84s)]
*  That's like a warehouse store [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2258.4s)]
*  where you buy stuff by the pallet kind of thing. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  That's it, that place has doubled down massively. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2261.2000000000003s)]
*  Talking about that we're gonna continue [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2263.28s)]
*  to have quota systems about who we actually [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2264.6200000000003s)]
*  have preferential treatment to, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2266.96s)]
*  to who gets their products in store [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2268.2000000000003s)]
*  based off race or sex or gender. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2269.52s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2271.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they've been doubling down on this. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2271.96s)]
*  So they're one of the companies [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2273.2400000000002s)]
*  that has kind of dug their heels in. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2274.0800000000004s)]
*  I hope they go out of business soon. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2275.1600000000003s)]
*  But it's really interesting. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2277.28s)]
*  So the way that I think about it, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2278.1200000000003s)]
*  I think the companies that have just moved on, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2279.44s)]
*  I think we need to get them more to, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2281.0800000000004s)]
*  I'll go back to a corporate pluralism [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2282.84s)]
*  of whatever your mission is as a company, just do that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2285.36s)]
*  And however you need to recruit people, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2288.6000000000004s)]
*  the best and brightest to your industry, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2290.96s)]
*  figure out how to do that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2292.82s)]
*  I would say probably move on from the DEI. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2293.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't think we can say [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2296.88s)]
*  that the United States is civil rights law at that point. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2298.52s)]
*  If you're openly discriminating against people [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2301.2s)]
*  on the basis of their race, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2303.08s)]
*  then all the Civil Rights Act, it's all bullshit. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2304.2s)]
*  None of that means anything. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2306.06s)]
*  And so like, let's just stop pretending, okay? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2307.32s)]
*  So if Costco wants to continue with racist policies, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2310.62s)]
*  then I guess everyone gets to have racist policies [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2313.7s)]
*  if they want, on whatever basis of any race they want. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2315.96s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2317.9s)]
*  It's a principle. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2319.36s)]
*  So either you're against, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2320.44s)]
*  and in fact banning through federal law, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2323.28s)]
*  discrimination on the basis of race, or you're not. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2325.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2327.1800000000003s)]
*  it literally says you cannot discriminate [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2329.52s)]
*  based off race, sex, gender, national origin, et cetera. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2331.36s)]
*  And a thousand subsequent laws and regulations [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2333.2000000000003s)]
*  underscore that point, so. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2337.2400000000002s)]
*  And this is funny. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  So actually the Senate, the floor manager at the time [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2339.6800000000003s)]
*  was Hubert Humphreys, who became Lyndon Johnson's VP. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2342.6400000000003s)]
*  He was one who was ushering through [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2345.32s)]
*  the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2346.52s)]
*  He said, this is his quote, says, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2348.5600000000004s)]
*  if this leads to quota systems, I will eat my hat. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2350.28s)]
*  This was his quote. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2353.1200000000003s)]
*  And that's exactly what we got. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2354.2000000000003s)]
*  He's been dead too long to do it, but. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2355.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, it kind of wrecked the country. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2357.0s)]
*  Permanent Washington is terrified and distraught [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2358.96s)]
*  by the Trump revolution now in progress, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2361.5600000000004s)]
*  and it is a revolution, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2363.96s)]
*  and it's unfolding along very familiar lines. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2365.4s)]
*  The White House is now giving voters [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2368.36s)]
*  what they actually want, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2370.2200000000003s)]
*  and what they've wanted for a long time, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2372.0s)]
*  and that's the one thing that Permanent Washington [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2373.38s)]
*  doesn't want to give them. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2375.0400000000004s)]
*  They are working to stop it. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2377.76s)]
*  Fortunately, our friends at Heritage, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2379.6s)]
*  the Heritage Foundation in DC, are fighting back. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2380.96s)]
*  They've spent years thinking this through. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2383.2s)]
*  How do you dismantle Permanent DC, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2385.0s)]
*  the deep structures underneath everything? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2387.04s)]
*  How do you train replacements [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2389.0s)]
*  for the bureaucrats getting canned? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2390.08s)]
*  How do you enact policies that voters actually voted for? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2391.62s)]
*  Well, now that Biden is gone, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2395.24s)]
*  Heritage's vision is finally becoming reality, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2396.52s)]
*  and you can help push it forward [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2398.72s)]
*  by going to heritage.org slash Tucker [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2400.2s)]
*  and making a tax-deductible donation. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2402.56s)]
*  Your gift fuels their American Rescue Plan [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2404.56s)]
*  and helps stop Permanent Washington [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2407.72s)]
*  from crushing it from strangling it in the cradle. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2409.64s)]
*  Heritage has been doing this a long time. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2412.3599999999997s)]
*  They've been successful, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2414.02s)]
*  and they're more aggressive now than ever. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2414.98s)]
*  Their work is worth supporting. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2417.3799999999997s)]
*  Go to heritage.org slash Tucker to make your gift today. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2418.44s)]
*  We hope you will. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2421.96s)]
*  So just back to Anheuser-Busch. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2423.04s)]
*  This disaster happens, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2425.6s)]
*  and it seems to be, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2428.5s)]
*  I mean, according to the video that everybody saw, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2431.2799999999997s)]
*  it really a product of this one decision. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2434.16s)]
*  Well, it's the end of a chain of a lot of decisions, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2436.4s)]
*  as you so ably described. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2438.04s)]
*  But the key decision in the fall of Bud Light [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2440.44s)]
*  was by this Alyssa Schneinhauser, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2444.08s)]
*  whatever her name was, who went to Harvard. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2447.12s)]
*  And there's this famous video where she's saying, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2450.1s)]
*  basically, I think the old white guys who drink our beer [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2452.96s)]
*  could used to be shaken up a little bit. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2457.32s)]
*  The fratty and out of touch. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2459.2000000000003s)]
*  That Bud Light's been fratty and out of touch. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2460.2000000000003s)]
*  Sorry, thank you. Fratty and out of touch. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2462.1600000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2464.1600000000003s)]
*  And I just have to say, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2465.0s)]
*  she didn't run the company, she's head of the brand, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2466.2400000000002s)]
*  she has supervisors. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2468.1600000000003s)]
*  Someone who worked for me, well, we sell Alp. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2469.4s)]
*  And if someone's in a meeting with me, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2471.88s)]
*  the problem with Alp is its users suck, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2474.56s)]
*  and they've got antique retrograde attitudes, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2477.4s)]
*  and we just need to give them the finger. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2479.92s)]
*  I would say, you're fired, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2481.7000000000003s)]
*  because you don't love our people. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2483.96s)]
*  That's it, exactly. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2486.04s)]
*  So I just- Why did no one say that? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2487.1600000000003s)]
*  But that's what's crazy is that [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2488.82s)]
*  she literally called the customer base the fratty, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2490.7000000000003s)]
*  out of touch, and immediately lost trust [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2493.48s)]
*  with the whole entire customer base. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2496.28s)]
*  And what are you guys talking about? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2497.32s)]
*  Do people like to be lectured? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2499.56s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2501.04s)]
*  Just go love it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2501.88s)]
*  Nailed at by Alyssa Schneidhauser from Harvard. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2502.72s)]
*  And what's crazy about this, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2506.84s)]
*  so the timeline of events was, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2508.44s)]
*  because we're coming up on actually two years [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2510.68s)]
*  when this happened, so this partnership [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2512.0s)]
*  that Bud Light did with Dylan Mulvaney, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2513.84s)]
*  and controversial transgender actors, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2515.56s)]
*  happened on April Fool's Day of 2023. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2517.36s)]
*  So, and a lot of people originally thought this was a joke, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2520.68s)]
*  Bud Light must be joking about this, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2524.36s)]
*  because there's no way that they would ever [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2525.48s)]
*  do a partnership with somebody [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2526.96s)]
*  who was literally just at Joe Biden's White House, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2527.92s)]
*  advocating for gender affirmation care [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2529.86s)]
*  and biological men and competing against women in sports. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2531.8s)]
*  But this is all of a sudden Bud Light's [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2533.92s)]
*  partnership with this, I don't understand this. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2535.32s)]
*  Then two or three days later, that video comes out [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2537.8s)]
*  of Alyssa essentially being like, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2539.84s)]
*  Bud Light is fratty and out of touch. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2541.28s)]
*  We're gonna be more- Fratty and out of touch. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2543.2400000000002s)]
*  And we're gonna be more inclusive. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2544.84s)]
*  Out of touch with what? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2545.68s)]
*  That's the problem, Alyssa was out of touch. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2546.84s)]
*  I mean, this is who's out of touch. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2549.0s)]
*  You've got some self-awareness, honey. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2551.44s)]
*  It's crazy with what's going on. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2553.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is how out of touch, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2555.0400000000004s)]
*  I think a lot of the people in New York became. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2556.52s)]
*  Where all of a sudden they're saying, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  no, no, no, our customers are out of touch, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2560.84s)]
*  we need new customers, and the new customers [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2562.36s)]
*  are gonna be whoever follows Dylan Mulvaney on Instagram, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  which I think was actually mostly underage girls. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2566.92s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2569.84s)]
*  Cause there were literally all of these [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2572.32s)]
*  now investigations going on, saying, wait a minute, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2573.88s)]
*  you guys sponsored a Mulvaney who just has [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2576.5600000000004s)]
*  a bunch of underage followers? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2577.96s)]
*  Like, what are you guys doing? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2579.1600000000003s)]
*  This makes no sense. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2580.0600000000004s)]
*  You dress like a child? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2581.46s)]
*  Some dude dressed like a little girl? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2583.26s)]
*  First of all, who's looking into that guy's personal life? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2585.02s)]
*  You know, like that's dark. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2587.94s)]
*  Yeah, so the partnership itself [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2589.46s)]
*  was obviously incredibly flawed. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2592.1800000000003s)]
*  Is it true that Dylan Mulvaney is like a huge Zen user? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2594.34s)]
*  Someone told me that he loves Zen. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2597.52s)]
*  I don't know, I've never met Dylan. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2598.9s)]
*  I don't know if that's true or not. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2600.34s)]
*  You should have Dylan on the show, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2601.6600000000003s)]
*  so you can figure it out. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2603.02s)]
*  Know what? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2603.94s)]
*  You should, you should. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2605.1800000000003s)]
*  I keep hearing, and I have no idea if it's true, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2606.02s)]
*  I'm not endorsing this, but that Philip Morris [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2607.7000000000003s)]
*  and Zen are hiring Dylan Mulvaney. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2610.06s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2612.1s)]
*  I don't know, I mean, based off what I saw on their website, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2613.1s)]
*  I think it would make perfect sense. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2614.94s)]
*  I mean, they're almost becoming the Ben and Jerry's of a. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2616.34s)]
*  100%. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2618.74s)]
*  I mean, that's what it is. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2619.58s)]
*  And actually, you know what? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2620.54s)]
*  That's fine, I don't want that in my mouth. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2621.38s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, I just don't. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2622.66s)]
*  You know what? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2623.5s)]
*  I actually respect Ben and Jerry's as a brand, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2624.34s)]
*  because they at least stand. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2626.74s)]
*  They're very clear about what they stand for. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2627.58s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2628.7s)]
*  They say, we're gonna use ice cream [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2629.54s)]
*  to advance a socially progressive nation. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2630.86s)]
*  Great, hey, in this country, you can do that. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2632.82s)]
*  There's a customer base for that. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2634.2599999999998s)]
*  Go do that, serve that customer. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2635.5s)]
*  I agree more. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2636.5s)]
*  I find their ideas repugnant, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2637.34s)]
*  but I respect their bravery and their principle. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2638.54s)]
*  Their ice cream's unbelievable. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2641.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna get diabetes if I eat it again. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2642.98s)]
*  But it's really good, and they're consistent in their views. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2645.1400000000003s)]
*  And I appreciate that. Yeah, they're consistent in their views. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2648.38s)]
*  But a company like Zen or AB, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2650.06s)]
*  you had no idea that they were spending money [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2652.3s)]
*  on causes that were in direct conflict with your own family. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2656.5s)]
*  These people hate your family. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2661.34s)]
*  And you're buying their products. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2662.9s)]
*  And this was the whole deal. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2663.94s)]
*  Obviously, the partnership itself made no sense. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2665.2599999999998s)]
*  But the response to it was just as harmful. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2667.54s)]
*  And that was just as problematic. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2670.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2671.86s)]
*  Because if you recall, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2672.7s)]
*  so Alyssa goes on the TV where she's fratty, out of touch. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2674.54s)]
*  Kid Rock then lights up a pack of Bud Light with an AR-15, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2678.18s)]
*  which was a big deal. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2681.86s)]
*  So then all of a sudden, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2682.94s)]
*  you have all of these sort of people saying, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2683.78s)]
*  screw Bud Light, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2685.78s)]
*  people posting videos of them not buying it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2686.62s)]
*  And then the company said, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2689.18s)]
*  hey, there was a quick press release saying, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2691.74s)]
*  yes, we do partnerships with influencers [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2694.58s)]
*  to celebrate milestones. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2696.58s)]
*  In this case, we did this milestone of 365 days of women. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2698.22s)]
*  And everyone's like, what are you talking about? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2701.94s)]
*  Bud Light? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2703.3s)]
*  It's a dude, by the way. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2704.14s)]
*  It's not, these are not women. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2704.98s)]
*  These are men dressed as women. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2706.18s)]
*  The whole thing is so insulting. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2707.5s)]
*  And in the same way, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2708.82s)]
*  you probably wouldn't at that time [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2709.66s)]
*  have sent a can to Donald Trump to celebrate his coming in. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2710.86s)]
*  100%. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2713.86s)]
*  Because Bud Light was not a political brand. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2714.7s)]
*  And so everyone's really confused. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2716.5s)]
*  And so the sales just tumbled. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2718.1s)]
*  What's really- [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2719.34s)]
*  Was that obvious right away? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2720.66s)]
*  So yeah, so this is what's really interesting. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2722.18s)]
*  Boycotts tend to work for two reasons. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2723.86s)]
*  And they actually had never worked almost in history. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2726.38s)]
*  Everyone talks about, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2727.9s)]
*  I hate it when the NFL had the whole kneeling thing going on, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2728.74s)]
*  but NFL ratings were super high. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2730.98s)]
*  Other people have called it a boycott, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2732.62s)]
*  come and tell me it's never worked. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2733.7799999999997s)]
*  But in this case, it worked for two reasons. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2734.62s)]
*  One, if there's a easily accessible substitute. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2736.34s)]
*  So if you think about it, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2740.22s)]
*  everywhere you can buy Bud Light, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2741.06s)]
*  you have Coors Light, you have Miller Light. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2742.06s)]
*  I mean, you go to a gas station, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2743.42s)]
*  you have Coors Light six packs, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2744.42s)]
*  Miller Light six packs, Bud Light six packs. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2745.7s)]
*  And then you also go to a bar, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2747.7s)]
*  you have Miller Light on tap, you have Bud Light on tap. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2748.74s)]
*  And for 95% of Americans, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2750.42s)]
*  Bud Light is indistinguishable from Coors Light [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2752.26s)]
*  and from Miller Light. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2754.06s)]
*  So the substitutes are easily there. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2754.98s)]
*  Do you know, I quit drinking before light beer was a thing. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2756.6200000000003s)]
*  I never have had a light beer in my life. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2758.9s)]
*  Men just did not drink light beer when I quit drinking. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2761.2200000000003s)]
*  Is it good? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2764.86s)]
*  But like, yeah, I've never had a Bud Light. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2765.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you like light beer, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2767.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's a great light beer. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2769.2200000000003s)]
*  It's very consistent. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2770.3s)]
*  They have great brew masters. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2771.1400000000003s)]
*  They have, so it's very good as a product. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2772.3s)]
*  But so also is Coors and Miller Light. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2774.86s)]
*  But it's almost like a commodity of a brand. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2776.82s)]
*  So therefore the only thing you actually did have [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2780.9s)]
*  was your brand itself, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2782.3s)]
*  which Bud Light was funny, humorous and apolitical. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2784.06s)]
*  The other reason that boycotts work is that [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2787.38s)]
*  if you actually feel like you're having an impact [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2788.86s)]
*  and having an effect. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2790.6600000000003s)]
*  And the other thing that happens, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2791.82s)]
*  which is interesting in the beer industry is every week, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2792.98s)]
*  you get data that's reported by Walmart and Kroger [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2795.14s)]
*  and 7-Eleven and all these big retailers [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2798.1800000000003s)]
*  about what sales look like. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2800.98s)]
*  And that's just reported every week. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2802.26s)]
*  Usually people don't care about that at all. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2804.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, no one ever cares what the real sales are. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2805.54s)]
*  But in this instance, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2807.58s)]
*  all of a sudden the media was reporting every single week [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2809.74s)]
*  that Bud Light sales were down 10%, 20%, 30%. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2812.02s)]
*  So it's snowballed. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2815.62s)]
*  So it starts snowballing. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2816.54s)]
*  And in Anne's Bush, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2817.7799999999997s)]
*  they can't starve the media of information and data. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2819.58s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2822.8999999999996s)]
*  like Anne's Bush is watching their sales decline a lot. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2823.9399999999996s)]
*  And they realize, wow, we gotta do something. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2826.74s)]
*  The problem was they always say they're stuck between this, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2829.54s)]
*  the Black Rock and a hard place. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2832.5s)]
*  It's Black Rock was saying, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2834.18s)]
*  hey, you guys need more DEI and inclusivity. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2835.02s)]
*  And that's the agenda we're pushing. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2838.3s)]
*  There are corporations like the Human Rights Campaign [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2840.6600000000003s)]
*  that scores Anne Heiser Bush every single year on their- [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2842.6600000000003s)]
*  Why would a beer company, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2845.98s)]
*  I mean, the Human Rights Company, they're freaks. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2847.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, they're literally freaks and they're evil, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2850.1400000000003s)]
*  completely evil in my opinion. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2852.5800000000004s)]
*  It's not about equality. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2854.1800000000003s)]
*  It's about crushing families and Christianity, obviously. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2855.42s)]
*  So why would a beer company care what they think? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2858.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, because the problem was again, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2861.26s)]
*  Black Rock, State Street, Vanguard, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2863.02s)]
*  who are technically these large shareholders [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2864.9s)]
*  of your business, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2866.78s)]
*  they have adopted ESG and DEI. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2867.74s)]
*  And they're saying, if you wanna get included [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2869.7799999999997s)]
*  in our ESG indexes, or like Bloomberg, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2871.2999999999997s)]
*  Bloomberg has a gender equality index. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2874.02s)]
*  If you wanna get included in these, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2875.98s)]
*  you guys need to have a perfect score [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2877.54s)]
*  on the Human Rights Campaign. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2879.1s)]
*  Man, if I'm the Chinese, I'm encouraging this a lot. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2880.18s)]
*  100%. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2882.58s)]
*  Because you just wreck your opponent with this stuff. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2883.4199999999996s)]
*  It's insane, it made no sense. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2885.66s)]
*  And when the Human Rights Campaign started, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2887.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know, 20 years ago, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2888.74s)]
*  the whole thing was like, okay, like, I don't know, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2889.9399999999996s)]
*  don't make fun of like, I don't know, LGBTQ plus, okay, fine. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2891.54s)]
*  I was never against Human Rights Campaign. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2894.74s)]
*  I worked like a block from them for 15 years [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2897.94s)]
*  in downtown DC on 17th Street. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2900.3s)]
*  I was never against them at all. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2902.42s)]
*  I was like, okay, I'm for civil liberties, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2904.1800000000003s)]
*  including for gays. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2906.38s)]
*  I'm not against that at all, I'm for it. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2907.38s)]
*  But it became incredibly rigid. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2909.7000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't about that at all. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2910.82s)]
*  It was about destroying American society, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2912.2200000000003s)]
*  which they have done a lot to achieve. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2914.1s)]
*  And now to get these perfect scores, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2915.7000000000003s)]
*  then you had to have so many commercials [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2917.26s)]
*  that advertised to LGBTQ plus. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2918.82s)]
*  You had to do all the gender affirmation stuff [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2921.38s)]
*  in your healthcare. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2923.2200000000003s)]
*  You gotta sell gay beer. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2924.06s)]
*  I mean, that was essentially like what it was becoming. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2924.9s)]
*  And even the company itself, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2927.86s)]
*  I mean, they were trying to win these like con line awards [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2929.26s)]
*  over in Europe. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2931.46s)]
*  And so we used to always think like our advertisement [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2932.46s)]
*  was, did you win the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter Award? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2936.26s)]
*  That showed like you were in touch [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2938.5s)]
*  with the kind of American consumer. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2939.38s)]
*  And for, I mean, from like 2003 to 2013, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2940.9s)]
*  Annis Bush won it every single year. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2943.94s)]
*  Then when they brought in new European ownership [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2945.7000000000003s)]
*  and new marketers, all of a sudden they didn't win it [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2947.3s)]
*  for 10 plus years. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2949.5s)]
*  And what they tried now start winning [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2950.62s)]
*  and showing they won these con line awards, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2953.2599999999998s)]
*  which over in Europe, they have these awards in con France. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2955.4599999999996s)]
*  And to win the con line advertising awards, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2958.7799999999997s)]
*  you have to have your DEI and your ESG policies. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2960.8599999999997s)]
*  And you have to do all of the advertisements [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2964.1s)]
*  that are essentially- [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2966.22s)]
*  You sell beer, why do you care about an award [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2967.06s)]

*  I call it the stakeholder capital industrial complex. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2986.54s)]
*  And everybody was just trying to make money. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2988.58s)]
*  McKinsey, they were the big consulting firm. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2990.5s)]
*  I mean, they had this again, this diversity matter, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2992.8599999999997s)]
*  diversity wins report to sell consulting services for DEI. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2994.8199999999997s)]
*  Black Rock had a whole DEI component [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=2998.7799999999997s)]
*  to put people into certain funds [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3001.8199999999997s)]
*  to charge investors more money. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3003.1s)]
*  You had a lot of activists that they wanted to show [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3004.8199999999997s)]
*  that they could get more money from Soros or whoever else [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3007.5s)]
*  that they're making progress by putting up [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3010.58s)]
*  actually activist proposals at companies [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3012.66s)]
*  that shareholders would then vote on. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3014.54s)]
*  So it was this big almost like industrial complex [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3016.34s)]
*  just kept feeding on itself. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3018.62s)]
*  To destroy the meritocracy and destroy the United States. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3020.02s)]
*  I mean, essentially like that's where we were- [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3022.2599999999998s)]
*  It destroys the country. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3024.22s)]
*  If you don't have a meritocracy, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3025.18s)]
*  if the best people can't rise [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3026.5s)]
*  because of the wrong color or the wrong sex, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3028.14s)]
*  then your country collapses. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3030.38s)]
*  And almost, I mean, Bud Light was essentially holding the pin [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3031.22s)]
*  when this whole, I mean, bubble popped. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3033.9s)]
*  They were, this was the first time that people saw like, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3036.06s)]
*  wait a minute, okay, I didn't like when Disney [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3037.9s)]
*  got involved in the parental rights issues down in Florida, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3040.94s)]
*  but Disney is always kind of a little out there. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3042.46s)]
*  And it didn't make any sense [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3045.1400000000003s)]
*  that Disney was getting involved in this year. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3046.42s)]
*  Well, it's the same attitude, same- [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3047.94s)]
*  But kind of same attitude. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3049.6200000000003s)]
*  But the problem with Disney is that, okay, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3051.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't like Disney, but there's only one Disney world. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3053.5s)]
*  I don't really have a lot of other places to go. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3055.0600000000004s)]
*  So I'm still gonna go to Disney. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3056.86s)]
*  But with Bud Light, people easily went to Coors Light. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3057.7000000000003s)]
*  And so going back to this whole story [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3060.94s)]
*  about why the response was so damaging. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3063.3s)]
*  So all the- [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3064.9s)]
*  Can I just ask, since you worked there [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3065.7400000000002s)]
*  and you've written a book on it. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3067.5800000000004s)]
*  And I left by this point. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3069.5s)]
*  So that was a very- [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3070.82s)]
*  Right, of course, but I mean, you know the business. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3071.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3072.78s)]
*  What's the right, before you explain what they did, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3073.82s)]
*  what's the right answer? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3076.2200000000003s)]
*  So you're running Anheuser-Busch right now. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3077.42s)]
*  This happens. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3079.78s)]
*  It's a huge threat to your core business, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3081.38s)]
*  which is selling beer. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3083.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3084.1800000000003s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3085.02s)]
*  I mean, like the answer is so simple. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3086.38s)]
*  The first thing you do is that you fired the VP of marketing [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3087.5s)]
*  who just called your entire customer base [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3089.86s)]
*  fratting it out of touch. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3092.34s)]
*  And then you say we fired her [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3093.7000000000003s)]
*  because that was obviously not empathetic to our customers [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3095.06s)]
*  and not core business. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3098.42s)]
*  You can't work here. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3100.2200000000003s)]
*  You can't work here. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3101.0600000000004s)]
*  Like just like, done, like out. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3101.9s)]
*  And then separately, like the biggest piece is like, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3103.3s)]
*  then you just apologize. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3105.0200000000004s)]
*  You know, I always say it's like the- [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3106.26s)]
*  Apologize? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3107.6200000000003s)]
*  Are you crazy? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3110.46s)]
*  But it's like the path to like, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3111.5800000000004s)]
*  I always say like redemption goes through forgiveness. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3113.0200000000004s)]
*  But the only way you're going to be forgiven [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3115.34s)]
*  is if you admit you made a mistake. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3116.86s)]
*  And then what you say is like, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3118.82s)]
*  hey, this was obviously a mistake that this person made. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3119.7400000000002s)]
*  And so we've moved on from this person [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3122.6200000000003s)]
*  because we've made a mistake hiring this person, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3124.1400000000003s)]
*  putting them in. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3125.7000000000003s)]
*  And then separately also, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3126.5400000000004s)]
*  we made a mistake as Bud Light. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3127.7s)]
*  We made a mistake because Bud Light was never supposed [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3129.2599999999998s)]
*  to be involved in controversial political issues. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3131.8599999999997s)]
*  And Dylan Mulvaney was not the right choice of a person [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3134.46s)]
*  to get involved with because there are things, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3137.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, if you recall as well, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3139.7799999999997s)]
*  the week that this partnership happened, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3142.4199999999996s)]
*  this was during the time when a lot of legislation [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3144.22s)]
*  is in session. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3146.7799999999997s)]
*  So there were, I think 25 bills across the country [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3147.62s)]
*  to ban biological men from playing its women in sports. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3150.02s)]
*  There was a bunch of bills, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3152.7s)]
*  banning gender transformation care. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3153.54s)]
*  And also leading up to this week, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3154.8599999999997s)]
*  that was the week that you had the transgender shooter [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3156.14s)]
*  in the Christian school in Tennessee. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3158.58s)]
*  Yeah, the who's manifesto we weren't allowed to see. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3160.5s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3162.2599999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, this was like a very big issue [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3163.08s)]
*  across the entire country right now. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3165.06s)]
*  So violent group, whoa. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3166.58s)]
*  So this is why there was a lot of problems [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3168.02s)]
*  with Dylan Mulvaney who had become kind of the face [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3170.66s)]
*  of really the very progressive transgender movement [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3172.7s)]
*  and why Bud Light never should have done the partnership [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3174.74s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3176.22s)]
*  And say like, because Bud Light was always about fun [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3177.1s)]
*  and music and sports, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3179.46s)]
*  it's like we should have never had this person [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3180.2999999999997s)]
*  as a sponsorship. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3181.98s)]
*  Okay, they shouldn't have, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3183.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is a sponsor either. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3183.94s)]
*  Of course, I agree. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3185.46s)]
*  Just so that's what Bud Light now. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3186.3s)]
*  You sell beer, just sell your beer. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3188.1400000000003s)]
*  We're gonna get back to selling beer. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3189.82s)]
*  Guys, we screwed up, we apologize. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3191.2200000000003s)]
*  We want our customers back, we're selling beer, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3192.7000000000003s)]
*  end of story. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3194.4s)]
*  The problem is they couldn't do that [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3195.48s)]
*  because they'd made all these other commitments [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3196.92s)]
*  to the human rights campaign, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3198.98s)]
*  who they highlighted every single year [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3200.1400000000003s)]
*  in their annual ESG report [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3202.26s)]
*  that they had a perfect score on it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3204.2200000000003s)]
*  They had made- [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3206.1000000000004s)]
*  But the human rights campaign is like, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3206.94s)]
*  they're not big shareholders of AB. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3208.34s)]
*  No, but- [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3210.54s)]
*  They have no right to run a beer company. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3211.38s)]
*  But they're a stakeholder of AB [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3213.1000000000004s)]
*  and that becomes the problem. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3214.6s)]
*  You have all these- [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3216.44s)]
*  They have no moral legitimacy. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3217.2599999999998s)]
*  Even if you love the human rights campaign, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3219.48s)]
*  which is totally evil, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3221.68s)]
*  that's my opinion, having known them, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3223.36s)]
*  but even if you love them, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3226.32s)]
*  why do they get a veto over the behavior [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3228.02s)]
*  of a huge publicly traded company? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3232.04s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3233.7599999999998s)]
*  It all just feeds on itself, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3235.0s)]
*  and it's called the stakeholder capitalism [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3236.56s)]
*  industrial complex. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3238.2s)]
*  But the stakeholder, really, the beer drinkers. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3239.2799999999997s)]
*  But that's the problem, that became the- [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3241.52s)]
*  We can insult them. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3242.84s)]
*  Your customer became sort of the lowest priority, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3244.8799999999997s)]
*  which is the problem. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3246.2s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3247.04s)]
*  And this made no sense. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3247.8799999999997s)]
*  It made zero sense. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3248.7s)]
*  And then so again, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3249.54s)]
*  this partnership originally happened on April 1st. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3250.9199999999996s)]
*  On April 15th, that's when you have the CEO [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3252.64s)]
*  for the first time, a guy named Brendan Whitworth, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3255.3199999999997s)]
*  who I know very well. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3257.0s)]
*  He made a first public essentially response. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3258.8799999999997s)]
*  And it's almost this comical letter. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3262.24s)]
*  I think it was called like, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3264.64s)]
*  Our Letter to America or something. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3265.4599999999996s)]
*  Where he never acknowledged the situation they were in. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3267.7599999999998s)]
*  They never acknowledged the controversy. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3270.4799999999996s)]
*  Never mentioned Dylan by name. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3272.0s)]
*  It was just a, hey, we're gonna get back to brewing beer, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3274.5600000000004s)]
*  and here's a video of Clydesdale riding across America. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3276.0800000000004s)]
*  And as you can imagine, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3279.28s)]
*  the outrage was palpable, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3281.44s)]
*  both on the right, from their little customers, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3283.92s)]
*  that were like, wait a minute, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3285.76s)]
*  we wanted that exact kind of apology, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3286.6000000000004s)]
*  and hey, we fired the person I just gave. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3288.6200000000003s)]
*  But then now you have all these people on the left [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3290.46s)]
*  that are saying, wait a minute, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3291.92s)]
*  I wanted you guys to say you're gonna become [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3293.04s)]
*  like Ben and Jerry's. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3294.6000000000004s)]
*  I want you guys to be doing more of the Dylan campaign. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3295.6000000000004s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, the company, actually, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3299.04s)]
*  its sales declined even more. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3301.2000000000003s)]
*  And funny enough. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3302.84s)]
*  Is he still there? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3304.0s)]
*  He's still there, which is crazy. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3305.08s)]
*  Everyone is still there. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3305.92s)]
*  There's been zero accountability for this. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3306.76s)]
*  Despite the fact. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3308.36s)]
*  I don't wanna say, so, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3309.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't know the guy, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3311.2400000000002s)]
*  I've met him and talked to him, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3312.08s)]
*  former CIA guy. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3313.48s)]
*  Former CIA guy. He told me. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3314.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3315.8s)]
*  Extremely physically fit. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3317.42s)]
*  Big, big, big crossfit guy. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3319.28s)]
*  Most CEOs I've met, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3320.48s)]
*  and particularly the more disconnected [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3322.2000000000003s)]
*  from manufacturing they are, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3324.6800000000003s)]
*  the more finance oriented they are, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3326.52s)]
*  the better physical condition they're in. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3328.2000000000003s)]
*  Just cut jaw lines. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3330.28s)]
*  They've all played lacrosse at Middlebury. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3331.48s)]
*  They're always on the- [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3333.0s)]
*  The guy looks like G.I. Joe. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3333.84s)]
*  100%. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3334.68s)]
*  I'm not against physical fitness. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3335.6s)]
*  I could use a little more myself. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3336.92s)]
*  But that doesn't seem like a relevant criterion [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3339.0s)]
*  if you're choosing a CEO and yet every, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3341.6s)]
*  Larry Fink is kind of pudgy, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3344.52s)]
*  so I'm on his side for that. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3345.64s)]
*  But it feels like whoever's doing the hiring here [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3347.4s)]
*  is doing it based on appearance. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3350.16s)]
*  And these are white people mostly, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3351.48s)]
*  so it's not DEI exactly, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3352.84s)]
*  but it is a form of DEI. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3355.8s)]
*  Like why, like that guy seemed like every other CEO [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3356.92s)]
*  I've met in the last 10 years. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3361.32s)]
*  Vapid, afraid, completely terrified. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3363.36s)]
*  You could smell the fear on the guy. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3366.52s)]
*  Obsessed with his physical appearance [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3368.48s)]
*  and totally lacking creativity. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3371.88s)]
*  Are those fair descriptions? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3374.2400000000002s)]
*  That was just my reaction from spending an evening with him. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3375.52s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3379.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, you spent one evening with him. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3380.0s)]
*  I spent, I don't know, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3381.1600000000003s)]
*  I've known Brendan for 10 years, 15 years. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3382.0s)]
*  I'm not saying he's like a terrible person. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3383.48s)]
*  I'm sure, you know, I don't know that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3384.7200000000003s)]
*  But he is definitely, and I hate to single him out, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3387.2000000000003s)]
*  well, he's a former CIA guy, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3390.12s)]
*  which should be disqualifying right there. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3391.92s)]
*  But, oh, I'm sorry. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3393.2799999999997s)]
*  But like he seemed emblematic of an entire class of people [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3395.2799999999997s)]
*  who in my pretty extensive experience around them [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3399.92s)]
*  are deeply unimpressive. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3403.0s)]
*  Like I would not hire any of them to do anything in my life. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3405.12s)]
*  I think the bigger piece is just, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3408.4s)]
*  it's the lack of courage. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3409.72s)]
*  And I think we saw this with a lot of CEOs. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3411.16s)]
*  And I think especially with Brendan Ware, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3413.44s)]
*  so he reported into a global CEO, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3416.08s)]
*  which is this guy, Michel Ducares, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3418.6s)]
*  who's European and kind of- [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3420.12s)]
*  I'm sure he's a good guy. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3422.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3423.68s)]
*  So, and I think this is, again, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3424.68s)]
*  some like French mastermind. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3426.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, but it's a little bit of that, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3429.56s)]
*  where Brendan all of a sudden, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3430.96s)]
*  like again, he needed to take a hard stand [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3432.44s)]
*  and say, you know what, we screwed up. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3433.92s)]
*  We're firing this person. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3435.08s)]
*  We apologize. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3436.24s)]
*  We're gonna get back to doing Bud Light commercials [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3437.12s)]
*  that are fun and humorous, whatever else. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3439.04s)]
*  And he didn't do it. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3440.8399999999997s)]
*  And he didn't do it that first time in April. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3442.24s)]
*  There was another really- [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3444.24s)]
*  But so how does he keep his job? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3445.4s)]
*  I'll get back to that in a second. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3447.36s)]
*  But then like, this was really telling. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3448.84s)]
*  There was, going into July 4th weekend of 2023, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3450.4s)]
*  this is the biggest beer selling weekend of the year. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3453.96s)]
*  Bud Light sales had tanked down 30, 40%. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3455.76s)]
*  The stocks lost $40 billion in market cap. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3458.04s)]
*  The business had gone from making $6 billion- [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3460.7200000000003s)]
*  It lost how much in market cap? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3463.2000000000003s)]
*  It lost $40 billion in market cap. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3464.48s)]
*  40 billion? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3465.92s)]
*  40 billion in market cap. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3466.76s)]
*  I mean, the stock was around $70 a share [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3467.6000000000004s)]
*  when this happened and went down to $40 billion. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3469.6000000000004s)]
*  So how can this Alyssa chick and the CIA dude still, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3470.44s)]
*  I mean, how could they ever work again in American business? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3473.6800000000003s)]
*  $40 billion? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3476.04s)]
*  You'll love this. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3477.36s)]
*  Alyssa was placed on leave at some point along this. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3478.2000000000003s)]
*  She's actually now working for Liv in the Liv tour, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3480.44s)]
*  the Saudi golf tour, which is like- [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3483.2000000000003s)]
*  Not really. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3484.36s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3485.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel like you can't make this up. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3486.04s)]
*  Actually? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3486.88s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3487.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I swear to God. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3488.54s)]
*  So it's, at least on her LinkedIn, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3489.38s)]
*  is working for the Liv Saudi golf tour. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3491.2000000000003s)]
*  So anyway, that's, we can get to that in a second. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3492.84s)]
*  So we'll get to that in a second. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3495.8s)]
*  But the, so going to July 4th weekend of 2023, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3498.44s)]
*  for the first time, Brendan goes on national TV [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3501.6800000000003s)]
*  and he goes on CBS and he has this live interview [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3504.52s)]
*  where he's going to try and get this back on track [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3507.52s)]
*  because he's now missed twice with the response [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3510.36s)]
*  and it's only antagonized people and things have gotten worse. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3512.48s)]
*  So he goes on CBS and one of the hosts, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3515.36s)]
*  first off says, hey, thank you for being here. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3517.04s)]
*  Cause most people in your seat, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3518.6800000000003s)]
*  they would have run for the hills. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3519.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, after what we've seen with millions [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3520.6800000000003s)]
*  of customers losing, leaving you billions of dollars [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3522.64s)]
*  being lost, but they say, hey, the question everyone [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3525.1600000000003s)]
*  wants to know is was this partnership a mistake [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3527.88s)]
*  and would you do it again? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3530.4s)]
*  And he gives some real wishy washy mealy mouth answer. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3532.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of things going on in the world [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3536.0s)]
*  and culture and this and that. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3537.84s)]
*  And after 30 seconds of kind of wavering around, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3538.96s)]
*  the host comes back and says, to be clear, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3541.82s)]
*  like you do realize the answer you just gave [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3543.44s)]
*  is the reason why millions of people left, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3545.36s)]
*  billions of dollars have been erased. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3547.6s)]
*  Let me ask again, was this campaign a mistake [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3548.44s)]
*  and would you do it again? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3550.96s)]
*  And again, he gives a completely evasive [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3552.16s)]
*  $40 billion loss and he can't say it's a bad idea. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3554.28s)]
*  Can't say it's a bad idea. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3557.48s)]
*  And what's crazy is that literally that exact same week, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3558.72s)]
*  and I can't believe I feel bad for Dylan [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3562.16s)]
*  in this whole thing because Dylan essentially comes out [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3564.3199999999997s)]
*  and says, hey, if you can't stand by like a transgender [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3567.12s)]
*  person, then don't do the campaign. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3570.8399999999997s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3572.36s)]
*  That's worse than not hiring somebody at all, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3573.52s)]
*  but like just don't do it. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3574.88s)]
*  And so Dylan essentially said it was a mistake [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3576.3199999999997s)]
*  because they couldn't stand by it. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3578.36s)]
*  Larry Think that week at the Aspen Ideas Festival says, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3579.92s)]
*  I'm not using the term ESG anymore because it's become [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3582.6s)]
*  too controversial and it's lost its meaning. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3585.62s)]
*  And you have this now CEO of one of the most iconic companies [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3588.12s)]
*  in the United States and Heiser-Busch [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3592.1200000000003s)]
*  can't make a direct response about a campaign [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3593.32s)]
*  that has cost this company billions of dollars, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3595.7200000000003s)]
*  millions of customers. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3598.0s)]
*  They had to fire thousands of employees after this. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3599.08s)]
*  Suppliers shut down. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3601.76s)]
*  But not the CIA guy. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3602.7200000000003s)]
*  He kept his job. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3603.8s)]
*  But he's kept his job still. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3604.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, he's still kept his job. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3605.8s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3606.6400000000003s)]
*  Like where's, does the company have a board? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3607.48s)]
*  Well, there's a problem, but it's a European based board. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3609.86s)]
*  So it's based over in Europe. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3612.32s)]
*  It's based in Belgium. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3614.04s)]
*  They still abide by a lot of these different philosophy. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3615.2000000000003s)]
*  And this is where we're coming into an issue. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3618.08s)]
*  So what's the point of having a head of the company, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3619.92s)]
*  a president of the company? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3622.2000000000003s)]
*  If you're just gonna be a puppet, that's the problem. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3623.28s)]
*  And that's where I almost think that for a lot of companies, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3625.16s)]
*  I think, and as specifically, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3627.52s)]
*  I think their company's actually better off [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3629.16s)]
*  probably selling its US business unit at this point. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3630.7200000000003s)]
*  Because I don't think you can serve this Europe. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3633.32s)]
*  But it's so damaged. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3635.32s)]
*  Well, it is, but I think people love [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3636.96s)]
*  a great American comeback story. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3638.88s)]
*  I agree. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3640.32s)]
*  They do. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3641.16s)]
*  But to make that story, you have to admit again [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3641.98s)]
*  that there was a mistake and that you screwed up [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3644.36s)]
*  and that you've taken accountability for it [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3646.4s)]
*  and that we now have a different plan. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3648.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter how much money the company [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3649.4s)]
*  has subsequently spent on, I mean, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3651.4s)]
*  it's $100 million for Dana White and the UFC. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3653.8s)]
*  They've hired Shane Gillis. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3656.04s)]
*  They've hired Peyton Manning. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3657.52s)]
*  They've done all these things [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3659.04s)]
*  to try and get their customer back. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3660.08s)]
*  But all the customer wants is like, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3661.48s)]
*  guys, I say you screwed up. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3662.56s)]
*  One of the greatest changes of the past six months [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3663.88s)]
*  is you can finally say loud and proud [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3666.2000000000003s)]
*  without the threat of going to jail for it [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3668.44s)]
*  that you're for babies, you're for the unborn. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3670.36s)]
*  And that's great news for PreBorn, our partner, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3673.56s)]
*  which operates a clinic network across the United States. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3675.84s)]
*  PreBorn is the single greatest threat [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3678.88s)]
*  to the abortion industry. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3680.92s)]
*  It's rescued over 67,000 babies last year alone. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3681.92s)]
*  These abortions still claim thousands of lives every year. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3686.96s)]
*  It's one of the great tragedies unspoken most of the time. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3690.52s)]
*  It's not a right, it is a tragedy. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3693.76s)]
*  So the goal is to rescue all of these babies. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3696.12s)]
*  They need your help to do that. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3698.52s)]
*  Assisting and providing ultrasounds is a great place [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3699.96s)]
*  to start more knowledge, more information [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3702.12s)]
*  for expecting mothers. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3704.2400000000002s)]
*  It really makes a huge difference. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3705.7200000000003s)]
*  Once a mother realizes that the lump in her belly [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3707.76s)]
*  is a baby as a child, she becomes twice as likely [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3711.5200000000004s)]
*  to choose life, to let that child live. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3714.7200000000003s)]
*  One ultrasound costs only 28 bucks, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3717.0400000000004s)]
*  meaning that five are just $140. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3719.8s)]
*  So $5,000 is good for enough devices [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3722.6000000000004s)]
*  to cover PreBorn's entire network for a full day. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3725.48s)]
*  It really, really helps. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3729.0400000000004s)]
*  We hope you'll join this cause. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3730.0800000000004s)]
*  Dial pound 250, say the keyword baby. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3731.92s)]
*  That's pound 250, the word baby, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3734.84s)]
*  or you can visit preborn.com slash Tucker [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3737.6800000000003s)]

*  I mean, I knew, you know, former head of that company [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3747.08s)]
*  pretty well, wonderful man. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3750.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's probably still as true as of last year. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3752.88s)]
*  You know, he doesn't run the company anymore, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3754.96s)]
*  as August Bush. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3757.44s)]
*  August Bush III? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3758.48s)]
*  Yeah, August III. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3759.32s)]
*  What are the best meetings I've ever been [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3760.1600000000003s)]
*  in my entire life? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3761.48s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3762.32s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3763.1400000000003s)]
*  I can tell stories. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3764.46s)]
*  But yeah, he's an unbelievable person. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3765.3s)]
*  But he, and this may be true today, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3766.82s)]
*  he's an older man, mid 80s anyway, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3769.66s)]
*  but he was still tasting Budweiser beer every single week. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3771.98s)]
*  They sent him every single US product and he tastes it. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3775.58s)]
*  He's one of six or seven, you know this [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3779.82s)]
*  cause you work there. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3781.14s)]
*  And the people who founded that company, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3782.42s)]
*  that family, you could say a lot of things [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3784.3s)]
*  about the family and this big fractious family [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3786.58s)]
*  with all kinds of stories, but they all love beer. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3788.7s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3791.7s)]
*  Like they truly love beer. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3792.54s)]
*  They drink their beers. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3794.2599999999998s)]
*  Like they think that Bud Light's an amazing beer [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3795.1s)]
*  and they think, you know, Bud Heavy's a great beer. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3796.7799999999997s)]
*  Like they're into the product. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3798.94s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3800.94s)]
*  And it just feels like that's a, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3801.7799999999997s)]
*  I use Alp from the second I wake up [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3803.8599999999997s)]
*  to the second I go to bed. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3805.38s)]
*  That's why we own the company cause I love it. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3806.8199999999997s)]
*  And I think if you don't have that spirit, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3810.16s)]
*  if the head of Philip Morris doesn't even smoke [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3813.94s)]
*  Marlboro Reds, get out. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3815.68s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3817.66s)]
*  If you're embarrassed of what you do, don't do it. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3818.5s)]
*  I completely agree. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3820.54s)]
*  I mean, the Budweiser, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3821.3599999999997s)]
*  they said they almost had Budweiser in their veins. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3822.7s)]
*  I think there was a whole story that when you're born, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3824.22s)]
*  they let you give you a thimble of Budweiser. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3826.1s)]
*  The first thing I think you drink. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3827.9399999999996s)]
*  And if you've got a problem with it, don't work there. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3829.2599999999998s)]
*  That's it. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3831.18s)]
*  I don't, why is that hard? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3832.02s)]
*  If you go to church and like the priest is like, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3833.66s)]
*  well, actually I'm an atheist. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3835.4199999999996s)]
*  It's like, okay, I'm not saying you should go to jail [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3836.3799999999997s)]
*  for atheism, but I don't think you should be preaching [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3838.2s)]
*  in a church. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3840.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, shouldn't be here. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3841.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3842.02s)]
*  So I completely agree. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3842.8599999999997s)]
*  And I think that's one of the problems that we have [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3843.7s)]
*  is that even here in the, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3845.16s)]
*  and there's a bunch of other brands as well. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3846.5s)]
*  I mean, like Jeep's another great one. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3847.74s)]
*  Jeep's owned by now Stellantis, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3849.42s)]
*  which is based over in the Netherlands. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3850.82s)]
*  And you're talking about, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3852.38s)]
*  man, if you're going to have American brand like Jeep, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3853.2200000000003s)]
*  should that really be owned by the Europeans? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3855.5s)]
*  If they just have a completely different [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3857.2200000000003s)]
*  philosophical system and they just have the European [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3858.42s)]
*  mindset, this is very different. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3861.02s)]
*  Like tiny little electric cars, little gay cars. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3861.86s)]
*  It's so weird. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3864.98s)]
*  You might be seeing a little mini Jeep. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3866.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3867.86s)]
*  I have an eight year old daughter. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3868.82s)]
*  She used to have one of those like Barbie Jeeps. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3869.86s)]
*  That's probably one. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3871.62s)]
*  Little big Jeep, little Stonewall Jeep. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3872.46s)]
*  No, it's like, that's fine. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3874.42s)]
*  Go make a Stonewall Jeep if you want, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3878.06s)]
*  but like there should be just like a regular Jeep too. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3879.46s)]
*  Yeah, and that's okay. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3881.7799999999997s)]
*  And give that customer that regular Jeep as well. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3882.9s)]
*  And so, I don't know, this is where I think also [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3885.22s)]
*  these companies also need to go to. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3888.1s)]
*  I actually think another company that's done [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3889.62s)]
*  like a pretty good job of navigating [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3890.9s)]
*  a lot of the cultural wars. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3892.54s)]
*  It's actually Netflix, a lot of credit. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3894.3399999999997s)]
*  If you remember, there was two or three years ago, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3896.62s)]
*  Netflix getting a lot of pressure to cancel Dave Chappelle. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3899.06s)]
*  Remember when there was this Dave Chappelle special? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3901.18s)]
*  Well, they wanted to cancel Dave Chappelle. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3902.86s)]
*  Well, a lot of other people wanted to cancel Dave Chappelle [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3904.42s)]
*  because he had jokes about the LGBTQ, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3907.6600000000003s)]
*  and a million other communities, by the way. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3909.82s)]
*  I mean, Dave Chappelle doesn't leave anybody unscathed. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3911.06s)]
*  And there was a lot of pressure. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3913.1400000000003s)]
*  He was tough on the trans thing though. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3914.5s)]
*  He's like, this is not right. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3915.82s)]
*  I mean, he like, he wasn't just mocking. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3918.06s)]
*  He was like, men cannot become women, period, sorry. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3921.38s)]
*  I'm a Muslim, I'm not doing this. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3924.1s)]
*  But you know, that's, hey, it's freedom of speech [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3925.58s)]
*  in the country. I agree. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3927.5s)]
*  No, I'm 100% Dave Chappelle side. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3928.34s)]
*  I'm just saying, it was more than just a joke. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3929.94s)]
*  He was serious about it, I think. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3933.34s)]
*  But the thing I at least give Netflix credit for, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3935.1s)]
*  is when all of this was going on, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3937.38s)]
*  they were told to cancel Chappelle, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3938.82s)]
*  they came out with this Culture of Excellence document. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3939.78s)]
*  And this Culture of Excellence document essentially said, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3941.94s)]
*  we are not going to censor artists at Netflix. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3944.1400000000003s)]
*  We are gonna put out content for liberals, conservatives, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3946.94s)]
*  whatever, you kind of name it, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3950.58s)]
*  and people will watch whatever they wanna watch. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3951.7000000000003s)]
*  But we are not gonna censor it at Netflix. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3953.34s)]
*  And if you have an issue with that, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3955.58s)]
*  then go work somewhere else. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3956.7000000000003s)]
*  And I actually give Netflix a lot of credit for that [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3958.46s)]
*  because they're based in California and everything else. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3959.82s)]
*  And that's great. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3961.86s)]
*  They employ the Obamas. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3962.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3964.06s)]
*  They'll play that, but then also, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3965.38s)]
*  well, I guess it was Amazon that picked up [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3966.9s)]
*  the Melania Trump deal, but great, like put it all out there. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3968.3s)]
*  I mean, who cares? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3971.1800000000003s)]
*  America's watch whatever they want. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3972.02s)]
*  And so I give them a lot of credit for that. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3973.06s)]
*  I think that that's also where Anne Husserbush [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3975.42s)]
*  kind of needs to go as well, is to say, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3977.46s)]
*  listen, we have a whole portfolio of beers. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3978.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, hell, we have King Cobra 40 ounce bottles [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3980.34s)]
*  that is for a certain person. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3982.38s)]
*  But then we also have craft breweries like Goose Island. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3984.6600000000003s)]
*  So they make King Cobra 40s. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3987.1400000000003s)]
*  And again, I don't drink, I'm opposed to alcohol, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3989.54s)]
*  but I love that I live in a country [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3991.94s)]
*  that still makes King Cobra 40s. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3993.54s)]
*  I do, I do, I can't help it. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3994.98s)]
*  And I assume that is, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3996.66s)]
*  I assume they weren't pushing Dylan Mulvaney [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=3999.34s)]
*  on King Cobra drinkers. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4001.06s)]
*  No, they were not putting it on King Key. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4002.58s)]
*  That's the way they were not doing it. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4003.94s)]
*  That would be hilarious. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4004.78s)]
*  That would be hilarious. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4005.62s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4006.46s)]
*  Maybe they should, maybe that would be amazing. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4007.3s)]
*  That'd be amazing, bring that back. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4008.66s)]
*  That would be, can you imagine? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4009.9s)]
*  A pinup of Dylan Mulvaney on a King Cobra 40 ounce. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4010.74s)]
*  If Alyssa Schopenhauer or whatever her name is, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4014.18s)]
*  I think King Cobra drinkers are out of touch. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4017.02s)]
*  That would take some balls. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4020.34s)]
*  Yeah, that would, that'd be amazing. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4021.34s)]
*  That would take some balls. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4022.46s)]
*  That'd take some balls. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4023.3s)]
*  So yeah, but they also have Goose Island. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4024.6200000000003s)]
*  And Goose Island in Chicago, they have a Sounds Queer, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4026.42s)]

*  for this company in its latest round. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4073.66s)]

*  I do some consumer investing. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4077.62s)]

*  a three billion dollar company. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4090.9399999999996s)]
*  You did that great, you got me wrong. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4091.7799999999997s)]

*  Again, they are not sponsors of this show, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4095.14s)]
*  but he's totally focused on the product. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4097.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4100.74s)]
*  Like he just thinks it's the best product ever. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4101.58s)]
*  He just thinks it's amazing and he's right, it is. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4102.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's great product. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4105.299999999999s)]
*  It tastes just like regular beer. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4106.219999999999s)]
*  I think it's better than, well, I haven't had a beer [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4107.62s)]
*  in a while, but it's really good. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4109.62s)]
*  I had four at dinner the other night. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4111.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're great. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4113.58s)]
*  Which ones do you have? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4114.42s)]
*  The product good for me. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4115.259999999999s)]

*  one was called Tucker actually. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4119.42s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4121.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was a wheat beer. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4121.9s)]
*  It was the least good, but they were all, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4122.86s)]
*  yeah, they were amazing. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4124.74s)]
*  Yeah, and it's opened up what, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4126.299999999999s)]
*  it's non-alcoholic beer, you see. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4127.5s)]
*  I mean, it was terrible. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4129.259999999999s)]
*  And they're really like, never had one. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4130.259999999999s)]
*  I never had one, it was so bad. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4131.099999999999s)]
*  It was kind of a joke. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4132.86s)]
*  Now that feels like a Dylan Mulvaney segment. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4134.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4136.34s)]
*  Like go ahead, Dylan, you love it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4137.18s)]
*  That's what it was. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4138.58s)]
*  That was essentially what non-alcoholic beer was. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4139.42s)]
*  And he totally just reframed what it can be, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4141.46s)]
*  where it can be good, cool, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4144.02s)]
*  you have it after a run, you feel better. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4145.7s)]
*  Like actually delicious. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4147.3s)]
*  Actually delicious. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4148.54s)]
*  And there's this whole movement now. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4149.38s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4150.42s)]
*  Even though I'm categorized a millennial, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4152.900000000001s)]
*  I like to identify as the greatest generation here, Tucker, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4155.22s)]
*  but I think I'm categorized as a millennial. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4157.34s)]
*  But my cohort, I think 80% of us used to drink alcohol [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4160.58s)]
*  when we were in our 20s. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4163.0599999999995s)]
*  And now that Gen Z is in their 20s, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4164.34s)]
*  only 60% of them is drinking alcohol at this point. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4167.34s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4169.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes, I mean, there's been a massive drop off [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4169.86s)]
*  in the number of people drinking alcohol. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4171.38s)]
*  And then across all cohorts, Gen Z, millennial, Gen X, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4172.34s)]
*  boomers, everyone's generally drinking less also, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4175.5s)]
*  because people are just becoming more health conscious. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4177.82s)]
*  So he's doing a great job of picking up a lot of those [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4179.66s)]
*  people that still like the taste of beer [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4181.34s)]
*  or the occasion of beer, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4183.0199999999995s)]
*  but they just don't want to drink a six pack of beer [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4184.46s)]
*  and feel like trash. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4186.74s)]
*  Look at how good hops are. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4187.58s)]
*  Yeah, they're great. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4188.86s)]
*  They're amazing. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4189.74s)]
*  And hops exist for a lot of reasons, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4190.66s)]
*  but one is to counterbalance the taste of alcohol, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4193.26s)]
*  because alcohol does not taste good. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4195.0599999999995s)]
*  You take the alcohol out, the hops just, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4196.82s)]
*  pardon the pun, flower into this amazing, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4199.42s)]
*  now I'm getting very out of control, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4203.099999999999s)]
*  but like this bouquet of flavor. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4205.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're right. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4207.099999999999s)]
*  I'm getting very Delamovani now, but like, yeah. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4208.94s)]
*  And actually beer compliments food [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4210.34s)]
*  a lot better than wine does, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4211.7s)]
*  because it's so diverse. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4213.139999999999s)]
*  Because you have lagers and porters and stouts and IPAs, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4214.46s)]
*  usually with wines, you're kind of red and white, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4217.46s)]
*  and that's about it. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4218.98s)]
*  But there it actually does a much better job with food. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4220.259999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen Alyssa Schopenhauer [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4221.94s)]
*  or whatever her name is, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4225.099999999999s)]
*  Alyssa German name from Harvard, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4226.179999999999s)]
*  and then CIA guy CEO, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4227.86s)]
*  have you ever seen them drink beer at lunch? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4229.259999999999s)]
*  Probably not at lunch. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4232.299999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4233.66s)]
*  I feel, but it was more of like a, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4234.48s)]
*  he would drink Budweiser like here and there, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4237.139999999999s)]
*  maybe one or so, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4238.86s)]
*  but I think he was much more into the muscle milk [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4239.7s)]
*  and that was kind of his thing. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4242.0199999999995s)]
*  So. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4244.0199999999995s)]
*  Come on now. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4244.86s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4245.7s)]
*  And again, it's, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4246.66s)]
*  Brandon should have been more courageous. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4248.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4251.26s)]
*  Like the guy, he took a company [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4252.099999999999s)]
*  that was doing $6 billion of profits [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4253.099999999999s)]
*  and now doing 4 billion of profits. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4254.62s)]
*  I mean, just there, you've lost $2 billion. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4255.86s)]
*  We're still here. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4258.34s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4259.18s)]
*  I, what is, what is that? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4260.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's just- [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4262.44s)]
*  Oh, you say like, okay, he's a puppet. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4263.28s)]
*  He's clearly a puppet and he's terrified. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4264.58s)]
*  And I, again, I don't mean to attack him personally, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4266.26s)]
*  though of course I am, but sure he's not a bad guy. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4268.42s)]
*  I'm sure his wife and kids like him, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4270.78s)]
*  but it does seem like the people pulling his puppet strings, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4272.06s)]
*  that's obviously true. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4278.3s)]
*  They have an interest in making money. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4279.740000000001s)]
*  Like I don't understand the total lack of accountability [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4281.160000000001s)]
*  in corporate America. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4283.72s)]
*  Like no one's ever fired it. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4284.56s)]
*  It's like the US military. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4286.52s)]
*  Well, but I think this is this part of it. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4287.46s)]
*  Again, when you're controlling this European corporation, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4288.700000000001s)]
*  I think they're doing a good thing [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4290.42s)]
*  by trying to get involved [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4291.46s)]
*  in pushing more of the political issues. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4292.64s)]
*  Also, I think there's something to be said is that [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4294.700000000001s)]
*  when you reach a certain level of wealth and money [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4295.9800000000005s)]
*  in your billionaire type class, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4298.400000000001s)]
*  you want to be part of the right social circle. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4300.54s)]
*  It doesn't actually matter to you. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4302.5s)]
*  That's it. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4303.9s)]
*  And I think that's part of it because the whole company [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4304.74s)]
*  is more controlled by these Belgian families [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4306.22s)]
*  and a couple of Brazilian families as well. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4308.34s)]
*  And now their kids are on the board. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4309.82s)]
*  And I think it's just being in the right social circle. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4311.3s)]
*  I bet their kids are pretty great, right? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4313.14s)]
*  I've never met them. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4314.9s)]
*  Billionaire kids. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4315.74s)]
*  Let's put some billionaire kids on the board. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4317.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4319.54s)]
*  Let's get James Murdoch on the board. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4320.38s)]
*  That's it. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4321.54s)]
*  He's a genius. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4322.38s)]
*  So this is the bigger issue. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4323.22s)]
*  And then what's even funny about Brendan, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4325.14s)]
*  I mean, you almost feel bad for Brendan [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4326.7s)]
*  because Kid Rock actually went on a Rogan show [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4329.58s)]
*  and essentially he had a big conversation [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4331.82s)]
*  with Brendan as well. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4334.0199999999995s)]
*  And he was talking about how he's, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4335.18s)]
*  Kid Rock was making fun of him [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4337.26s)]
*  for the whole CBS interview he did. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4338.7s)]
*  He was like, I don't get it, man. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4340.54s)]
*  Like, why did you just get up there [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4341.42s)]
*  and you were like a puppet? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4342.46s)]
*  And essentially this Kid Rock's words [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4343.42s)]
*  and telling the story was like, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4345.34s)]
*  Brendan said he was coached. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4346.62s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I was coached. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4347.46s)]
*  I had to say what I had to say. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4348.3s)]
*  Like that's what's problematic. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4349.5s)]
*  And again, this is where you come back to this fundamental [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4350.82s)]
*  just like disconnect between the American sort of way [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4352.66s)]
*  and American business and the European way. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4355.76s)]
*  He was essentially coached by the board. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4357.46s)]
*  No one is served. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4358.66s)]
*  So you have to ask like, what actually is this? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4359.58s)]
*  So the company is not served. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4362.1s)]
*  Its employees are not served. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4363.38s)]
*  Its consumers are not served. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4365.0s)]
*  Poor Brendan, who's just like a hapless bystander [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4366.46s)]
*  to his own life, guzzling mussel milk [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4368.54s)]
*  and hitting the elliptical. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4370.74s)]
*  He's not, he's humiliated. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4372.26s)]
*  And then the shareholders lose $2 billion a year. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4374.42s)]
*  So like, who is winning here? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4376.58s)]
*  And you've got to think that maybe this is part [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4379.5s)]
*  of a bigger play to destroy the West. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4381.62s)]
*  I mean, I think- [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4384.1s)]
*  Throwing that out there. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4384.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, who's winning? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4385.78s)]
*  It's again, I think a lot of the board members who- [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4386.62s)]
*  China's winning. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4388.82s)]
*  China's probably winning in this thing. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4389.66s)]
*  I don't know if this is like as much of a, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4391.86s)]
*  China is winning. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4393.42s)]
*  I don't know if they have much to do with this. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4394.26s)]
*  I think it's more of this, again, out of touch. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4395.099999999999s)]
*  But all this stuff, the Black Lives Matter [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4396.94s)]
*  helped zero black people [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4398.5s)]
*  except the ones who stole the money from Apple. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4399.62s)]
*  Except the big lavish mansions that were built with- [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4401.86s)]
*  Exactly, no, but it didn't help black people. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4403.46s)]
*  I'm all for helping everybody, okay? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4405.0199999999995s)]
*  But it didn't help black people. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4407.18s)]
*  It didn't help Kenosha, Wisconsin, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4408.78s)]
*  which is destroyed and never will be rebuilt. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4411.46s)]
*  Didn't help all the Hispanic families who live in Kenosha. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4413.22s)]
*  It didn't help anybody, actually. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4415.74s)]
*  It didn't help anybody. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4419.22s)]
*  Trans, how many happy trans people are there? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4420.62s)]
*  Zero. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4423.3s)]
*  That does not help, actually. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4424.139999999999s)]
*  It just denies people grandchildren. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4426.099999999999s)]
*  It's, I don't know. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4428.74s)]
*  It's hard to see who the winners are. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4430.5s)]
*  Like in an armed robbery, there's the victim. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4431.82s)]
*  There's a liquor store owner. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4434.78s)]
*  Okay, he gets shot. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4436.179999999999s)]
*  But then the guy who takes his money gets the money. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4437.66s)]
*  So he wins. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4440.26s)]
*  So like, I'm not endorsing that, of course, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4441.22s)]
*  but there's a logic to it. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4443.0199999999995s)]
*  But some of the biggest social trends in the United States [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4445.5s)]
*  don't seem to have any winners. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4447.9s)]
*  And that freaks me out. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4450.18s)]
*  Well, but again, but I think the winners [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4451.54s)]
*  are more the Chinas, the Russians, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4452.9800000000005s)]
*  the big picture. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4455.18s)]
*  The Europe, et cetera. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4456.02s)]
*  Because if you almost think about it, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4457.42s)]
*  I mentioned this earlier, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4458.94s)]
*  but the US was always exceptional. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4459.78s)]
*  It's always been this city upon a hill [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4461.82s)]
*  that people are good with. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4463.02s)]
*  It's always been unique and distinct and different. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4463.86s)]
*  And there have been, you know, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4465.74s)]
*  it's always been radical ideas in the United States [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4466.82s)]
*  to have free speech and American capitalism [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4468.74s)]
*  and freedom of religion. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4471.3s)]
*  These have all been radical ideas for a long time. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4472.46s)]
*  And that's allowed us to become the most successful, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4474.86s)]
*  prosperous, you name it, country. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4476.339999999999s)]
*  And I think that there's been ways [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4477.78s)]
*  that sort of the Europeans, the Chinese, others, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4479.46s)]
*  they've been able to infiltrate that [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4482.0199999999995s)]
*  and try and rebalance. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4483.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, going into the so-called [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4484.179999999999s)]
*  oppressor versus oppressed framework. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4486.099999999999s)]
*  Like for the rest of the world, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4487.78s)]
*  this US was always this oppressor type country. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4488.86s)]
*  We're always oppressed. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4492.5s)]
*  How do you rebalance? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4493.339999999999s)]
*  Well, you try and social engineer. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4494.74s)]
*  You try and- [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4496.38s)]
*  You get the country to kill itself. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4497.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the way that, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4498.42s)]
*  that's essentially the way that you do it. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4499.339999999999s)]
*  It doesn't seem that way if you're thinking long-term. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4500.62s)]
*  By the way, I don't mean to blame China. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4502.7s)]
*  I don't hate China. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4505.3s)]
*  I respect China. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4506.14s)]
*  And they're acting in what they think is their own interest, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4507.9s)]
*  which I think is what countries ought to do. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4509.7s)]
*  But I'm not blaming them for, you know, Melissa Schopenhauer [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4511.78s)]
*  or whatever her name is, Alyssa. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4518.9s)]
*  I'm just gonna let you just keep going. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4520.34s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4521.5s)]
*  Because I love everyone. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4522.34s)]
*  Everyone's great. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4523.18s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4524.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna correct it all. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4525.7s)]
*  The German lady from Harvard, the CIA guy [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4526.54s)]
*  who drinks muscle milk. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4528.54s)]
*  I'm not blaming China for their personal inadequacies, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4529.54s)]
*  their mediocrity, whatever, that's their fault. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4533.58s)]
*  But big picture, like it's just, like, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4535.22s)]
*  what is going on here? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4538.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so I think that is what's going on [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4539.54s)]
*  is that you have, obviously, you know, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4541.98s)]
*  governments that are antagonists [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4543.9s)]
*  towards the United States are trying to, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4546.34s)]
*  you know, China, Europe, et cetera, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4548.26s)]
*  trying to kind of pull us back, tear us down. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4549.82s)]
*  But even a lot of these other, you know, companies as well, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4551.86s)]
*  unfortunately, just have a different view [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4555.38s)]
*  of what business should be. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4556.7s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be good [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4558.900000000001s)]
*  for the business units in the US. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4560.46s)]
*  It's bad for everybody. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4562.06s)]
*  I was with someone the other day [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4563.26s)]
*  who knows Larry Fink really well, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4564.700000000001s)]
*  and I said, boy, I think Larry Fink [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4566.26s)]
*  has really been damaging to the country, to the world. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4569.1s)]
*  And this person said, you know, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4572.02s)]
*  I feel sorry for Larry Fink. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4573.42s)]
*  Why? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4574.46s)]
*  Why do you feel sorry for Larry Fink? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4575.3s)]
*  He's the single unhappiest person I've ever met. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4576.14s)]
*  I'm not surprised by that. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4578.780000000001s)]
*  It's so weird. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4580.1s)]
*  Like, what's the point in making billions of dollars [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4580.9400000000005s)]
*  if you're miserable? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4583.38s)]
*  But here's the thing, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4584.22s)]
*  because he doesn't have any principles. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4585.06s)]
*  Because if you take a look at BlackRock, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4585.88s)]
*  it's just been blowing in the wind [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4587.0199999999995s)]
*  over the last couple of years. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4588.179999999999s)]
*  When it was all about the ESG and stakeholder capitals, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4589.7s)]
*  and we're gonna hold that flag and we're gonna carry it. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4593.099999999999s)]
*  But then as soon as people just, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4594.94s)]
*  with first principles, thinking about saying, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4595.98s)]
*  guys, you're violating your fiduciary obligation [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4597.62s)]
*  because I just asked you to make money for me [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4599.419999999999s)]
*  and not do social engineering policies [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4601.459999999999s)]
*  that are losing money for me. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4603.139999999999s)]
*  And so when all of a sudden [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4604.66s)]
*  people started pulling their money from them, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4605.48s)]
*  they got pulled in front of Congress [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4606.94s)]
*  by a bunch of politicians. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4609.0199999999995s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, Larry Fink is backing away, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4610.62s)]
*  says, I don't see ESG anymore. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4612.0599999999995s)]
*  He pulled DEI off their website [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4613.9s)]
*  over the last couple of days. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4615.66s)]
*  So in the United States, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4617.02s)]
*  the hostility you feel from someone like Larry Fink [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4617.86s)]
*  toward the US is unmistakable. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4620.7s)]
*  It's like you're mad at the United States, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4622.86s)]
*  but you're American, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4624.7s)]
*  and you can only have done what you did in this country [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4625.66s)]
*  with all of our legal protections [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4628.9s)]
*  and all the freedoms that you have. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4630.62s)]
*  Why declare war on your own country? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4632.38s)]
*  And they all have. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4634.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4635.3s)]
*  It's just because he's, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4636.14s)]
*  he lines his own pockets along the way. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4636.96s)]
*  I guess, but there are lots of people [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4638.42s)]
*  who can be rich and patriotic too. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4639.66s)]
*  You could even, I don't know, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4640.98s)]
*  be unscrupulous in business and be patriotic. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4642.86s)]
*  You used to work at Fox in New York. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4645.18s)]
*  There are a lot of people that literally say, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4647.860000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say I worked in Fox. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4649.860000000001s)]
*  Who's Kat Timp? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4651.38s)]
*  She's been, she used to tell people [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4652.780000000001s)]
*  she worked in the porn industry [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4654.9800000000005s)]
*  instead of saying Fox News in New York City. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4656.18s)]
*  She said- [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4658.860000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna comment on that. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4659.700000000001s)]
*  But I think especially when you're in New York, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4661.54s)]
*  if you wanna go to the right schools [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4663.46s)]
*  and go to the right parties [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4664.820000000001s)]
*  and get your kids into this and that, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4665.740000000001s)]
*  you can't be patriotic in a lot of cases. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4667.14s)]
*  I know. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4669.38s)]
*  And you can't stand up. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4670.22s)]
*  Of course. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4671.04s)]
*  And I don't mean to single out Larry Fink. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4671.88s)]
*  It sounds like he needs our prayers, not our scorn. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4673.02s)]
*  But it's that whole leadership class, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4675.3s)]
*  which is so angry, going back to, you know, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4678.68s)]
*  Melissa Hindenburg or whatever her name is. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4682.96s)]
*  I heard the Hindenburg one. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4685.02s)]
*  Sorry, whatever. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4687.42s)]
*  German girl from Harvard. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4688.9400000000005s)]
*  I can't believe that hasn't been picked up, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4690.06s)]
*  Melissa, the Hindenburg ones. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4691.620000000001s)]
*  I haven't heard that one. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4693.06s)]
*  No, I was thinking of Paul von Hindenburg, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4693.900000000001s)]
*  not the Blin. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4695.820000000001s)]
*  I thought you were thinking of the Blin. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4696.660000000001s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4697.5s)]
*  The last president of Germany. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4698.34s)]
*  The one who handed it to the Nazis, actually. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4700.3s)]
*  No, people like that, and it's not just her. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4703.660000000001s)]
*  Of course it's an entire class of people who, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4706.46s)]
*  I've lived around my whole life, I know them, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4708.34s)]

*  And it's like, what did America ever do to you, actually? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4716.740000000001s)]
*  Gave you a ton of opportunity you made [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4719.540000000001s)]

*  But they all feel that way. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4727.26s)]
*  No, I agree. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4729.320000000001s)]
*  It's almost, you have to be apologetic [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4730.160000000001s)]
*  about being here and enjoying the freedom. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4732.56s)]
*  But they work to undermine it. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4733.88s)]
*  They work to wreck it. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4735.360000000001s)]
*  What's America? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4736.92s)]
*  It's a meritocracy. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4737.76s)]
*  That's the whole promise of immigration, by the way. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4739.120000000001s)]
*  Immigration only works with a meritocracy. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4740.68s)]
*  The smartest, most ambitious, fairest, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4743.76s)]
*  most decent people around the world get to move here [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4746.34s)]

*  Okay, everyone's for that. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4749.76s)]

*  You can't do that. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4756.52s)]
*  Yeah, the greatest asset that we have in this country, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4757.4800000000005s)]
*  it is the American dream. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4760.96s)]
*  That is the greatest asset why people wanna move here, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4762.88s)]
*  why people wanna invest here, why people wanna be here. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4765.12s)]

*  that wanna tear down that American dream. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4769.12s)]
*  They wanna make you feel like it's not real. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4770.36s)]
*  But they're all Americans who want to. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4771.2s)]
*  I just find it so strange if they took [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4772.66s)]
*  that destructive energy and focused it [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4776.2s)]
*  on our actual enemies, whoever those might be, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4778.04s)]

*  That stuff is more dangerous than nuclear weapons. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4782.48s)]
*  Well, I think the pendulum's swinging back. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4784.8s)]

*  it's been amazing to see what's happened [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4789.5s)]
*  in Silicon Valley over the last year or two. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4790.48s)]
*  For sure, I agree. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4792.48s)]

*  or whatever his relationship is, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4806.5199999999995s)]
*  companies that make things, physical things. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4808.28s)]
*  That's why it's so sad to see it happen to AB [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4810.5599999999995s)]
*  because it's like they actually make a product [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4812.32s)]
*  you can hold in your hand. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4814.16s)]
*  And it's a great product. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4815.28s)]
*  And whether you like alcohol or not like alcohol, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4817.28s)]
*  Budweiser to some degree was the American treatment [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4819.08s)]
*  of bottle. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4820.76s)]
*  This is the famous Budweiser beer. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4821.6s)]
*  We know of no other beer that costs so much to ruin age [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4823.24s)]
*  or exclusive beachwood aging produces a taste, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4825.4s)]
*  drinkability, you will find it no other beer at any price. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4827.48s)]
*  You gotta be the only person who hasn't drank a beer [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4830.2s)]
*  in 25 years that can recite that up from the bottle. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4831.84s)]
*  That's how much beer I drink. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4833.68s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4834.5199999999995s)]
*  For me it was always a breakfast beverage. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4836.36s)]
*  I was never, I probably should have worked there [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4838.72s)]
*  because I was never embarrassed. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4840.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think Kevin Ike was drinking [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4842.2s)]
*  but I was never embarrassed to drink in the morning, ever. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4843.72s)]
*  It never even occurred to me. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4847.0s)]
*  I just grew up in a different world. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4848.0s)]
*  And I always have felt my whole life. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4849.84s)]
*  Breakfast champions back in the day. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4851.68s)]
*  If you're embarrassed to do something, don't do it. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4852.96s)]
*  And so I was never embarrassed. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4855.08s)]
*  Like I'd like a beer, please. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4856.08s)]
*  I'd like a Bud Tall Boy, like a Bud Tall Boy for breakfast [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4857.44s)]
*  with French toast, you know what I mean? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4859.68s)]
*  Just kind of get you an even keel. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4860.92s)]
*  And I've never had a Bud Light in my life. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4862.88s)]
*  But I did think that Budweiser was like [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4865.36s)]
*  a pretty serviceable beer. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4867.56s)]
*  It was a great beer, very serviceable beer, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4869.12s)]
*  great sort of Americana beer. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4870.92s)]
*  And again, the history of the company is amazing. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4873.36s)]
*  It's almost intertwined with the history of the United States. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4875.68s)]
*  It really started before the Civil War, which is crazy. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4877.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4879.5599999999995s)]
*  And then it was a huge supporter in World War I, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4880.4s)]
*  World War II, have Folds of Honor Foundation. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4881.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, hires thousands of veterans. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4884.36s)]
*  And so I get more long-term, I want the company to get back. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4886.679999999999s)]
*  I want the company to survive. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4889.5599999999995s)]
*  And it was intertwined with American political [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4890.4s)]
*  and labor history. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4891.4s)]
*  I mean, August Bush III, who is still alive, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4892.44s)]
*  knew Jimmy Hoffa. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4896.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4898.08s)]
*  Not like post-prison get murdered Jimmy Hoffa, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4899.28s)]
*  but like labor leader Jimmy Hoffa. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4901.759999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4903.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, this was at the center. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4904.679999999999s)]
*  There was a huge employer. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4906.12s)]
*  It was a builder of the middle class in this country. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4908.0s)]
*  They built this distribution network, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4910.28s)]
*  a 500 independent family owned wholesalers [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4911.64s)]
*  across the country, which are amazing. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4913.64s)]
*  And all those families got rich. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4915.44s)]
*  Yeah, and then everyone did incredibly well. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4916.88s)]
*  And so, I mean, more broadly, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4918.96s)]
*  and I know a lot of the wholesalers, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4921.36s)]
*  and they're all upset about what happened [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4922.5599999999995s)]
*  the last couple of years, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4923.64s)]
*  because they lost tons of their business. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4924.48s)]
*  They had to fire a lot of employees. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4925.84s)]
*  But CIA guys still has this job? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4926.68s)]
*  Yes, which is crazy. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4927.88s)]
*  And it's even funny as well. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4929.0s)]
*  So this year he tried to, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4930.32s)]
*  you know how beer on menus usually says domestic or import? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4932.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4935.24s)]
*  So he tried to reframe domestic beer as American beer, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4937.04s)]
*  which sounds like a great idea, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4939.12s)]
*  but if you're not an American owned company, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4940.5199999999995s)]
*  where do you put in as a Bush? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4942.88s)]
*  Do you put them on the American beer or on the import beer? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4943.96s)]
*  A lot of times the import, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4947.0s)]
*  and I think that's one of the reasons [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4947.88s)]
*  they should actually either sell it back to the Bush family [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4948.8s)]
*  or sell it back to Warren Buffett. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4950.84s)]
*  You know, I think it was, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4952.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't have any special knowledge beyond what's obvious, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4953.5599999999995s)]
*  but I think the problem with these family held companies, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4955.8s)]
*  like a family summer house, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4959.28s)]
*  there's too many stakeholders, as you say, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4960.64s)]
*  too many family members who want the money, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4963.44s)]
*  and it's hard to keep them going for that reason. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4966.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I mean, it is. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4968.839999999999s)]
*  Now, I mean, even in the Bush family, it's their credit. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4970.08s)]
*  I mean, they got through four generations. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4972.08s)]
*  No, I'm not criticizing them at all. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4973.839999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying at a certain point, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4975.04s)]
*  the family gets really big. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4976.08s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't own it anymore. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4977.2s)]
*  And there are certain members who want to run it [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4978.2s)]
*  and own it because it's their family legacy, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4979.839999999999s)]
*  it's their history. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4981.28s)]
*  And there are certain members just like, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4982.4s)]
*  I live in Aspen, send me the money. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4983.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're right. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4985.24s)]
*  So you got to find that right person. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4986.08s)]
*  At some point, just nepotism just doesn't work [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4987.32s)]
*  and there's going to be somebody outside better. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4989.16s)]
*  But I think that you can have actually US ownership, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4990.839999999999s)]
*  again, of the business. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4993.0s)]
*  And whereas, excuse me, Anaheim-Bush InBev, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4994.32s)]
*  it's a global company. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4996.44s)]
*  They have operations in China and Africa [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4997.64s)]
*  and South America and everywhere. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=4999.36s)]
*  The US at this point is only about, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5000.44s)]
*  I think 20% of their revenue [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5002.44s)]
*  and maybe a quarter of their profits. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5003.8s)]
*  So it actually to me, it makes tons of sense. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5005.68s)]
*  And the company this year will do, I don't know, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5008.48s)]
*  four and a half billion of called profits. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5010.32s)]
*  So I think there's somebody like Warren Buffett could come [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5013.08s)]
*  and maybe he buys the thing for 30 to $40 billion [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5015.8s)]
*  when he's sitting on $300 billion of cash. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5018.16s)]
*  And maybe all of a sudden you put actually, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5020.28s)]
*  you give actual real authority to US leadership. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5022.12s)]
*  So- [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5024.72s)]
*  And move it back to St. Louis. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5025.5599999999995s)]
*  Move back to St. Louis, move back to where it was. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5026.4s)]
*  Great town. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5028.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, put its whole corporate headquarters [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5029.0s)]
*  back there, put it back in the Midwest somewhere. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5030.4s)]
*  I think that would make a lot of sense. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5032.5199999999995s)]
*  Because otherwise you're going to continue [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5035.92s)]
*  to have a lot of competitors coming in [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5037.04s)]
*  and taking jobs and who knows. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5038.16s)]
*  Or give opportunities to folks like yourself. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5040.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, you're already going after the Zin folks with Alp. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5042.04s)]
*  So- [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5043.92s)]
*  Yeah, the Stonewall brand. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5044.96s)]
*  This is the non-Stonewall brand. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5047.16s)]
*  It's just Alp, American lip pillied, put it in your mouth. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5048.44s)]
*  You don't have to worry about where it's been. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5051.28s)]
*  It's good. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5052.719999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5054.12s)]
*  That was absolutely fascinating. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5054.96s)]
*  Yeah, thank you very much. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5056.24s)]
*  And then if you don't mind, just plug it at the end. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5057.599999999999s)]
*  But talk about all this in Last Call for Bud Light, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5059.5599999999995s)]
*  which is the book that we just released on this, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5061.36s)]
*  this past month. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5063.599999999999s)]
*  So I love people to go check it out. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5064.44s)]
*  I know your editor, Paul Schwa, one of my favorite people. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5066.32s)]
*  Oh, he's great. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5068.88s)]
*  I love Paul. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5069.719999999999s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5070.5599999999995s)]
*  You probably know Keith at Javelin as well. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5071.38s)]
*  I certainly do. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5072.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5073.0599999999995s)]
*  Great to see you. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5073.88s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Tucker. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5074.719999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5075.5599999999995s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is surprising. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5076.4s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5079.4s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5082.639999999999s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5084.2s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5085.0199999999995s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5086.679999999999s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5088.639999999999s)]
*  with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5092.2s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5095.2s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5098.2s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5099.599999999999s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5101.58s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5102.96s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5104.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5105.92s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5107.08s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5108.12s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5109.44s)]
*  that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5111.599999999999s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5114.44s)]
*  we think it's to subscribe to our channel. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5116.08s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5118.0s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5118.84s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5120.96s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5123.36s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5125.54s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evlQzZbk1BI&t=5128.48s)]
