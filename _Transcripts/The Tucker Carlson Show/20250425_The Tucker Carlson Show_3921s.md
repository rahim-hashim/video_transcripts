# Patrick Lancaster From the Frontlines of Ukraine/Russia War: Kamikaze Drones & Attacks on Christians
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U)
*  Over the past three years, hundreds, maybe thousands of Western journalists have covered the war in Ukraine from Ukraine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=0.0s)]
*  and effectively been attached to the Ukrainian government and its military and its many propaganda outlets, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=7.44s)]
*  taking their talking points from Ukrainian government officials, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=14.4s)]
*  interviewing President Zelensky, always in the most fawning possible way, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  and effectively carrying water for both the Ukrainian government and NATO and above all for the Biden administration. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=23.84s)]
*  On the other side in this war that the United States has effectively paid for, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=30.88s)]
*  there is one Western journalist, one American embedded with Russian troops. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=35.76s)]
*  His name is Patrick Lancaster. He's from St. Louis, Missouri. He's a U.S. Navy veteran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=42.16s)]
*  And for the past 11 years, he's been reporting from the region. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  For the past three years, he's been reporting from the front lines. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=50.8s)]
*  He's been interviewed by precisely no other mainstream Western media organizations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  And so it raises the question, how can you understand a war you're expected to take sides in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=61.92s)]
*  and then pay for if you're not hearing the other side? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=68.16s)]
*  So with that in mind, here's Patrick Lancaster. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Patrick Lancaster, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=75.84s)]
*  So you're one of the only, maybe the only American reporter embedded with Russian troops in this war. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=79.36s)]
*  How long have you been there? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=87.68s)]
*  Hi, Tucker. It's really an honor to be on here with you to show a little bit to the world about [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=91.28s)]
*  what the mainstream media doesn't want a lot of the people around the world to see. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  So it's really great and I appreciate the invitation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=104.16s)]
*  I have been covering this conflict, this war, for a lot longer than many people understand [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=108.48s)]
*  that it's going on. As you know, this didn't start three years ago. It started in 2014. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=117.44s)]
*  Some say even before, but for all intents and purposes, we could say 2014 when the war started [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=123.76s)]
*  following the events in Crimea where Crimea rejoined Russia because there was a referendum. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=131.60000000000002s)]
*  That's where I first started reporting on the situation between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=142.08s)]
*  I went to Crimea for the referendum where the Crimean people voted to break away from Ukraine [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=148.56s)]
*  and join Russia, rejoin Russia. Before 1956, Crimea was part of Russia. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=157.04s)]
*  If you think about this, the people that were born before that year were born in Russia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  There's people living that were born in Russia that were literally so happy to be joining Russia [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=170.55999999999997s)]
*  again, going home as the people on the streets told me when I was there. I've been there almost [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=178.0s)]
*  every year reporting since then as well. That's what really triggered my interest and intensity [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=182.8s)]
*  in reporting on the situation between Ukraine and Russia. When I went from Europe to Crimea and saw [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  the huge difference in what was being reported in the Western mainstream media about the real [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=198.24s)]
*  situation in Crimea, we were hearing in the West how Russia forces were going to be making people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  vote to break away from Ukraine and join Russia. I saw just the total opposite, people just crying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=210.56s)]
*  out of happiness to have the chance to rejoin Russia. Those are the real facts. Anyone that has [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=217.44s)]
*  been to Crimea knows that. Anyone that says something besides that is just not telling the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=223.12s)]
*  truth and trying to hide the truth. Unfortunately, after the events in Crimea where they joined [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=230.56s)]
*  the northern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, ended up becoming part of what you could say a civil war [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=241.36s)]
*  where they as well had a referendum to break away from Ukraine. That preceded the eight-year civil war [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=249.12s)]
*  where after the vote, the republics that they called themselves, Donetsk and Lugansk People's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=257.76000000000005s)]
*  Republics started to make their own governments, make their own militaries, and they were attacked [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  after this referendum by Ukraine. I spent eight years covering the situation in the Donetsk and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=277.84s)]
*  Lugansk areas, just documenting my part of the puzzle or the pie that wasn't being shown in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=288.8s)]
*  Western mainstream media because what I was showing then and now, what Western mainstream media doesn't, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=296.48s)]
*  it's not convenient for them to show. It doesn't fit their narrative. I documented what they weren't, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=303.04s)]
*  the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas by Ukraine, the targeting of civilian areas by [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=309.68s)]
*  Ukraine. My wife is from Donetsk and her childhood home was destroyed by Ukrainian shelling as well [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=319.6s)]
*  as the majority of her childhood neighborhood. These are the facts, the things that happened [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=326.4s)]
*  in the Donetsk and Lugansk territories long before 2022 when Russia came into this war. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  From 2014 to 2022 is when this civil war took place. Of course, Ukraine and the West claimed [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  Russia had invaded all the way back in 2014. That was the narrative then, but eventually that kind [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=350.56s)]
*  of slowly went away when they realized that this eight-year war wasn't really, there was no regular [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=359.36s)]
*  Russian troops taking part in that. This was a civil war that was lightly supported by the West, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=365.2s)]
*  Ukraine supported by the West. Wait, may I ask you a question to clarify something? You said that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=375.2s)]
*  your wife's childhood home was destroyed by shelling from the Ukrainian government. Why [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  were they shelling your wife's house? Was her family part of the fighting? Why would they do that? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=387.36s)]
*  Well, they pretty much leveled most of her childhood home or childhood neighborhood where [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=395.92s)]
*  her mother's home was. This neighborhood is just one of the many around Donetsk and the suburbs [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=403.76s)]
*  of Donetsk and specifically around the Donetsk airport. The Donetsk airport was like a symbol [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=412.24s)]
*  like a symbol of the war back in 2014-2015 where there was literally so much fighting. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=418.96s)]
*  There were two terminals. One terminal had the Ukrainian forces in it. One had the anti-Ukrain [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  government forces or rebels or pro-Russian forces, whatever you would have called them, the locals [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  that took off arms to fight to try to break away from Ukraine. They were fighting and basically [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=440.96s)]
*  Ukraine leveled, not completely leveled, but damaged if not destroyed the majority of the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=447.92s)]
*  homes all around this area, around the airport, just with indiscriminate shelling of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=454.56s)]
*  areas, the neighborhoods. Just destroying or seriously damaging almost every home and it just [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=465.04s)]
*  so happened my wife's childhood home was one of those. Thank God her family and her maids out, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=472.16s)]
*  okay, they were living there when the war started. They made it out okay, but the house was destroyed. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=480.24s)]
*  This is just one example of many homes and families that lost everything in the war. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=488.88s)]
*  I don't remember hearing in the United States at the time that there was a war [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  in Ukraine. I mean my sense is this was basically ignored completely and that Ukraine at that time [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=502.88s)]
*  was effectively under the control of the Obama administration. That was my sense. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people didn't really understand what was really happening on the ground, but [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=520.32s)]
*  basically, I mean it goes back to the Maidan revolution or whatever you want to call it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=530.0s)]
*  It's all in the eye of the beholder. The locals in the eastern part of Ukraine at that point looked [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  at the Maidan revolution as an illegal coup supported by the west where it ended up with [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=542.24s)]
*  their democratically elected president, Iadikovych, removed from office without them having anything [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=550.16s)]
*  to say about it and which effectively made their Ukraine dead and not in existence anymore after a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=557.28s)]
*  puppet government was put in by the United States in the west. So the people of the Donetsk and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=564.64s)]
*  Lugansk areas just they said, okay, well that's not our Ukraine. Ukraine's gone. Some of them were [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=571.84s)]
*  patriots for Ukraine before. They just said, okay, we don't have anything to do with that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=579.44s)]
*  We're going to have a vote. We're going to vote ourselves what to do with the right of self-determination [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  and Ukraine in the west did not want to respect the right of determination and Ukraine basically, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=590.24s)]
*  in the words of the locals, punished them for them trying to break away from Ukraine and every [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=596.88s)]
*  local family knew someone or had a member of their family injured or killed in the attacks by Ukrainian [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=605.68s)]
*  forces on the civilian areas of these regions, specifically the cities of Donetsk and Lugansk. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=612.96s)]
*  Okay, amazing. Data hawks are collecting your information anytime you visit a website, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=622.0s)]
*  every time you go online, every time you create an account, you make an online purchase, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=628.24s)]
*  your data is out there and you have no control over who sees it or what they do with it. So it's only [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=632.4s)]
*  a matter of time until somebody tries to exploit these facts. You have no privacy at all. Use your [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=637.84s)]
*  information to steal your identity and maybe bankrupt you. It happens all the time. It's [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=644.48s)]
*  happened to friends of ours, kids, and that's why we use Identity Guard. Identity Guard helps by [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=648.08s)]

*  If someone's trying to steal your identity, you know right away, often before real damage can be [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  done, before you're on the hook for the money. So if in fact your identity is stolen, the expert team [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=663.5200000000001s)]

*  million in identity theft insurance, which is a huge relief. Imagine waking up and finding out [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=679.28s)]
*  that someone in a foreign country is using your name and social security number to steal money [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=684.5600000000001s)]

*  the it all started with Russia. Russia officially came in. Russia officially recognized the Lugansk [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=735.52s)]
*  and Donetsk republics as separate from Ukraine. And the people had celebrations on the streets [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=746.88s)]
*  out of just celebrating the fact that Russia recognized them. And they knew that that meant [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=757.52s)]
*  that Russia was going to be helping these republics. And then days later, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=763.76s)]
*  Russia came across the border and the war between Ukraine and Russia started. You know, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=771.28s)]
*  one way or another, the war between Russia and the West started. Western weapons at least. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=781.84s)]
*  And as many people around the world thought it was going to go a lot quicker than it has, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=789.52s)]
*  I myself did a report in the center of Donetsk where I assumed and thought that Russia was going [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  to be pushing Ukraine back within days from the city of Donetsk. Because you have to imagine the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=805.92s)]
*  front line of Donetsk was just on the outskirts of the city. We're talking from the center of the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=814.24s)]
*  city to the edge, just about to the front line, just about five miles with often just straight [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=821.12s)]
*  shelling hitting the center of the city. And as we know, it didn't end in three days like [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=831.12s)]
*  General Meili said it would. And there's been a lot of intense battles around these areas. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=837.84s)]
*  And in fact, right now, I believe there is eight regions between what is internationally recognized [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=848.96s)]
*  as Ukraine or Russia recognizes as Russia. But overall, there's eight regions that have active [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=858.64s)]
*  fighting. Some are Russian, some are pre-war Russian, after war Russian, whatever you want to call it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=867.2s)]
*  We've got the Zaporozhye region, Hursun region, Donetsk region, and Lugansk region, which all four [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=873.6s)]
*  of those had referendums in 2022 September where they, the Russian backed referendums [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=881.52s)]
*  unrecognized by the West, where they voted to join Russia. And then shortly after Russia took them in [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=888.72s)]
*  officially. And then in addition to those four regions, you've got two regions of [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=897.5200000000001s)]
*  Russia, the Belgorod region of Russia and the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukraine came across [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=906.96s)]
*  the border and invaded, incurred on pre-2022 Russia. And in actually in the area of Kursk, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  they controlled last August about 1500 square kilometers. Since then it's been really [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=930.48s)]
*  reduced by Russian forces. But in addition to those six territories, we've also got [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=941.44s)]
*  the Sumy region of Ukraine, which there's some villages and some territory that Russia controls [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=948.4s)]
*  and there's active, very intense fighting going on there. And now that's borders, the Kursk region. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=955.6800000000001s)]
*  So basically Russia went past the territory that was controlled by Ukraine, the Kursk region of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=962.32s)]
*  Russia and took territory in the Sumy region. Now also in the Harkov region of Ukraine, Russia [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=967.92s)]
*  controls some territory as well. And again, intense fighting going on there. So we've got [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=977.5999999999999s)]
*  eight regions with intense fighting and the war keeps changing. So much has changed, of course, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=985.92s)]
*  in the last 11 years, as far as how the fighting has changed and how it's going on now. And even [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=996.32s)]
*  since 2022 when Russia first came in and now the situation is the air war, the drone war. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1005.6s)]
*  I mean, it's like the war of the future now compared to what it used to be 11 years ago. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1014.0s)]
*  I mean, the most dangerous part of my job is actually getting to the front line to film [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1020.96s)]
*  what's happening on the front line, because in the vehicles getting there is just there's always [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1028.48s)]
*  drones around. And these are kamikaze drones that are the main threat. Of course, there's [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1035.3600000000001s)]
*  reconnaissance drones as well. But these kamikazes, they will just hitch, they're hunting vehicles [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1040.48s)]
*  around and going back and forth on the front line. And they will just hit the vehicle and explode. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1049.52s)]
*  And now they've even gone a step forward where jamming or electronic warfare doesn't affect them [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1056.16s)]
*  because they use fiber optic cables to control these drones where this little bitty cable [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1063.3600000000001s)]
*  goes from behind the drone to the remote control. They're cabled drones and they can go up to 30 [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1070.88s)]
*  kilometers. And actually, this right here is some of the fiber optic cable that is used to control [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1077.68s)]
*  these drones. And those are the most deadly on the front line because you can't do anything about it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1087.2s)]
*  You can't even detect them with a drone detector. So what is that? What is that like? Have you seen [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1094.8s)]
*  the kamikaze drones hit and explode? Well, just I guess just over three weeks ago, I was in the [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1102.16s)]
*  Kursk region of Russia trying to actually get back from the front line. And I was with a team from [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1111.92s)]
*  the Russian forces, Akhmat Brigade, and they were evacuating civilians from the front line. We [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1122.48s)]
*  actually got to the point of, as they called it, the point of zero, which the edge of the village [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1131.84s)]
*  where we were, what are the Ukrainian forces. And as we got there, there were several overhead [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1136.9599999999998s)]
*  and they engaged one on the ground and it came down. Wasn't that intense, you could say. So they [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1143.9199999999998s)]
*  loaded the civilians in this truck. So in the cab of the truck were these four elderly civilians. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1151.84s)]
*  And the soldier that was driving and then myself and another journalist, a colleague of mine, were [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1158.24s)]
*  in the back of the truck with two soldiers and we were trying to evacuate this village. And as we [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1164.4s)]
*  got out of the, just outside the village, I happened to be filming one of the soldiers as they [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1175.52s)]
*  were scanning the skies and the other soldier actually pointed up and said a drone and a few [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1182.56s)]
*  other curse words. And I looked up and there was a drone, a kamikaze drone. Right away, I knew what [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1190.56s)]
*  it was and I knew the danger we were in. And the soldiers started firing on it, engaging it, trying [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1197.6s)]
*  to knock it down as it was trying to attack us and kill us. And they signaled to the driver and [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1206.48s)]
*  the driver just floored it. It was just driving as fast as possible. And I'm filming them shooting [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1212.72s)]
*  at the drone, the drone's trying to hit us. I thought that we were going to be, you know, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1219.44s)]
*  worst, a best case scenario, injured. Because, I mean, it got so close to us as we were just driving, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1225.52s)]
*  just got right up on us. And then after about five minutes of it chasing us, well, what felt [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1232.32s)]
*  like five minutes might have been a few minutes less, it was knocked down. And how do you knock [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  down a drone? How do you knock down a suicide drone over you? They were engaging it with a [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1247.76s)]
*  shotgun and machine guns. And that's, it was coming at us. And it was in the video, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1255.84s)]
*  it's a little bit unclear if their bullets actually hit it or hit a wire that was going [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1265.36s)]
*  over the road. But for about five minutes, three minutes, something like that, they were firing at [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1269.9199999999998s)]
*  it with a shotgun and a machine gun. Now the shotgun is the most, the new weapon of choice [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1274.56s)]
*  on the front line, because it's got the buck shot and it spreads. And these, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1280.88s)]
*  the idea is there's more room to hit, just like you're shooting at a bird. That's actually what [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1287.92s)]
*  they call these drones, birds. So they're, they go hunting with this shotgun for these drones. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1294.48s)]
*  And luckily, thank God, God was with us that day and it did not hit its target. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1301.7600000000002s)]
*  So we made it to report another day. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1309.3600000000001s)]
*  Mother's Day is almost here and you're under a lot of pressure to find something great for the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1313.8400000000001s)]
*  mothers in your life. So instead of getting something you hope will check the box in a way [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1318.8s)]
*  to see if the mom you're giving it to actually likes it, give her something she will genuinely [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1322.96s)]
*  love, Cozy Earth. Cozy Earth makes the softest, most breathable bedding and pajamas the women [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1328.72s)]
*  have ever experienced. Crafted from temperature regulating bamboo fabric. Bamboo fabric? It sounds [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1334.96s)]
*  weird, but it's awesome. Try it. When you give it, people will be a little bit confused and then [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1340.64s)]
*  they will fall in love. This is something she will use every single day. Unlike other presents, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1346.88s)]
*  you don't have to worry about this being thrown into the closet, an embarrassing silence when [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  you hand it over. Everybody loves Cozy Earth. It's got a hundred night sleep trial, a 10 year [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  warranty, so it's risk free. Get it today. So skip the flowers, give comfort that lasts. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1361.6s)]
*  Go to CozyEarth.com slash Tucker. Use the code Tucker to get up to 40% off sheets, pajamas, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1366.7199999999998s)]
*  towels, everything they make. And if you get a post purchase survey, make sure to say that you [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1373.6799999999998s)]
*  heard about Cozy Earth from us on this show. So one of the most confusing questions in the West [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1378.32s)]
*  is the most obvious question, which is who's winning? And even now we're told that Ukraine [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1387.92s)]
*  has a shot to win. Lindsey Graham has been saying this even recently. If only US taxpayers would [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1393.92s)]
*  send Zelensky's government more money. What's your perspective as someone who's covering the war [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1400.08s)]
*  from the front lines? Well, I think the idea of Ukraine's [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1406.8s)]
*  winning the war is just this dream and narrative that's been put out by the West to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1414.0s)]
*  make it acceptable for so much money to be put into Ukraine to extend this war, to bring [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1426.72s)]
*  the Russian forces down in the country of Russia, just to make them use their resources more, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1436.16s)]
*  including losing more people. I mean, if the United States and the West would not have [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1443.6s)]
*  been supplying the weapons and the funding to Ukraine for the last three years, the war would [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1449.92s)]
*  have ended three years ago, if not two and a half years ago. And if the US had been able to do that, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1456.64s)]
*  if not two and a half years ago, hundreds of thousands of lives would have been saved. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1464.16s)]
*  The funding and the support of the West for Ukraine is directly responsible for hundreds of [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1474.0800000000002s)]
*  thousands of these deaths of soldiers on both sides and civilians for that matter. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1481.8400000000001s)]
*  It's just a horrible scene. How many have died? The other question that we can never get a straight [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1491.76s)]
*  answer to or any answer to is how many have died on both sides? Do you have any guess? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1497.76s)]
*  It's hard for me to say. My kind of thing in my reports is reporting of what I see, keeping my [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1507.6s)]
*  opinions out of it. So what I can tell you is of what I've seen. What are the hottest areas that [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1515.04s)]
*  I was been before Kursk and Belgrade where I am now was the Mariupol frontline where I followed [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1520.88s)]
*  the Russian frontline day by day in the heats of the Battle of Mariupol. And just that month, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1532.0s)]
*  I personally saw between a thousand and two thousand bodies and it was soldiers, civilians. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1539.9199999999998s)]
*  The whole city was just covered in bodies. In a matter of a 30-minute period, one time I counted [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1552.48s)]
*  87 bodies just lighting the streets. It's really a horrible situation. Just seeing so many war [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1562.0s)]
*  crimes involved, so many testimonies from locals about Ukrainian forces. Basically, literally, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1573.12s)]
*  these are not my words. These are the words of the locals that everything I say can be seen on my [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1583.2s)]
*  YouTube channel. These locals say that Ukrainian forces literally use them as human shields, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1588.72s)]
*  would set up their tanks in between the apartment buildings and fire at Russian forces. And in other [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1594.96s)]
*  cases, they would directly fire on the civilian buildings. Ukraine forces directly firing on [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1605.04s)]
*  civilian buildings. This is what the locals told me on camera and it can be seen. Not just one off, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1612.0s)]
*  a constant daily event. Unfortunately, there were many instances of Ukrainian forces using schools [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1618.4s)]
*  as bases. One of my first days in Mariupol found a school, school number 25 of Mariupol. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1630.16s)]
*  I'll never forget it. Went into the basement and found that Ukrainian forces were using this [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1639.68s)]
*  basement as a military position. Many burned out rooms and weapons, uniforms, flags, Ukrainian flags. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1646.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, we found a dead civilian woman who was naked and she had a bag over her head. It was [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1658.8s)]
*  clearly raped and tortured. It was clearly a civilian from the area that Ukrainian forces had [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1673.68s)]
*  kidnapped and tortured and raped. It's actually a little unclear whether it was burned or carved a [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  swastika on her stomach. Really, this is the first time that it's stood out to me, the psychological [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1690.0800000000002s)]
*  effect of some of these instances. In my mind, I still remember seeing a bandage over her head, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1699.84s)]
*  kind of like something like she was injured and it was bandaged. But if you look at the video, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1707.84s)]
*  you see it was a plastic bag that was used to execute her. Now, that's just one of the many [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1712.32s)]
*  examples of executions that I've seen by Ukrainian forces. The most recent were in the Kursk region. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1718.8s)]
*  Just this last January, I was with Russian regular army forces and they had just days before [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1727.28s)]
*  gotten to this village and basically kicked Ukrainian forces out and the village was destroyed. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1740.72s)]
*  And there was a shelter, a basement basically, that we went down into and found a group of [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1748.64s)]
*  civilians. There was two elderly women and one elderly man that had been killed clearly by [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1758.4s)]
*  Ukrainian forces because as we walked down the steps, the smell was so bad we had to put gas [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1768.72s)]
*  masks on. And at the bottom of the steps, we couldn't really say how many people because it [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1775.12s)]
*  was clear that some sort of explosive, I assume a grenade, was thrown down in the shelter where [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1783.4399999999998s)]
*  these people were hiding. And the people near the door, actually with a dog that were there, were just [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1789.6s)]
*  turned into soup basically. So it wasn't really clear how many were there. But then as we went [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1797.12s)]
*  farther back into the shelter, we found, as I said, two elderly women that were killed by the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1806.7199999999998s)]
*  explosion and an elderly man. And then back in August, as I said, when Ukraine first came in [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1813.36s)]
*  to Kursk, I was also there and met a man who explained how he was trying to evacuate his family [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1821.6s)]
*  from the Suzha region, which was basically the stronghold of Ukrainian forces when they came into [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1831.76s)]
*  the Kursk region of Russia. And he explained how he was evacuating his pregnant wife, their one-year-old [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1839.36s)]
*  son, and his wife's mother. And they had two vehicles and this is basically they were surprised [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1849.6s)]
*  that war broke out in their village because they weren't part of the war zone before August. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1856.0s)]
*  And so he decided he was going to drive in the front car and have his family in the back with [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1861.04s)]
*  his wife driving behind just in case something's happened, it would hit him first and they might [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1866.7199999999998s)]
*  make it away. And they were, he said they were driving, came around a turn and came face to [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1872.1599999999999s)]
*  face with a Ukraine or pro-Ukraine soldier. He said just two meters away from him. He said there [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1878.72s)]
*  was no way that the soldier did not see that they were civilians. There was no question they were [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1886.08s)]
*  civilians. And the soldier opened fire. The bullet went through the bill of his cap and a few into [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1892.48s)]
*  his vehicle and they kept on driving as they were being fired at and got some distance between and [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1900.08s)]
*  went around another corner. And these are his words, not mine. And he saw that his wife's vehicle was [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1910.8s)]
*  slowing down and he waited for it to speed up. And then when her car hit the back of his car, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1918.3999999999999s)]
*  he knew something was wrong. And he went back to check on his family and the other car and his wife, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1927.76s)]
*  pregnant wife was huddled over their one-year-old son with bullet holes in the side of her stomach. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1934.96s)]
*  And he picked her up, took her to the nearest hospital they could find and they weren't able [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1941.68s)]
*  to save her. He tried to do CPR and his words massage her heart back to life. And their [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1950.4s)]
*  one-year-old son was injured but thank God he lived. And then unfortunately he wasn't able to [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1957.52s)]
*  cover her body for many months afterwards. But now things have changed quite considerably in the Kursk [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1963.8400000000001s)]
*  region. As I said, it started in August with Ukraine just surprising many coming across, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1972.5600000000002s)]
*  taking 1500 square kilometers. And then right when they did that, Russia started taking some back. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1978.6399999999999s)]
*  And I was with them. I went with the assault groups to the Ukrainian lines as the assault [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1987.52s)]
*  groups took territory back. And Russia started going and going and going and taking these [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=1993.28s)]
*  villages back and almost slowed down as far as the recovery of the territory by Russian forces [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2004.48s)]
*  until last month when an operation of Russian forces literally went into these gas pipes [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2012.48s)]
*  and they tunneled underneath Ukrainian lines and reported 600 Russian forces soldiers came up behind [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2020.48s)]
*  Ukrainian lines. And that operation with an assault from the other side basically collapsed [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2030.88s)]
*  Ukrainian lines. And now there's just a very small amount of Ukrainian forces left in the Kursk region. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2040.5600000000002s)]
*  And just yesterday there were a report from the Russian Ministry of Defense that some territory [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2049.36s)]
*  had been taken back by Russian forces. Now unfortunately this is leaving [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2056.0s)]
*  tens of thousands of people homeless, that homes were destroyed in this [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2064.7200000000003s)]
*  incursion or invasion by Russian forces or Ukrainian forces into this region of Russia. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2072.2400000000002s)]
*  And basically the standard thing for the Russian government to do is give certificates for new [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2079.44s)]
*  homes to the victims. They've actually gotten pretty good at it because there's so many regions [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2088.56s)]
*  of people that have had their homes lost by Ukrainian shelling. But one thing that I noticed [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2093.52s)]
*  it's pretty interesting about what they're doing in the Kursk region on top of the certificate [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2100.48s)]
*  is because they compared to what the United States does when someone loses their house say to a [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2107.6s)]
*  national disaster. The governor of Kursk Alexander Kinsh thing started an initiative to request from [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2113.68s)]
*  Moscow a special stipend or payment of a monthly payment of 65,000 rubles for every member of a [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2124.24s)]
*  family whose home was lost monthly. So that's about $750. So if it's a family of four that's [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2133.92s)]
*  about $3,000 a month. Of course that's not going to replace everything in their lives that they've [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2145.12s)]
*  lost but it's a lot more than I think what was the United States giving to some of the natural [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2152.88s)]
*  disaster I think 700 lump sum payments something like that. So it's interesting to see the [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2158.72s)]
*  comparison. So think about how you'll feel when you achieve your biggest goals of all whether it's [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2164.96s)]
*  starting a business paying off your mortgage send your kids to college and have the money to pay [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2171.68s)]
*  for it. You'll be pretty proud when you've met these essential life goals and you should be proud [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2175.3599999999997s)]
*  all of us are when we do that. But what do you do next? So getting to the goals is one thing but [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2179.8399999999997s)]
*  protecting them is an entirely different thing and maybe a bigger thing. And this is where life [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2185.2s)]
*  insurance from Policy Genius comes in. Now Policy Genius makes finding and buying life insurance [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2190.16s)]
*  really easy. You probably want life insurance but it's expensive and how do you even get it? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2194.96s)]
*  Policy Genius makes it simple and it means that your family has the safety net it needs to cover [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2200.24s)]
*  expenses and to face the future. Nearly half of Americans look back and wish they'd gotten life [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2205.2s)]
*  insurance earlier. It can change everything if you have it because you don't know what the future [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2210.48s)]
*  holds honestly. So with Policy Genius you can find policy starting at just 292 bucks per year [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2213.76s)]
*  for a million dollars of coverage and some options are 100 percent online and that means [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2219.5200000000004s)]
*  no unnecessary medical exams for you which is a win. You compare quotes from top insurers side [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2224.1600000000003s)]
*  by side you talk to licensed agents you secure your families tomorrow with peace of mind today [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2229.92s)]
*  and it makes it super easy on Policy Genius. And it's all transparent you know exactly what [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2234.88s)]
*  you're getting. So you head to policygenius.com.uk or click the link in the description to get your [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2239.6s)]
*  free quote that's policygenius.com.uk. So let me ask you let me ask you from our perspective over [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2244.64s)]
*  here the Ukrainian government is not just at war with Russia but also with Christianity. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2252.7999999999997s)]
*  The Ukrainian government has banned the largest Christian denomination [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2258.64s)]
*  in Ukraine and has embraced transgenderism and other explicitly anti-Christian [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2262.56s)]
*  forms of expression. Are you aware of that? Are the Russians aware of that? Is there a religious [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2269.9199999999996s)]
*  component just because their hostility to Christianity is so obvious? I wonder if you notice it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2276.48s)]
*  Well I always ask the soldiers on the front line who are documenting fighting you know what they're [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2282.3199999999997s)]
*  doing there. Why are they fighting? What are they fighting for? And often an answer that they give [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2291.68s)]
*  is they're fighting Satan because they view the religious atmosphere so different as you point out [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2301.2s)]
*  in Ukraine than the traditional Russian society. So it's quite a [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2313.8399999999997s)]
*  a religion is very important to the Russian soldier and of course I think it's quite a bit [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2321.84s)]
*  more than you know the traditional you say there's no atheists on the front line but [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2330.88s)]
*  this goes a lot deeper into their cultural heritage. Have you seen any North Korean soldiers? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2336.8s)]
*  No I have not. Not a lack of trying. I tried to investigate the reports of these North Korean [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2344.16s)]
*  soldiers and I was not able to locate any of them. Of course there's rumors all of the world of this [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2356.16s)]
*  but I was not able to locate any of them. How many American correspondents are embedded with [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2365.2799999999997s)]
*  Russian units that you know of? One. Me. So no one from NBC or CNN or Fox or [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2371.28s)]
*  PBS or New York Times, Washington Post, you're not aware of any American correspondents covering [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2384.0800000000004s)]
*  the other side in this war? No. So does it feel to you that American [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2391.84s)]
*  reporters have basically taken the side of the Biden administration which told us that Russia [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2402.8s)]
*  is our enemy and are uncritically repeating US government talking points? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2410.08s)]
*  Yeah I mean of course the Western media has their narrative and you know unfortunately they try to [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2414.48s)]
*  hide the facts that most of what I report they tried to hide and not report on it and you know [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2426.64s)]
*  I tell all my viewers don't just watch my reports because I don't have all my reports on the internet [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2434.96s)]
*  because I don't have all the experience but I'm showing you what the mainstream media doesn't [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2443.2s)]
*  want you to see. I'm just giving you my piece of the puzzle something that you're not going to see [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2448.72s)]
*  anywhere else unfortunately but you know people need to get as many perspectives as possible [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2454.88s)]
*  and educate themselves not just be led like sheep by the mainstream media. I'm very glad [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2463.04s)]
*  there's people like you out there as well that you know could give someone a little bit something [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2470.16s)]
*  to think about other than just the narrative that is trying to be forced down the throat. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2477.52s)]
*  Yeah I mean if you're the only American correspondent embedded with Russian units [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2483.04s)]
*  then I would think you would be in high demand. I'm embarrassed it's taken me over three years [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2489.84s)]
*  to talk to you that's my fault but I mean I assume you're getting calls every week from [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2494.4s)]
*  American news organizations trying to understand what's happening. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2499.12s)]
*  Unfortunately no they don't seem too interested in discussing things with me or seeing the [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2504.3199999999997s)]
*  information that I'm putting out and in fact in 2014, 15, and 16 I was what I would say is a [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2513.68s)]
*  a freelance journalist videographer as well until you know I felt like my work was being betrayed [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2527.84s)]
*  and because I was giving this material and then once I saw that the material was being lied about [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2540.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean one instance I was in the Lugansk region in Perivomaisk when Ukraine forces launched a [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2550.96s)]

*  in the last three years no I have not [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2897.68s)]
*  how is YouTube treating you [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2904.24s)]
*  well I haven't been monetized on YouTube basically at all I started my YouTube channel in [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2909.2s)]
*  2014 and there's no monetization whatsoever why on what grounds were you demonetized [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2915.44s)]
*  uh you know it's been literally over a decade ago but I believe just the fact of war and [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2928.24s)]
*  you know they're just not interested in putting commercials on my material I guess because it [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2938.64s)]
*  doesn't fit the Western Main Street narrative but you know it's great that I'm still able to use [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2944.24s)]
*  the platform to show the world some of the things that's happening but unfortunately it's not [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2954.4s)]
*  monetized so I'm only supported by as I said my my viewers through donations but you know what I [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2958.88s)]
*  do it's not really because of the money yeah of course I've got to support my family but you know [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2967.12s)]
*  after as I said after I saw the how different what was being shown in the West what was happening [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2973.84s)]
*  and I just had to do something about it and you know if you would ask me before 12 years ago would [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2980.4s)]
*  I be a war correspondent you know going to the front lines with you know showing the reality of [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2987.52s)]
*  what's happening and I'd be the only one doing it it just would be uh amazing to me I mean [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=2994.4s)]
*  given the atrocities you've seen some incredibly ugly things you described a few of them [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3003.04s)]
*  but it's been so long I wonder what effect that has on you as a person to see things like that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3010.08s)]
*  well I mean [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3018.2400000000002s)]
*  I would say before this war I wasn't I had mixed thoughts about what post-traumatic stress really [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3022.56s)]
*  was and how serious it was but I can tell you now there's no doubt that's it's definitely a thing [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3030.88s)]
*  you know I I would say quite different this is of course everything I've seen here is quite [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3040.8s)]
*  different than when I was in the US military I used to be in the uh in the US Navy from 2001 [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3047.92s)]
*  till 2006 and I was on a the USS Kitty Hawk that was involved with Operation Iraqi Freedom and [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3056.2400000000002s)]
*  uh you know never saw anything like that there like I see here of course but um you know you know [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3065.44s)]
*  you know I always find it's uh uh interesting how the US calls calls all of their operations [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3074.1600000000003s)]
*  operations but when Russia says that it's not a war it's a special military operation the [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3083.84s)]
*  western media makes this big thing about it how oh it's legal to call it a war in Russia and all [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3090.7999999999997s)]
*  that which is total bull and the war is a war Operation Iraqi Freedom was a war and Russia's [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3096.4799999999996s)]
*  special military operation was a war and the eight years before it was a civil war a war is a war [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3104.3199999999997s)]
*  regardless what you want to uh call it and I'm in Russia now calling it a war nothing's going to [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3109.9199999999996s)]
*  happen for because of it um so that's just another false narrative that the western media pushed of [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3115.76s)]
*  you know trying to say no freedom of speech in Russia and all that just total falsehood [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3125.0400000000004s)]
*  so um did you know Gonzalo Lira who was maybe the only other American who was looking critically [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3133.76s)]
*  at what the Ukrainian government is doing he was murdered by the Ukrainian government as you know [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3142.72s)]
*  did you ever run across him and are you worried that if you fell into Ukrainian hands they would [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3148.16s)]
*  murder you too um well we we talked over online a couple of times uh you know he was definitely [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3152.16s)]
*  ballsy yeah I mean to for him to go against the Ukrainian government while he was there [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3161.9199999999996s)]
*  and unfortunately didn't work so well for him um and of course if I was able ever [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3169.9199999999996s)]
*  if I ever ended up in Ukrainian forces it would not be in Ukrainian forces hands it would not be [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3183.2799999999997s)]
*  a very nice time uh you know I've been on the the Ukrainian kill list or [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3190.08s)]
*  whatever you want to enemies of the state list which I believe you are as well Marat [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3197.84s)]
*  Orits I believe uh we're both on there I've been on that list since uh 2016 the the list that's [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3202.4s)]
*  non-governmental uh list that they put names of people that are an enemy of Ukraine and they [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3214.08s)]
*  write because of my work that I'm an assistance to terrorism and they've posted [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3223.36s)]
*  photos of my children my wife they in the past they've even posted her um personal telephone [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3230.56s)]
*  number she had to change your number because of it so yeah it would not be a good thing if I ended [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3238.08s)]
*  up in the hands of Russian or Ukrainian forces the the Ukrainian um war effort has been led by [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3245.2s)]
*  the United States do you have any which is a fact most Americans I think even now don't understand [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3251.68s)]
*  do you have any idea how many Americans have been killed fighting for Ukraine [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3258.64s)]
*  um well we know it happens uh I would say there's probably a lot more that have been [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3266.24s)]
*  killed for Ukraine than is public knowledge yes um I mean there's you can imagine that there [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3273.28s)]
*  is probably some internal operations on the front line that involve uh western special forces [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3282.1600000000003s)]
*  and not all of them made it out um I've talked to uh soldiers on the front Russian soldiers on the [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3290.96s)]
*  front line about foreign mercenaries or foreign soldiers and they said they encountered them all [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3300.08s)]
*  the time from European countries from US uh and more and it also as I've actually made a video [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3307.84s)]
*  last month about it seems Russia's not really playing around anymore when it comes to [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3317.12s)]
*  uh foreign fighters or what they consider all the foreign fighters they consider foreign [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3323.2799999999997s)]
*  mercenaries and Vladimir Putin says that these foreign mercenaries do not get the projection [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3330.16s)]
*  of the Jiva convent convention and are the there's a possibility of execution [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3337.7599999999998s)]
*  so it really seems like now that there's only two outcomes for these [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3348.72s)]
*  foreigners that come over here to fight if they come into Russian hands it's jail or death [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3356.0s)]
*  and I say jail because in the beginning of March there was a British soldier who was taken prisoner [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3363.04s)]
*  by Russian forces who was uh he believed he was taking prisoner in November of last year in the [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3371.36s)]
*  Kursk region and he went through his trial and was convicted uh and received a 19-year sentence [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3379.2000000000003s)]
*  so it seems Russia's going pretty strong on the foreigners here how long do you think this war [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3391.6s)]
*  will go on it's a very difficult question um I've back in 2022 I tried to make as I said the [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3398.24s)]
*  predictions like uh many people around the world did and everyone was wrong I mean the I of course [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3411.7599999999998s)]
*  the most important thing is people stop dying and it would be great if today there was a ceasefire [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3419.2799999999997s)]
*  declared and everyone stopped dying and everything went back to peace and all that but I don't think [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3426.16s)]
*  it's going to be happening anytime soon unfortunately because Russia has made it clear [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3436.96s)]
*  that Russian law considers the four regions Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk Lugansk part of Russia [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3442.96s)]
*  western law and of course Crimea but even now Trump says he's gonna say Crimea is Russia so [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3452.72s)]
*  that's not even worth discussing anymore um but uh Ukraine law and western law says that these [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3459.8399999999997s)]
*  four regions are parts of Ukraine Russia cannot stop until they control what is legally by Russian [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3467.52s)]
*  law considered part of Russia regardless what side of this conflict you favor looking at Russian law [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3477.76s)]
*  Russian law cannot stop the war until they control part of all of what Russian law considers part of [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3486.6400000000003s)]
*  Russia and I've been saying this for years it was one thing before September of 2022 when Russia [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3495.2000000000003s)]
*  could have stopped and had a quick peace deal but after September of 2022 these four regions were [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3503.2s)]
*  legally as far as Russian law considers part of Russia and Russia cannot stop until it controls [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3514.16s)]
*  this and Slonitsky, Ukraine and the west has made it clear that Ukrainian forces are not just going [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3520.8799999999997s)]
*  to stand up and leave these regions now if we look at Lugansk there's 99 percent of the area of Lugansk [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3528.16s)]
*  that's controlled by Russia but if you go south to the Donetsk region it's uh there's less controlled [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3536.32s)]
*  by Russia's with several important uh key places like Kramatorsk and Slaviansk which actually [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3543.7599999999998s)]
*  the water supply to Donetsk and then of course in Hursun you got the city of Hursun and Zaporozhia [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3551.28s)]
*  the city of Zaporozhia which are cut geographically by a river is basically the front line now [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3560.4s)]
*  and I mentioned the water supply for Donetsk basically after Russia took control of [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3569.28s)]
*  Mariupol in 2022 the first thing Ukraine did was cut the water from the Kramatorsk area going into [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3576.48s)]
*  Donetsk and down to Mariupol the reason they didn't cut the water to Donetsk in the previous [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3587.12s)]
*  eight years like they did with Crimea because that was the first thing they did with Crimea when Russia [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3593.36s)]
*  took Crimea and they cut the water supply from Ukraine literally dammed the canal that was [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3599.28s)]
*  feeding water to the people of Ukraine of Crimea and the water supply was going underneath Donetsk [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3604.16s)]
*  into Mariupol and Mariupol had to be fed by water when it controlled Mariupol but once Russia fully [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3613.12s)]
*  took control Ukraine shut off the water to Donetsk and Mariupol and for a long time in Donetsk you [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3619.52s)]
*  were only getting two hours every three days of water I mean just horrible living conditions [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3628.56s)]
*  because Ukraine made the decision to shut off the water to these people the people that they said [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3635.36s)]
*  they wanted they were trying to stop from leaving the country for eight years and Russia made a huge [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3641.2799999999997s)]
*  project to bring water from the Rostov region into the Donetsk region and it's still ongoing and now [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3650.72s)]
*  there's a couple hours a day of water in Donetsk. That's horrifying have you seen any reports of [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3659.36s)]
*  the Ukrainian military selling NATO arms outside of Ukraine? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3669.12s)]
*  There has been some reports of western supplied weapons showing up in the cartel hands in Mexico [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3673.2s)]
*  and other places but what I can tell you I have seen with my own eyes is Russian forces using these [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3689.8399999999997s)]
*  weapons back against Ukraine weapons that Ukraine got from NATO countries and Russia captured them [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3698.8s)]
*  and turned them back against Ukraine and reverse is in the process of reverse engineering. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3708.0s)]
*  I just did a report where I went with a soldier group to a undisclosed location where they had [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3717.6800000000003s)]
*  about 20 military vehicles NATO military vehicles that were on their way to be getting [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3729.28s)]
*  reverse engineered and basically any type of secret information they could get out of them [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3734.88s)]
*  and that report will be coming out soon but I would say Russia's getting a lot out of these [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3740.7200000000003s)]
*  NATO weapons. Last question thank you Patrick for taking all this time. Do you think the [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3749.44s)]
*  US population Americans would have supported this war which they've paid for for over three [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3758.88s)]
*  years as long as they did if they'd had factual unbiased news coverage of what was actually happening there? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3765.44s)]
*  No definitely not and one reason is to go back to one of your previous [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3777.28s)]
*  questions about what's not being reported in the west that I could bring to light. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3784.8s)]
*  Well let's talk about the people of these areas specifically the Donetsk and Lugansk areas [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3791.28s)]
*  for the last 11 years just wanting to break away from Ukraine and the right of self-determination. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3798.48s)]
*  I've been and say this in the media that these people were not being held down by these rebels [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3804.7200000000003s)]
*  or whatever you want to call them these people were doing their best to leave Ukraine and Ukraine [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3811.28s)]
*  was punishing them for that. They voted to break away from Ukraine so it's I mean definitely if the [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3817.6800000000003s)]
*  western people would really understand what's really been happening here over the last 11 years [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3830.6400000000003s)]
*  not just the last three years but the overall situation there's no way they would have wanted [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3835.84s)]
*  their tax money to be supporting this and killing hundreds of thousands of people. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3843.6000000000004s)]
*  I believe that. Patrick Lancaster thank you for doing this interview I hope you're safe [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3849.44s)]
*  I appreciate it I hope you'll come back. Thank you very much Mr. Carlson I appreciate you having me [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3857.44s)]
*  and I definitely am looking forward to the next time and hopefully one day we meet in person. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3863.12s)]
*  Godspeed. Thanks. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3867.3599999999997s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level that's not surprising that's [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3870.3199999999997s)]
*  what they do but on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3875.44s)]
*  now all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars on the cusp of [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3879.44s)]
*  fighting right now Google has decided you should have less information rather than more and that [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3884.72s)]
*  is totally wrong it's immoral what can you do about it well we could whine about it that's a [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3890.88s)]
*  waste of time we're not in charge of Google or we could find a way around it a way that you could [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3897.12s)]
*  actually get information that is true not intentionally deceptive the way to do that on [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3901.44s)]
*  YouTube we think it's to subscribe to our channel subscribe hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3906.7200000000003s)]
*  when we upload and share this video that way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3912.0s)]
*  actual news and information so we hope that you'll do that [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NObi_e3yf3U&t=3917.6s)]
