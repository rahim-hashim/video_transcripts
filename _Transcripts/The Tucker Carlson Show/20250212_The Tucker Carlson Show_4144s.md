# Ken Paxton: How Soros Protects Drug Cartels, Being Blacklisted by Fox News, and the Laken Riley Act
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY)
*  Thank you for coming on, Mr. Attorney General. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=0.0s)]
*  Glad to be here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2.6s)]
*  So the most pressing problem, I think it's fair to say, as an outsider in Texas is immigration. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3.6s)]
*  It's totally changed your state in every way. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=8.26s)]
*  Do you expect that the new administration and the executive orders in the first couple [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=11.9s)]
*  of days are going to have a material effect, a noticeable effect? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=15.98s)]
*  I know they are. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=18.66s)]
*  Just because I saw what happened four years ago, or eight years ago when Trump came into [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=19.66s)]
*  office. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=23.86s)]
*  I've been in politics since Bush was in office and I've seen how Republicans and Democrats [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=25.86s)]
*  have dealt with immigration. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=31.02s)]
*  They have not dealt with it effectively because they have not enforced federal law. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  Trump was the first president to use the force of our federal laws, which are good and designed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=35.34s)]
*  to protect us, whether it was Romania, Mexico, or whether it was Title 42, or it was stopping [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=40.5s)]
*  catch and release, basic common sense things like building a wall. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=44.78s)]
*  Those things work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=47.92s)]
*  They just absolutely work. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=48.92s)]
*  And just what he's done in the first couple of days is significant and changing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=49.92s)]
*  Or Biden was taking us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=54.62s)]
*  So one of the things you pointed out off camera was his executive order designating the drug [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=76.78s)]
*  cartels as terror organizations is significant. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  Yes, we as states don't have much authority to stop illegal immigration, but the federal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=83.98s)]
*  government has that authority. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=88.58s)]
*  By designating these cartels as terrorist organizations, now our military force can [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=90.18s)]
*  be used against them rather than just using border patrol and leaving the states subject [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  to the cartels' crimes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=101.62s)]
*  You do wonder about the power of the drug cartels. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=105.42s)]
*  A lot of the weapons we've sent to Ukraine have been sold by the Ukrainian military onto [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=110.5s)]
*  the black market. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=114.7s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=115.7s)]
*  A lot, up to half. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=116.7s)]
*  And a lot of them have been purchased by the drug cartels you see in Mexico. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=118.06s)]
*  Pitched battles, military engagements between the cartels and the Mexican military, where [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=122.1s)]
*  they're very well-armed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=126.5s)]
*  Are you worried about that happening in Texas? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=130.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=132.34s)]
*  I think the Biden administration has indirectly funded the cartels. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=133.34s)]
*  They have encouraged, by saying no deportations on day one of his administration, they've [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=135.62s)]
*  encouraged illegal immigration and that's a profit center for the cartels. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=140.82s)]
*  They make $8,000 to $12,000 a person. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=145.62s)]
*  If you just do the numbers on $14 million, that's a lot of money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=148.5s)]
*  They're making billions every month. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=150.82s)]
*  And then they can go and use that money to buy weapons from Ukraine, which we're sending [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=152.58s)]
*  that over free. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=157.5s)]
*  So indirectly, they're part of the whole process, one, allowing the cartels to have access to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=158.5s)]
*  our country and allowing them to make a profit and then to use that money to arm themselves [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=162.62s)]
*  in a significant way. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=167.46s)]
*  That's our government. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=170.22s)]
*  Well, it's horrifying. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=171.22s)]
*  I mean, because some of the weapons are surface to air weapons. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=172.22s)]
*  So you wonder, what's the threat to commercial air travel? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=175.84s)]
*  You can see things kind of starting to fall apart. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=178.4s)]
*  Is there widespread acknowledgement of this in Texas that we could have a serious problem [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=181.8s)]
*  with these cartels? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=187.34s)]
*  I think even just common people are aware of that just because of the influx and the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=189.06s)]
*  increased crime associated with just everyday crime that people see as it relates to the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=195.22s)]
*  cartels moving into our state. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=200.94s)]
*  And that network that they built is not just in Texas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=202.62s)]
*  They are building that network all over the country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=205.02s)]
*  They're not going to want to give it up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=207.22s)]
*  They're making too much money on drugs, sex trafficking, other crimes, and the importation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=208.82s)]
*  of people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=214.08s)]
*  Every big construction site in this country has prostitution run by the cartels, often [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=215.84s)]
*  of children. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=220.88s)]
*  I don't see anyone doing anything about it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=221.88s)]
*  And it makes you wonder, like Mexico is completely, utterly corrupt because of cartel money. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=224.28s)]
*  Politicians, judges, journalists, all in the payroll. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=231.2s)]
*  You see this in other Latin American countries. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=234.36s)]
*  I mean, our politicians are not that expensive. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=237.04s)]
*  Like, you could do that in a state like Texas, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=240.24s)]
*  Or California. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=242.4s)]
*  Well, here's one of the biggest problems we have. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=243.4s)]
*  We have it in Texas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=244.4s)]
*  We have it in other parts of the country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  George Soros has figured this out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=246.6s)]
*  He's gone in and elected DAs in Democratic counties. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=248.96s)]
*  Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  So 70% of our population controlled by Soros DAs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  He went in and knocked off Democratic DAs because we can't get elected Republicans in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=259.32s)]
*  those areas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=263.32s)]
*  So he went in and knocked off DAs who were actually prosecuting and replaced them with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=264.88s)]
*  Soros DAs. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=268.44s)]
*  Now our legislature could fix that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=270.0s)]
*  They haven't. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=271.88s)]
*  They could come in and say, AG, you have concurrent jurisdiction to go after these [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=272.88s)]
*  crimes. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=276.0s)]
*  But because they haven't done that, crime is proliferating in all of our cities. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=277.0s)]
*  Financial crimes, other types of crimes, because they will not prosecute crimes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=281.04s)]
*  And so the cartels have an open invitation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=284.08s)]
*  So do other cartels from other countries. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=286.24s)]
*  So if you go out to our financial crime unit in Tyler, they will tell you about all these [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=288.62s)]
*  crime groups coming in from other countries because they know they can get away with it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=292.8s)]
*  And our legislature so far has not fixed that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=298.64s)]
*  Why, then the question of motive arises. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=301.44s)]
*  Why wouldn't you want to stop crime in your state? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=304.76s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=307.44s)]
*  I find that DAs have more power in Texas than any elected official I've ever seen because [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=308.84s)]
*  they're not accountable to anybody. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=314.4s)]
*  If they commit a crime, no one can prosecute them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=316.28s)]
*  If it's a state crime, they'd have to prosecute themselves. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=318.24s)]
*  And they can allow any crimes in their area. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=320.72s)]
*  And they can go after, in Texas, it is so easy to get an indictment. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=322.32s)]
*  You just walk in, you can tell the grand jury anything you want to. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=324.96s)]
*  You can lie. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=327.2s)]
*  Once you have the indictment, you've got it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=328.32s)]
*  There's no getting out of it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=330.04s)]
*  And so I think a lot of our politicians are afraid of their DAs, even if they're liberal [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=331.32s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=334.96s)]
*  But if we don't get control of this in our state, in other states, and give somebody [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=335.96s)]
*  like the attorney general, I'm not going to be there forever, give that authority so [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  that there's another way to prosecute when the Soros DAs, and Soros has figured it out, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=343.0s)]
*  but the Republicans have not. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=347.64s)]
*  I mean, it's so obvious just in your 45 second explanation that it makes sense. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  Is it that they haven't figured it out, or do they have a higher loyalty? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=358.0s)]
*  They're afraid of the DAs. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  They're afraid the DAs come in and lobby. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  Everybody's afraid of their own DA that they'll get indicted if they do it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=365.2s)]
*  There's just that power because to get an indictment in Texas, you don't have to have, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=368.24s)]
*  there's no recording of it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=373.32s)]
*  It's only one side of the story. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=374.46s)]
*  You can, if they lie and they get the indictment, there's no remedy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=376.56s)]
*  There's no consequence to the DA and there's no remedy for the victim of that lie. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  You are going to trial. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  If somehow you could find out what happened in that secret grand jury proceeding, which [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  I have before, it doesn't matter. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=391.58s)]
*  You can go to judge and say they lied. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=393.82s)]
*  You still are indicted and you're still at risk of going to prison. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=395.74s)]
*  You have to tell your kids you've been indicted. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=398.26s)]
*  And you might be in prison. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  You might be in front of a jury that doesn't know the truth and you go to jail or you're [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  in a Democratic county, you might go to jail on something that they made up. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=405.86s)]
*  So you really think, I mean, I'm sorry to be so naive, but I grew up in this country [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=410.58s)]
*  and we didn't have things like this that I was aware of in 1985. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=414.42s)]
*  But you think that members of the Texas legislature are afraid they'll be indicted if they push [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=417.94s)]
*  back against the DAs? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  I think there is a fear and there is this lobby effort. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=426.46s)]
*  These DAs have so much power. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=429.78s)]
*  Otherwise, why would they allow Soros to control the major cities? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=431.94s)]
*  And it's obvious that they're not prosecuting crimes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=438.62s)]
*  They won't even prosecute shoplifting. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=441.7s)]
*  Free ride. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=444.62s)]
*  As long as you take $750 a day in Dallas County or whatever the number is and you go to different [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=445.62s)]
*  stores, you can do that every day. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=450.06s)]
*  The DA there said, we will not prosecute you. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  But why would you want that unless you were trying to destroy a civilization? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  Soros, that's exactly what he wants to do. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=458.06s)]
*  There's no political goal here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  It's just destabilization. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=463.14000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=464.14000000000004s)]
*  It is so easy. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=465.14000000000004s)]
*  It is literally so easy to do that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=466.14000000000004s)]
*  And he also, I believe, got control of our Court of Criminal Appeals, which is our highest [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=468.38s)]
*  court. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=472.18s)]
*  We have a dedicated system in Texas. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=473.38s)]
*  We have the Texas Supreme Court, that's the final appeal in civil, and the Court of Criminal [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=474.38s)]
*  Appeals. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=478.5s)]
*  But no one knew who they were. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=479.5s)]
*  And suddenly, they strike down a law that allowed me to, that directed me to prosecute [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=480.7s)]
*  voter fraud. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=484.38s)]
*  And they took it away just by saying, oh, it's unconstitutional because you're in the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=485.38s)]
*  executive branch and separation of power says you can't be in court. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=488.26s)]
*  How insane is that? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=492.1s)]
*  So I've had to go run three, I'm trying to take that court back. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=493.42s)]
*  But right now, I can't even prosecute voter fraud, which opens us up to unfair elections. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=497.7s)]
*  Which I was prosecuting plenty of voter fraud before that happened. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=504.09999999999997s)]
*  So who's supposed to prosecute voter fraud? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=509.06s)]
*  The Soros DA's. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=511.5s)]
*  That's where we're at in Texas. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=514.9s)]
*  So that's why I ran, this is a nine-member court, six-year terms. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=515.9s)]
*  They waited until two days after the filing deadline to announce their decision. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=520.06s)]
*  This is a 1951 statute that has thousands of cases of precedent. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=523.66s)]
*  And they came up with this insane idea that it was unconstitutional for the attorney general [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=527.58s)]
*  to be in court because I'm in the executive branch. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=531.9000000000001s)]
*  If that's true, every AG in the country is violating the Congress Constitution. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=534.58s)]
*  So that was the rationale. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=538.5400000000001s)]
*  I had to wait two years. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=540.34s)]
*  I recruited three people to take out the three people that were up. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=541.34s)]
*  So we've replaced three. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=544.1s)]
*  We've got one good one on there, but we're still down five-four. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=545.1s)]
*  So until we fix those things in Texas, we're at risk. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, big time. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=552.46s)]
*  Oh, big time. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=553.46s)]
*  So do you think that these Soros DA's have hesitated to go after the drug cartels? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=555.02s)]
*  They don't. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=562.3s)]
*  They don't go after crime in general. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=564.26s)]
*  They don't work. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=566.22s)]
*  They do political crimes, but they generally are not there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=567.22s)]
*  They don't do their jobs. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=571.68s)]
*  They don't prosecute. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=572.68s)]
*  Even when people get killed? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=573.68s)]
*  Hit and miss, hit and miss. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  But they're not, the message from Soros is let as much crime go as possible. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=578.98s)]
*  It's amazing that a non-U.S. citizen who hates the United States, hates the West, could have [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=584.74s)]
*  that much power in our country. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=589.7s)]
*  It's just his money. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=591.14s)]
*  It doesn't take very much. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=592.14s)]
*  To elect a DA in a Travis County, which is Austin, you're in a Democratic primary. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=593.14s)]
*  It doesn't take that many votes. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=598.26s)]
*  I was working with a DA there who was a Democrat. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=600.62s)]
*  I didn't agree with her on everything, but she was doing her job. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=603.46s)]
*  He spends a little bit of money, takes her out, and suddenly now I've got a DA who won't [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=606.78s)]
*  prosecute anything. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=610.26s)]
*  Same in Bear County, which is San Antonio. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=611.26s)]
*  I worked with a DA a lot in Bear County, a guy named Nicola Hood. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=613.0200000000001s)]
*  His brother is now converted to Republican. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  He's a state rep. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=618.0200000000001s)]
*  He was awesome to work with. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  And he was a Democrat. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=621.1400000000001s)]
*  He was a Democrat. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=622.1400000000001s)]
*  He did his job. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=623.26s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=624.26s)]
*  Soros replaced him with money. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=625.26s)]
*  So that's what, it doesn't take him that much money and controls our whole situation with [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  crime and controls our judicial system, at least on the criminal side. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=632.22s)]
*  And we're sitting here letting it happen in Texas and other states. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=636.1400000000001s)]
*  What did you think when Joe Biden gave George Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=639.54s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=643.18s)]
*  I mean, the guy's done more to, I mean, as far as I know, there are not many people in [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=644.18s)]
*  the world that have done more harm to our country. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=648.2199999999999s)]
*  And he's being applauded by Joe Biden. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=650.78s)]
*  It's not surprising because Joe Biden has the same motivations. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=652.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=655.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what did Joe Biden do that was good? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=656.0999999999999s)]
*  Can you name it? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=658.8199999999999s)]
*  I can't think of it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=659.8199999999999s)]
*  No, they worked from day one to destroy what past generations had built this amazing country. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=660.8199999999999s)]
*  And it had to be on purpose. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=664.9s)]
*  The reason I say this is because you would think that randomly he would have done something [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=666.06s)]
*  good if it weren't purposeful. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=670.1s)]
*  He would have had something economically, internationally, the board, something would [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=672.86s)]
*  have been right, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=677.1s)]
*  Just randomly. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=678.34s)]
*  The law of averages suggests a victory once in a while. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=679.34s)]
*  The bell curve tells you he would have had something good. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=683.1s)]
*  He didn't have anything good. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=685.34s)]
*  It was all on the other end of the curve, the downside of the curve, which was harm [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=686.34s)]
*  to Americans. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=689.3s)]
*  That cannot be accidental. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=690.46s)]
*  And to individual Americans, I think that's absolutely right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=692.1s)]
*  But again, I just I'm so fixated on this. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=694.46s)]
*  Why would you want to do that? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=696.62s)]
*  I truly believe that this and this started, I think, with President Obama, first president, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=700.22s)]
*  I believe that didn't love America, that really thought we were a bad country, that thought [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=704.5s)]
*  we were racist and that we deserve to be taken down to another level. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=708.26s)]
*  And I think they operate under this idea that we're a bad country, there were bad people [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=713.26s)]
*  and that we we don't deserve this. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=716.7s)]
*  And they fundamentally don't believe in what was created here. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=719.02s)]
*  I truly believe that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=722.22s)]
*  And they want to destroy it, take it down, dismantle it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=723.38s)]
*  Because they think it's bad. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=725.46s)]
*  They think we're bad. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=726.46s)]
*  I don't see another explanation. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=728.5s)]
*  There's hate behind it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=729.98s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=730.98s)]
*  I mean, how could you how could you wind up with it with the outcome with people dying [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=731.98s)]
*  of drug odies on the street and stores closing because of stealing and kids cutting their [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=734.98s)]
*  own genitals off like you would have to hate someone. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=740.6600000000001s)]
*  You know, the contempt that Biden, not Biden, Obama said they cling to their religion and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=743.46s)]
*  their their guns and their their God. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=748.0600000000001s)]
*  There is contempt for that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=751.14s)]
*  What the founders put in place, a bunch of white racists who had slaves. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=752.82s)]
*  And so that that permeates his view of America. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=756.5400000000001s)]
*  And yet that's not there's no excuse for slavery. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=760.58s)]
*  We messed up in that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=764.1800000000001s)]
*  We had we fixed it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  We were moving in the right direction. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=766.1800000000001s)]
*  But his view is we're broken because of that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=767.7s)]
*  And therefore, we deserve to be dismantled because we don't. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=771.1s)]
*  It's not about that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=774.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are countries where slavery is still practiced in certain countries. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  There were like critical US allies that had slavery until the 1970s and no one ever 1970s. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=780.66s)]
*  And no one ever mentions that holds them responsible. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=786.9s)]
*  Obama has no problem taking money for speeches in those countries. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=789.58s)]
*  That's why it doesn't make sense. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=792.66s)]
*  It's slavery around the world forever. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=794.06s)]
*  And it's not awful. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=795.78s)]
*  It is awful. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=797.26s)]
*  And the US and Great Britain were the reason that we don't have it anymore. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=797.98s)]
*  And globally, for the most part, and no civilized country would tolerate slavery. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=801.62s)]
*  But if you're against slavery, by the way, why would you be for the drug cartels, which [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=806.62s)]
*  practice slavery, which sell people? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=809.98s)]
*  All I know is it seems like the things they focus on do the greatest harm to America. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=811.94s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=816.5s)]
*  But it does. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=817.46s)]
*  I think it's a mistake to take their explanations at face value. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=818.14s)]
*  I think there's something deeper like they just hate want to hurt people. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=820.94s)]
*  They do not have an abiding love. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=824.02s)]
*  Look, I didn't like Jimmy Carter as a president. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=825.5s)]
*  I think he did a good job. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=827.4200000000001s)]
*  But he didn't have a hatred for this country. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=828.38s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=830.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't think he did. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=831.0600000000001s)]
*  I think I think we've had a lot of mediocre to bad presidents who still didn't want the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=832.1s)]
*  country to be just I agree. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=837.66s)]
*  But I think it started with Obama. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=839.94s)]
*  Biden didn't know what he was doing. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=841.7800000000001s)]
*  He's being told by others he was incompetent and that this was the third presidency of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=843.62s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=849.1400000000001s)]
*  And he didn't have to worry about being popular anymore because he limited himself a little [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=850.1400000000001s)]
*  bit because he wanted to get reelected. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=853.94s)]
*  He didn't care if Joe Biden got reelected. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=854.94s)]
*  You think it's over for Obama? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=857.46s)]
*  His influence is permanently diminished. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=859.94s)]
*  I think it's been impacted and affected. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=862.86s)]
*  It could be if we continue the momentum, we don't mess this up. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=865.3800000000001s)]
*  If we if we get caught up and not focusing on the best things for America, he can come [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=869.0999999999999s)]
*  right back in. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=875.42s)]
*  If we don't take care of the American people and make that our number one focus, what's [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=876.42s)]
*  best for the American people? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=880.66s)]
*  If we stay on that track, we have a really good chance of being successful for a long [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  time. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=885.3s)]
*  If we lose sight of that and we start worrying about our power and our I agree, we once we [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=886.3s)]
*  start taking care of ourselves, then they have a chance back in because the American [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=890.18s)]
*  people see that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=894.14s)]
*  I think that's really wise. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=895.14s)]
*  I'm concerned about that, not because of any individual acting in bad faith, but because [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=898.18s)]
*  human nature, the depravity of what it is. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=903.98s)]
*  It's exactly right. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=906.66s)]
*  The Presbyterians actually had that right when they set this government up. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=907.66s)]
*  It was based on the depravity of men. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  It was the reason they wanted three branches of government that made it so frustrating [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=913.58s)]
*  to get things done is because they didn't trust people in power because every human [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=918.1s)]
*  I wouldn't trust myself in power at all. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=922.22s)]
*  I don't want power because I don't trust myself. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=925.14s)]
*  I don't think any honest person can really say my motives are pure. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=927.3000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=931.9s)]
*  No, I agree with that. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=932.9s)]
*  We all have this pull towards. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=934.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=936.94s)]
*  And anyone who doesn't admit that's a liar. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=937.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=939.4200000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, I want oversight of me. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=940.4200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=942.3000000000001s)]
*  And then you see Chuck Schumer and you're like, that guy needs a lot of oversight, like [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=943.3000000000001s)]
*  armed oversight. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=946.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=947.1s)]
*  Like all of us. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=948.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=949.1s)]
*  I think you got it right in your speech at the Bible Museum during the inauguration about [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=950.1s)]
*  realizing your need for God's work in your life. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=953.94s)]
*  And without that, you have a tent. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=958.34s)]
*  We all have a tendency to go down the path. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=960.74s)]
*  And you lie to yourself. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=962.74s)]
*  I'm doing this for the greater good. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=963.98s)]
*  You know, I have known people personally who've killed other human beings because they thought [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=966.82s)]
*  they convinced themselves, you know, this is actually for the, you know, some humanity [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=972.1s)]
*  will benefit. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=976.1400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=977.1400000000001s)]
*  That's what we all can do. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=978.74s)]
*  Whatever we're doing, that we're doing this, and it really, we tell ourselves, well, this [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=979.74s)]
*  is really good because we are off face many times. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=984.42s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=989.0600000000001s)]
*  So the whole point of market capitalism is consumer choice. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=990.0600000000001s)]
*  You have a choice between products and services and the competition between companies makes [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=994.88s)]
*  the goods and services better. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1001.14s)]
*  That's the core idea. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1003.26s)]
*  Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of monopolies out there. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1004.74s)]
*  Monopolies are not good for consumers. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1008.38s)]
*  They are not good for you. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1009.9399999999999s)]
*  And one of the places where there's effectively a monopoly is in wireless contracts, but it's [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1011.98s)]
*  not a complete monopoly. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1016.14s)]
*  You're probably paying way too much to use your cell phone. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1017.9s)]
*  But now you have a choice. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1022.48s)]
*  You don't have to pay a hundred bucks a month just to get a free phone. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1023.48s)]
*  That's not a good deal. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1027.18s)]
*  There's a company called Pure Talk, which we use, that has no inflated prices. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1028.56s)]
*  plan of just $45 a month, you can choose a free phone, an iPhone 14 or a Samsung Gallery. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1033.9s)]
*  Then you get unlimited talk, tax 25 gigs of data, which is enough for most people, a mobile [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1040.02s)]
*  hotspot, all for that low price. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1044.94s)]
*  And it's got the most dependable 5G network. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1048.02s)]
*  So you get your free iPhone 14 or Samsung Galaxy by visiting puretalk.com slash Tucker, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1050.5s)]
*  and you switch to Pure Talk today. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1056.2s)]
*  America's wireless company, Pure Talk. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1058.3000000000002s)]
*  So can I ask you, I was reading in the final weeks before the election that the Biden administration [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1060.16s)]
*  was selling off portions of the materials for the border wall. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1067.28s)]
*  Is that actually true? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1069.64s)]
*  I believe it is. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1070.64s)]
*  And here's what happened. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1071.8000000000002s)]
*  We had sued the Biden administration a couple of years ago. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1072.8000000000002s)]
*  And you know, these cases, these federal cases don't happen overnight. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1075.8000000000002s)]
*  It took us a couple of years. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1078.68s)]
*  We sued them and we said, Congress appropriated money for the building of the wall. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1079.68s)]
*  You are not building that wall. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1084.78s)]
*  You're actually selling off assets. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1085.78s)]
*  So we sued them. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1086.78s)]
*  We won that lawsuit. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1088.28s)]
*  And in May, we got an injunction from a federal judge saying you, DOJ, you, Biden administration, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1089.56s)]
*  cannot sell any more assets off. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  So then I get a call from President Trump, you know, a month ago, and he said, they're [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1096.92s)]
*  selling assets off. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1100.12s)]
*  So would you sue them? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1101.8s)]
*  And I said, I don't have to if I were done it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1102.8s)]
*  Why are we getting an order? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1104.8s)]
*  So we go back into court, we tell the judge, hey, they're selling off assets. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  We've been told they're selling off assets. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1110.16s)]
*  We went into accounting. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1111.22s)]
*  And before we got there, DOJ is calling us, begging us, hey, we're not selling, we swear [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1112.6s)]
*  we won't sell any more assets. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1117.1799999999998s)]
*  They didn't say they hadn't. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1118.1799999999998s)]
*  They said we won't sell any more. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1119.1799999999998s)]
*  So they signed an agreement, they said they wouldn't sell any more. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1120.58s)]
*  But the judge, which we asked for, there's going to be an accounting and there's potential [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1122.62s)]
*  sanctions if they lied and they follow, they did not follow that order. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1127.06s)]
*  We don't know that yet. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1130.4199999999998s)]
*  We're going to know that soon now that DOJ is switching. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1131.4199999999998s)]
*  We're going to know that soon. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1134.26s)]
*  And I truly believe they were selling off assets in violation, not only of federal law, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1135.26s)]
*  but in violation of a court order that we got in May saying you can't sell off assets [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1140.58s)]
*  because we were trying to protect those assets so that if Trump won, we would come because [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1144.5s)]
*  I knew Biden would never build that wall, even if he was instructed by Congress to do [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1149.18s)]
*  so. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1152.94s)]
*  How hard is it? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1153.94s)]
*  I never really understood why is it so hard to build a seems like a pretty straightforward [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1154.94s)]
*  infrastructure project. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1158.78s)]
*  It is a pretty straightforward infrastructure project, but they hate it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1159.78s)]
*  It's some kind of symbol of, I don't know, racism or whatever, but it's not. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1163.0600000000002s)]
*  It protects us from exactly what we've had. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1167.54s)]
*  So why not pass a law that says anyone, any elected official who opposes the building [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1169.8600000000001s)]
*  of a border wall is prohibited from putting a lock on the front door of his house? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1174.08s)]
*  Well, that would affect a lot of Republicans. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1178.28s)]
*  I mean, my own senator would have trouble with that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1179.6s)]
*  John Cornyn, because he's been against the border wall saying it wouldn't work. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  But we all know that walls do work. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1185.8799999999999s)]
*  They do work. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1187.28s)]
*  And I've seen it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1188.28s)]
*  I've seen how it works. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1189.28s)]
*  The border patrol. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1190.28s)]
*  Why would John Cornyn be opposed to a border wall protecting his own state? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1191.28s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1194.8799999999999s)]
*  I've seen quotes from him. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1196.36s)]
*  I've seen video clips from him over and over how it's not enough. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1197.6399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1201.96s)]
*  It's a bad idea. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1202.96s)]
*  He is opposed to the border wall. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1204.8400000000001s)]
*  But he's, I mean, boy, he's helped appropriate billions and billions and billions of dollars [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1205.8400000000001s)]
*  for border security in other countries. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1209.48s)]
*  I know. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1211.32s)]
*  It's really odd that he thinks it works other places, but it doesn't work in Texas. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1212.32s)]
*  And he's sort of mocked it and said it doesn't work. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1215.68s)]
*  It's not effective. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1219.64s)]
*  I'd love to hear him mock Israel's border walls. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1220.64s)]
*  Do you think he will? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  I'd love to hear him mock Ukraine's territorial integrity. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1224.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you think he will? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1226.72s)]
*  Nope. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1227.72s)]
*  Never heard him do that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1228.72s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1229.72s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1230.72s)]
*  I think the Bushes had the same idea that open borders were relatively good. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1232.48s)]
*  I don't think that he or the Bushes... [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  But only for us. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1239.28s)]
*  No one's calling on China to open its borders. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1240.28s)]
*  I don't know why they have this view. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1242.28s)]
*  But even under the Bush presidency, I don't think they took immigration seriously. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1244.84s)]
*  The first president I've ever seen take it seriously is Donald J. Trump. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1249.0s)]
*  How did John, I mean, this is a question I could ask of so many, no offense. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1252.1200000000001s)]
*  I say this as a Texas lover who's got a lot of relatives there, including a child. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1255.56s)]
*  So I love Texas. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1259.34s)]
*  However, I think you've got some of the worst politicians in the country. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1260.9599999999998s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1266.1599999999999s)]
*  So I think about the Texas House and what's going on there. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1268.08s)]
*  What's gone on there for 16 years where a small group of Republicans for power align [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1272.8s)]
*  themselves in the House with the Democrats so that the speaker is elected by mostly Democrats [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1278.36s)]
*  and a few Republicans. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1282.52s)]
*  They just did it again. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1283.52s)]
*  Dustin Burrows just got elected by a minority of Republicans after he put the rules in place [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1284.52s)]
*  that the caucus, the Republican caucus, would decide who the speaker was. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1289.68s)]
*  And when he lost that vote in caucus, he walked out, cut a deal with the Democrats, and he [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1293.44s)]
*  just became Speaker of the Texas House. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1297.8s)]
*  That is for power. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1299.76s)]
*  That is for his own personal power. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1301.2s)]
*  And the Republicans that do that have traded getting good policy done, getting property [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1304.3400000000001s)]
*  tax done, school choice, protecting the border, not doing impeachments of guys that just got [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1309.54s)]
*  elected. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1314.1200000000001s)]
*  They traded that to have power. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1315.1200000000001s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1317.72s)]
*  With all this drug cartel money in your state, it's not going to get better. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1319.48s)]
*  Because you could just buy a member of the Texas legislature. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1322.28s)]
*  What would that cost? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1324.56s)]
*  Not too much, right? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1325.56s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1326.56s)]
*  I mean, these guys only make $600 a month. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1327.56s)]
*  So anything is good after that, I guess. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1329.0800000000002s)]
*  We're pretty vulnerable that way. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1331.1200000000001s)]
*  I think we are. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1332.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think a lot of these people, because Texas House, you pay $600 a month. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  So most people that run have to have money. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1337.68s)]
*  You can't. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1340.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1341.56s)]
*  And if you don't have money, you're getting paid somewhere for something because it's [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1342.56s)]
*  impossible to live on, obviously, $600 a month. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1345.3600000000001s)]
*  Everybody has to either work, and it's hard to work when you've got a job that may take [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1348.44s)]
*  a year out of every two years. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1353.16s)]
*  So specifically on John Cornyn, how did he get to be a senator when statewide in Texas? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1355.64s)]
*  So this goes back to George W. Bush, appointed him to be a U.S. Supreme Court judge in a [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1364.68s)]
*  not U.S. Supreme Court, but a Texas Supreme Court judge. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1371.2s)]
*  And when he did that, he authored an opinion that created this thing called Robinhood, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1374.8s)]
*  which takes from the wealthy school districts and gives to the poor supposedly. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1380.04s)]
*  And what that did to our system was it created a mediocre school system because it's just [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1383.8s)]
*  socialism. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1387.9599999999998s)]
*  Instead of just letting the wealthy school districts make their schools however they [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1388.9599999999998s)]
*  want to, we've got to take their money away. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1391.56s)]
*  Why don't we just fund the poor school districts? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1394.9599999999998s)]
*  But I think- [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1396.04s)]
*  Because it's not about helping the bottom, it's about crushing the top. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1397.04s)]
*  It's about making it all equal. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1399.9599999999998s)]
*  That's socialism. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1401.84s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1402.84s)]
*  And we have no example that it actually works. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1403.8799999999999s)]
*  So and yet John Cornyn did that for George W. Bush because George wanted to be president. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1405.9199999999998s)]
*  He didn't want to pass a major tax increase, so he let John do it judicially. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1411.28s)]
*  It was a 5-4 decision. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1414.48s)]
*  John Cornyn was on the 5-4. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1416.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1417.0s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure he authored it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1418.0s)]
*  This was in the late 90s. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1419.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1420.8s)]
*  And for that, they pushed him, Roeve and Bush, pushed him to be the Attorney General of Texas, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1421.8s)]
*  first Republican actually, and then they pushed him into the U.S. Senate. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1427.04s)]
*  So he has been pushed and funded by that group. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1430.32s)]
*  And fortunately, Texans have caught onto that and realized that group, whatever they say [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1433.76s)]
*  they believe, isn't really what they believe because they don't actually follow through [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1439.6s)]
*  on it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1443.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, we kind of know what Bush believes. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, his family's out there campaigning for Planned Parenthood, voting for Kamala [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1447.52s)]
*  Harris. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1451.52s)]
*  I was with him two days ago and Obama at the inaugurations right next to them, across from [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1452.52s)]
*  him. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1457.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, he's friends with Obama. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1459.44s)]
*  That's his world. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1461.5200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1462.5200000000002s)]
*  That's his world. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1463.5200000000002s)]
*  That's all well known. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1464.5200000000002s)]
*  But what's pretty distressing was running mate endorsed Kamala Harris and his sad little [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1465.5200000000002s)]
*  daughter campaigned for Kamala Harris. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1471.0800000000002s)]
*  So that whole world is now, they're all Democrats. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1473.66s)]
*  But John Cornyn is still an elected statewide elected official in Texas. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1476.2s)]
*  He's a puppet of the left, obviously. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1480.6000000000001s)]
*  How does that continue to happen? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1483.88s)]
*  So I think it's because people weren't as aware of what the Bushes did and what he's [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1485.84s)]
*  done, but they've become more aware because of people like you and others who have outed [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1490.56s)]
*  that. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1495.4399999999998s)]
*  So he's never had a real problem. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1496.4399999999998s)]
*  He had four people running against him. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1497.9199999999998s)]
*  None of them had money. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1499.48s)]
*  Nobody had ever run before. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1500.48s)]
*  No one even knew who they were. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1501.48s)]
*  It was all fake. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1502.48s)]
*  And he claims, you know, you got 76% of it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1503.48s)]
*  Of course, he had nobody running against him. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1504.84s)]
*  I could tell you who it was. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1507.24s)]
*  And I'm pretty involved in politics. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1508.6799999999998s)]
*  Somebody needs to run against him this time because he has been there for what, 16 years? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1510.9599999999998s)]
*  He's in that position. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1515.08s)]
*  Count as AG. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1516.08s)]
*  That's four years. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1517.08s)]
*  He was a Texas Supreme Court justice. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1518.08s)]
*  And before that, he's been doing this a long time and he's gotten away with this. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1520.96s)]
*  It's about time that he be held accountable because I can't think of a single thing that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1524.3600000000001s)]
*  he's done for Texas that's good. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1527.24s)]
*  He has no claim for doing things good for Texas or our country. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1530.52s)]
*  No, he's helped Zelensky and that's pretty much it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1535.16s)]
*  So how do, okay, so what's the process? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1537.88s)]
*  The guy, I mean, I've never met anyone who likes John Cornyn. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1540.88s)]
*  I've never met anyone who thought he's achieved anything. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1544.6s)]
*  Never met anyone who thinks he's smart. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1546.16s)]
*  He's pompous. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1548.24s)]
*  He's quite a self-righteous little guy. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1549.24s)]
*  So I think he's very unpopular with every person I've ever met in my life. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1551.72s)]
*  And yet all things being equal, he gets reelected. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1555.3999999999999s)]
*  So how do you, how do you stop something like that? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1558.28s)]
*  So I'll give you an example of what you're just saying. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1561.32s)]
*  So to right after I beat George P. Bush, who he came out and endorsed, of course, and then [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1563.08s)]
*  He made disparaging comments about me being an embarrassment to Texas. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1570.52s)]
*  And he made some comment about me being part of Russia propaganda. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1573.88s)]
*  You're a Russian propaganda. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1579.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know how that happened. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1580.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm in Texas. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1581.0800000000002s)]
*  I became part of the Russian propaganda because I criticized him on Ukraine. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1582.0800000000002s)]
*  He said that you were a Russian propaganda. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1585.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1587.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1588.24s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1589.24s)]
*  Crazy stuff. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1590.24s)]
*  You know, people didn't used to say things like that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1591.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1592.24s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1593.24s)]
*  So who's a more loyal American, you or John Cornyn? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1594.24s)]
*  Who's more focused on the fortunes of his own country and his own people? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1596.96s)]
*  You or John Cornyn, who obviously doesn't care at all, didn't say anything as his own [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1599.6s)]
*  state was invaded and lectures us endlessly. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1602.44s)]
*  So tool of the Intel agencies lecturing us about Ukraine. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1605.36s)]
*  But you're the disloyal American. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  It's actually like you shouldn't say things like that. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1610.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1612.8799999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1613.8799999999999s)]
*  And so justice, the crazy thing, we have a text from Republican convention shortly after [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  the election where I win by 38 points against George P. Bush, which is a pretty significant [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1619.76s)]
*  margin and a primary. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1624.24s)]
*  So we have the convention, there's 12,000 Republicans there. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1626.04s)]
*  He and his wife walk up on stage and for 10 straight minutes, he doesn't say a word, he [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1629.08s)]
*  gets booed for the 20 minutes that he's speaking. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1632.12s)]
*  He never adjusts his speech. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1634.6s)]
*  He gets booed the entire 20 minutes. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1635.6s)]
*  He gets booed 30 minutes straight. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1637.2s)]
*  I'm standing waiting to go on stage. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1639.1599999999999s)]
*  I walk away because I'm afraid of what I might say after he said these things public to me. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1640.96s)]
*  I go up and get a standing ovation. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1645.0s)]
*  So there is the people of Texas know John Cornyn and I don't think he'll survive another [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1646.68s)]
*  primary. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1652.08s)]
*  So how do you stop this cycle? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1653.08s)]
*  So I think in Texas, it's very doable because people realize now who John Cornyn is. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1655.0800000000002s)]
*  We have a primary next, not this March, but the next March. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1659.4s)]
*  So somebody needs to run against him in that primary. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1662.18s)]
*  So in a year, basically in a year and two months, you have a primary. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1665.2s)]
*  So that primary. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1668.4s)]
*  It's imminent. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1669.4s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1670.4s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1671.4s)]
*  So he's, I don't think he's long for this Senate world. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1672.4s)]
*  So while I'm sure he's got such an enormous reservoir of skills and talent that he'll [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1677.0800000000002s)]
*  thrive in the private sector. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1681.64s)]
*  I don't know if he's ever been there. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1685.0s)]
*  He couldn't start my truck on a cold day. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1687.0800000000002s)]
*  He has no idea. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1688.8s)]
*  He has no skills. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1689.8s)]
*  But anyway, sorry, I'm being too mean, but it's all true. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1690.8s)]
*  How do you, how do you beat him in a primary? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1696.0800000000002s)]
*  So I mean, I don't know. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm running for sure. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1702.16s)]
*  I'm looking at it probably in the next few months. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1703.16s)]
*  I'll be talking to people around the state, but I mean, I've run two primaries against [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1704.88s)]
*  George P. Bush and another guy, Dan Branch, who was one of George's close friends. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1709.52s)]
*  I knew Dan Branch. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1712.3600000000001s)]
*  One of his close friends, but very moderate. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1713.4799999999998s)]
*  And I beat him nicer to you than he was to me. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1716.8s)]
*  I served in the House with one always so nice to me. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1720.28s)]
*  65-35 him with, he had a lot more money. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1723.36s)]
*  Same with Bush. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1727.0s)]
*  I beat him 68-32. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1728.0s)]
*  So primary voters, if they're educated, will make good choices based on what you've actually [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1729.0s)]
*  done. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1734.76s)]
*  And that was always me. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1735.76s)]
*  With Dan Branch, we were in the House together for 10 years and I moved over to the Senate [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1736.76s)]
*  for two while he was in the House. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1739.04s)]
*  And I said, don't listen to the rhetoric. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1740.76s)]
*  Look at the record. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1743.32s)]
*  We both have a record. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1744.32s)]
*  Go look at the record, compare them, see if they're the same. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1745.32s)]
*  They're not. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1746.8s)]
*  He can say what he wants. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1747.8799999999999s)]
*  He is not what he's, he's running on my record. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1749.28s)]
*  Look at his record. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1752.1599999999999s)]
*  And that works in primaries. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1753.36s)]
*  And the same thing with John Cornyn. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1755.32s)]
*  I bring out what he said about Trump and how disparaging he was of Trump in 2016 and 2000, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1756.52s)]
*  just in those last elections saying he shouldn't run. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1761.76s)]
*  He's not the right guy. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1763.6s)]
*  I mean, John's wrong about most everything. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1764.6s)]
*  There's very few things. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1766.9199999999998s)]
*  He tends to side with the swamp in Washington and he does what Karl Rove tells him to do. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1767.9199999999998s)]
*  So that doesn't work in Republican primaries, not in Texas. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1772.32s)]
*  What does Karl Rove have? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1777.04s)]
*  I mean, Karl Rove is, I mean, he's got to be 70 anyway at this point, I would think. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1778.04s)]
*  He's been around, I mean, I've known him for pushing 30 years. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1782.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think his track record is something anyone could brag about at all. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1787.32s)]
*  He's been wrong about, he's a sub genius, I would say, for sure. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1791.8s)]
*  I'm a genius. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1796.36s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1797.36s)]
*  And his records suggest he's not. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1798.6799999999998s)]
*  And so like, why does he still have influence? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  Is he still effective? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1802.68s)]
*  Let's be honest, he's propped up by Fox News. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1803.68s)]
*  He has the platform, they take care of him. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1805.92s)]
*  He can keep people like, for instance, I can't get on Fox News anymore. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1808.16s)]
*  He's still on Fox News? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1810.84s)]
*  He's still on Fox News and he's kept me off for a couple years because when I ran against [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1811.84s)]
*  Bush, they got Bush on and took me off and all the shows I used to be on, almost all [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1815.76s)]
*  of them. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1820.68s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1821.68s)]
*  I know that for a fact. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1822.68s)]
*  You don't have a TV that's a disadvantage. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1823.68s)]
*  Karl Rove is still on Fox. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1824.68s)]
*  He's still on Fox. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1826.12s)]
*  I just saw him during the inauguration. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1827.12s)]
*  He's there a lot. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1828.68s)]
*  I used to go in studio at the same place in Austin. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1830.3600000000001s)]
*  I used to trade out with him. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1832.28s)]
*  Yeah, I've been to that studio. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1833.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1834.8400000000001s)]
*  And he got me cut out for sure. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  And I know that from hosts of shows who have said, sorry, weak. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1837.2s)]
*  They will even like, I will have a case. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1841.8s)]
*  They will, we will get, we will, Jesse will talk to him. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1844.16s)]
*  I communicate to him, talk to him. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1847.3200000000002s)]
*  They'll book me, then they'll cancel me. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1848.8s)]
*  Then they'll go try to find another AG. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1850.5s)]
*  They'll call the Republican, can we find another AG? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1852.0800000000002s)]
*  Or they'll ask for somebody else in my office other than me. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1854.28s)]
*  That was Karl Rove, blacklisting me on Fox. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1857.54s)]
*  Karl Rove is booking shows at Fox News. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1859.48s)]
*  He just goes around and he controls. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1860.96s)]
*  He controls so crazy. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1863.0s)]
*  No, I've been told by people you know that have shows. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1864.36s)]
*  I know everyone there. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1867.9199999999998s)]
*  I just don't want to out them. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1869.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I get it. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1870.24s)]
*  That have told me we can't have you. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1871.3999999999999s)]
*  And for the last two years, I've been on Fox like maybe a couple of times. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1874.84s)]
*  I used to be on it every day. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1878.1999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes multiple times. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1879.6s)]
*  Imagine if I can just say, since I know these systems, I lived it. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1880.6s)]
*  The host of a show and you get a call saying the sitting Republican attorney general of [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1885.96s)]
*  the second biggest state is not allowed on your air because of reasons we won't explain [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1891.04s)]
*  because Karl Rove is a totally discredited buffoon, doesn't like the guy? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1896.2s)]
*  I'd be like, buzz off. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1901.44s)]
*  I think he went to Paul Ryan and the board and just got... [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1902.72s)]
*  Why would you cave to that? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1906.8799999999999s)]
*  No job is worth taking orders like that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1908.08s)]
*  You didn't cave to that. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1910.04s)]
*  Well, I got fired. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1911.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1912.04s)]
*  I wouldn't even consider that. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1913.04s)]
*  What? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1914.04s)]
*  I would always say on the three or four times they ever said anything like that to me, I'd [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1915.12s)]
*  be like, that's totally great. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1918.48s)]
*  Just put it in writing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1919.48s)]
*  Just send me an email explaining why we can't have this guest, the rationale for it, and [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1920.6s)]
*  I'll assess and I'll respond in writing. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1925.6s)]
*  The second you say put it in writing, they're like, they never call you again. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1927.6s)]
*  I'm just telling you. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1932.6s)]
*  Just put it in writing. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1933.6s)]
*  It's totally fine. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1934.6s)]
*  You know what? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1935.6s)]
*  I've got some hearing issues. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1936.6s)]
*  So if you could just write it down, explain what exactly about Ken Paxton is verboten. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1937.96s)]
*  I was supposed to go on a show. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1942.92s)]
*  There was still one host that would sort of have me and I was supposed to go on this show [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1944.4s)]
*  and I had two different settings to go on and both got canceled. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1948.5200000000002s)]
*  I was told you got canceled from the body. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1952.0400000000002s)]
*  We're moving in another direction. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1955.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1956.5200000000002s)]
*  Even if it's my case. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1957.5200000000002s)]
*  I file the case and they want another attorney general to come on and talk about it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1959.3600000000001s)]
*  I would just never put up with that. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1962.16s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1963.68s)]
*  I would always call and say, what is this? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1964.68s)]
*  Will the decisions be made by whom and why? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1967.2s)]
*  But that's why Karl Rove still has his platform. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1969.0400000000002s)]
*  It's all the most disgusting kind of power, which is like stealthy feline power, behind [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1972.2s)]
*  the scenes power. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1977.2s)]
*  Rather than just say, here are my views and this is what I think and I'm happy to debate [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1978.76s)]
*  it or whatever. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1982.72s)]
*  I think you're wrong. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1983.72s)]
*  I don't like Ken Paxton's evil. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1984.72s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1985.96s)]
*  They'll never do that because they're not honorable people. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1986.96s)]
*  I'm not talking about that company. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1990.08s)]
*  More broadly in our society, the people who win every bureaucratic battle are exactly [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1992.6s)]
*  the same. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1996.04s)]
*  They operate in darkness. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=1998.96s)]
*  They're never straightforward about anything. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2001.72s)]
*  You talked about my impeachment. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2002.72s)]
*  I came in, you were the first person I talked to about the impeachment. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2003.72s)]
*  That was how my whole impeachment went. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2006.0800000000002s)]
*  It was done in three days, no due process. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2007.64s)]
*  I didn't get any information. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2010.16s)]
*  I wasn't allowed to participate or respond all behind closed doors and then they leaked [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2011.16s)]
*  stuff to the media that's not even true and I've got a gag order on me and I can't talk. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2015.4s)]
*  It's so dishonorable. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2019.3200000000002s)]
*  How do you survive that? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2020.3200000000002s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2021.74s)]
*  Also, how do you live with yourself? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2022.74s)]
*  Like, how do you live with yourself if you operate that way? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2023.74s)]
*  They convince themselves. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2025.92s)]
*  If I don't like someone, I'm always delighted to call them on the phone and say, I don't [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2026.92s)]
*  like you and here's why. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2030.6s)]
*  They convince themselves that I deserve it because I'm a bad person because all of this [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2031.6s)]
*  stuff is true, but none of it was proof. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2035.84s)]
*  You know why? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2037.48s)]
*  Because it wasn't true. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2038.48s)]
*  But why do it behind the scenes? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2040.8s)]
*  I can tell you why. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2043.76s)]
*  So I had friends that were called into the speaker's office, Republican House members, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2045.08s)]
*  and they were saying, look, we need you to vote for this impeachment. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2049.16s)]
*  They said, well, can you just show us some evidence? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2050.8s)]
*  Well, you have this three-hour hearing. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2052.88s)]
*  Well, there's no evidence there. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2055.4s)]
*  Can we see some evidence? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2057.0s)]
*  No, you're not getting any more. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2058.0s)]
*  Can we like have a little more time to like kind of figure this out? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2059.16s)]
*  We've only had like three days. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2062.84s)]
*  We're going to vote on this in three days. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2063.84s)]
*  No, we're not giving you more time. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2065.84s)]
*  What about like, can we talk to the witnesses? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2067.4s)]
*  We don't even know who they are. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2069.32s)]
*  None of them were sworn in. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2070.32s)]
*  We don't even know who the witnesses against him are. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2071.32s)]
*  And they said, no, we're not going to let you do that. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2074.36s)]
*  And they said, well, why is it that we can't see the evidence? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2076.32s)]
*  Why is it that we can't see the witnesses? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2079.66s)]
*  Why is it that has to be in three days over Memorial weekend? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2081.64s)]
*  And they said, because if we give Ken more than three days, he'll win. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2084.2s)]
*  That's what they told them. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2088.84s)]
*  That is, you know, if you find yourself living your life like that, you have to make a change [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2089.84s)]
*  because that's really deceptive. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2094.28s)]
*  That was the Republican, supposedly the Republican House controlled by the Democrats. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2097.36s)]
*  Oh, they're all like that. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2100.6400000000003s)]
*  I got called in one time by executives of a company and they're trying to tell me that [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2101.7200000000003s)]
*  Roger Ailes was a rapist who I knew well and really loved. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2108.26s)]
*  He was a flawed guy like we all are, but I didn't feel like a rapist to me. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2112.1200000000003s)]
*  Pretty sure he wasn't a rapist. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2116.0s)]
*  I remember saying, like, OK, who did he rape? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2117.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, we know this. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2120.52s)]
*  We just know this. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2125.36s)]
*  You know, we had ropes in grade to this investigation. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2126.36s)]
*  He raped people. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2128.44s)]
*  And, well, OK, who were they? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2129.2000000000003s)]
*  It was like, no, I work there. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2131.32s)]
*  I know everybody. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2132.56s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2133.84s)]
*  Just trust me. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  If you saw what we saw, you know, I was like, OK, but can you just tell me, like, what were [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2136.52s)]
*  the circumstances of the rape? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2140.76s)]
*  This is like an elderly man who's got hemophilia. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2141.96s)]
*  Don't think he's raping anybody. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2143.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, and they were very annoyed that I asked the basic questions. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2145.04s)]
*  And look, I don't know so many things I don't know, but I did come out of that meeting [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2148.68s)]
*  thinking he didn't rape anybody. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2152.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2154.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2154.68s)]
*  I see it all the time where they people get accused of things, then they get overwhelmed [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2155.2s)]
*  by media and then they're overwhelmed. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2158.16s)]
*  And people always say the same thing. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  We know this. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2160.72s)]
*  We know that. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2161.44s)]
*  Look, I've talked to people. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2161.8799999999997s)]
*  We know this. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2162.56s)]
*  Look, look, let's just start there. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2163.12s)]
*  We know that Karl Rove did that to me. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  He went to people and said, we know this, we know this, we know this. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2165.72s)]
*  And they're like, well, where's the proof? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2168.04s)]
*  I've got it somewhere. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what he does. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2173.3199999999997s)]
*  But I do think you just all you need is self-respect. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2173.92s)]
*  Like I'm not going to be lied to if I can help it. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2176.76s)]
*  I'm lied to all the time and I don't know it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2178.52s)]
*  But if but I'm not going to allow myself to be lied to if I can help it. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2180.6s)]
*  Well, but people are just like, they're willing to be lied to. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2184.88s)]
*  It's the vaccine safe and effective. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2188.44s)]
*  OK, then it turns out it's not safe and effective. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2189.92s)]
*  And then they don't have enough self-respect to demand an accounting of those lies. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2192.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you told me this turned out not to be true. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2197.16s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2198.52s)]
*  No one ever does that. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2199.56s)]
*  Or they Carl Rove shows up and is like, we know Ken Paxson is a criminal. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2200.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2204.44s)]
*  Where's everyone's self-respect? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2206.2s)]
*  Like I'm an adult man. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2207.84s)]
*  You can't lie to me. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2208.8s)]
*  OK, that just seems like a kind of baseline. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2210.72s)]
*  It is a baseline. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2214.0s)]
*  And that's why when I was in the middle of that impeachment and I had no voice, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2214.8s)]
*  I could not respond. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2217.64s)]
*  I'm getting beaten up every day. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2218.52s)]
*  Tell my lawyers, I know you, I know you think I'm going to resign. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2220.52s)]
*  But I haven't told no one I'm going to resign because I'm not even [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2224.32s)]
*  allowed to talk to the media. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2225.96s)]
*  So how could I even tell them because they were printing stories. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2227.32s)]
*  I'm going to resign. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2229.2s)]
*  I said, I want you to know, I don't care how bad it gets. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2230.36s)]
*  I don't care what they say. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2232.6000000000004s)]
*  These senators are going to I'm going to make them vote. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2233.96s)]
*  They're going to I got elected four and a half months ago by the people. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2236.96s)]
*  Let them vote me out. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2239.6800000000003s)]
*  If they do, they will be accountable to those. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2240.88s)]
*  But I will not give in no matter what. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2243.1200000000003s)]
*  I watched it up close and you won. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2246.96s)]
*  It was it was amazing. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2250.28s)]
*  It was it was hard. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2252.04s)]
*  So how many times did you win at the Supreme Court with the [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2253.96s)]
*  pre the Biden administration? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2256.92s)]
*  How many times? Yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2258.28s)]
*  Gosh, I mean, we had 106 cases. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2259.8s)]
*  We won over 75 percent of our cases, but several of them that we [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2262.5600000000004s)]
*  I can't even keep track of. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2266.48s)]
*  But 106. A lot. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2267.76s)]
*  We went there a lot. You shoot them on her six. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2269.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm so I'm kind of thinking since this is politics, that that may have had [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2271.04s)]
*  a role in your impeachment. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2274.88s)]
*  I have no doubt. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2276.0s)]
*  You know, I know they were there. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2277.36s)]
*  I'm convinced that by administration, went to the House, Texas House, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2279.44s)]
*  with the Democrats that we want him to be and then Biden sent two lawyers [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2282.84s)]
*  from the Department of Justice to help the General Investigating Committee, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2287.24s)]
*  which is five member committee, three Republicans, two Democrats. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2289.8799999999997s)]
*  They had four lawyers. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2292.56s)]
*  Two of them came from the Justice Department, just randomly showed up to help. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2293.3999999999996s)]
*  Was the Biden administration involved? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2299.08s)]
*  I don't have proof, but I'm not. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2301.08s)]
*  I'm not stupid. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2303.2s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2305.12s)]
*  So is there any to do you expect that Karl Rove will be involved in this primary? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2306.2s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. He he will do whatever he can to stop. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  He does whatever he can to stop conservatives in Texas in general. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2313.24s)]
*  Most of it's in Texas. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2316.28s)]
*  All of his fundraising, everything he's out to help Republicans. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2317.6000000000004s)]
*  He goes into primaries to get Republicans to take out conservatives. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2320.6400000000003s)]
*  I know he is not there raising money to go after Democrats. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2323.76s)]
*  He's there to go after Republicans. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2326.48s)]
*  What do you think he's doing? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2327.84s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing the number of Republicans who are Republicans [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2329.76s)]
*  who are mobilizing against Trump's nominees, particularly Bobby Kennedy [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2333.6800000000003s)]
*  and Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  He must be having I don't know this, but do you think Karl has a hand in any of that? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  I would not surprise me at all. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2345.12s)]
*  Wouldn't surprise me. Not at all. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2346.48s)]
*  And the reason they want to go after those two is because they're got they're effective. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2348.0s)]
*  Oh, they're courageous. Of course. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2351.88s)]
*  And they're going to change America if they're given the opportunity. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2353.88s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2356.3199999999997s)]
*  And they're so sad to see some Republicans who I know well mobilizing against Bobby [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2357.16s)]
*  Kennedy and they're saying we're doing because he's pro choice. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2364.2s)]
*  And well, I'm vehemently passionately pro life. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2366.44s)]
*  I have always been. I will always be. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2369.7999999999997s)]
*  But these are all people who are themselves pro choice, supported plenty of pro choice [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2372.0s)]
*  nominees. And it's not about that. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2377.4s)]
*  It's about the fear that Bobby Kennedy means it, that he's sincere and that he'll get [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2380.08s)]
*  something done. And by getting done, it's like fighting the corruption that controls Washington. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2385.52s)]
*  The thing that's most missing in political leadership is not knowledge of what to do or how to do it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2389.16s)]
*  It's courage. And the thing that Bobby Kennedy has, he will take on the Democrats, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2395.52s)]
*  his own family and the food, the big food. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2401.56s)]
*  That's exactly right. And they know that. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2405.64s)]
*  And that's what they're afraid of. So they have to stop them. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2407.72s)]
*  Yeah. It's the testosterone level that scares them. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2409.92s)]
*  That's totally absolutely right. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2412.4s)]
*  Unafraid. He's unafraid. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2413.96s)]
*  So in September, we went across the country, coast to coast, 17 different cities on a nationwide live tour. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2415.28s)]
*  And it was amazing. We brought the entire staff with us, like we always do, because we all work together for so long [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2421.2s)]
*  and enjoy traveling together. And one of our producers is a documentary filmmaker. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2427.28s)]
*  And so he decided to make a documentary film about our trip a full month across America [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2431.6800000000003s)]
*  with some of the most interesting people around. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2436.88s)]
*  Different people join us every single night on Gino and Russell Brand and Bobby Kennedy and J.D. Vance and Donald Trump, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2439.48s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera, with the best time. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2445.48s)]
*  And the fruit of that is a documentary called On the Road, the Tucker Carlson Live Tour, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2447.48s)]
*  which is available right now on TCN. On the Road, Tucker Carlson Live Tour is hilarious. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2452.8s)]
*  You will like it. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2459.0800000000004s)]
*  It's interesting. Do you think it's fair to keep a list? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2464.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I'm probably too fixated on this because I lived in a Republican world in Washington for so long, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2467.92s)]
*  but I think it's fair to keep a list of like the Republicans who are working against reform, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2471.76s)]
*  who are working against Trump's best decisions, which are reform minded decisions like nominating Bobby and Tulsi. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2478.6s)]
*  Like we should keep a list of that. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2485.92s)]
*  Absolutely. And it should be open. We should be transparent. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2487.12s)]
*  We should tell the world like who's working against us because they've done all this and they try to do this in secret. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2489.0s)]
*  And then they go back and tell their constituents, well, yeah, I did my best. No, they did not do their best. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2494.12s)]
*  They were behind the scenes. This is John Cornyn's career. This is what these people do. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2497.92s)]
*  Transparency, just like my impeachment, the transparency of a trial actually helped me [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2502.56s)]
*  because the truth comes out. Transparency is what we need in government and we don't get it with people like the people you're talking about. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2507.36s)]
*  I think that's really deep and true. The thing they hate most is exposure. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2515.28s)]
*  I've always thought that's why they hated Trump there, where he was going to declassify stuff or say secrets out loud that, you know, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2520.6800000000003s)]
*  that implicate the people running things. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2526.6800000000003s)]
*  They hate him for that. And they hate him because he also is courageous and he doesn't. His agenda is the American people. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2529.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that's interesting. So do you think you may run against Cornyn? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2534.56s)]
*  I'm strongly considering it. I haven't made a decision. I have this spring to kind of work it out. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2539.72s)]
*  And, you know, I'm still doing my job. I had a lot to do under Biden before he left. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2543.96s)]
*  It's a lot easier with Trump because we're working cooperatively instead of having to be adversarial and everything. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2548.64s)]
*  So, you know, I'll be looking at this spring and seeing what people see. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2554.08s)]
*  I'm going to travel the state and get a get a feel for it. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2557.44s)]
*  But my sense already is that John Cornyn is not loved in my state by Republicans. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2559.52s)]
*  He may be loved by the Democrats, but he is not loved by the Republicans. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2564.92s)]
*  How long do you think Texas has before it becomes a Democratic state? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2569.16s)]
*  It's totally up to us. We can preserve it. We can just like with this thing I told you about America, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2573.52s)]
*  if we do the right things and we take care of the people in our state and we give them opportunity, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2579.04s)]
*  we give them a good education, which the state is responsible for. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2584.96s)]
*  If we provide opportunities for their children, if we provide just freedom to go be the best you can be [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2588.44s)]
*  and not get in their way with regulations and taxes, we give them we will be a Republican state [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2595.32s)]
*  because what it doesn't matter what your skin color is, if you get a chance to be successful, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2600.92s)]
*  you're going to vote the people that gave it to you. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2605.68s)]
*  I think that's right. I think that's right. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2607.0s)]
*  And I and I'm embarrassed to say that I kind of bought, I guess, intuitively. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2608.88s)]
*  I don't really think about it, but the idea that demographics is destiny. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2614.28s)]
*  And I do think that there's a lot of truth in that. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2618.52s)]
*  However, you know, Texas went from a majority white state to really a majority Hispanic state. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2621.0s)]
*  And but that doesn't mean that it has to be like a dystopian left wing state at all. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2627.2000000000003s)]
*  The Hispanics are conservative socially. They are hardworking. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2631.6000000000004s)]
*  They are family people and they want to be and they want to be successful, too. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2636.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, but it's interesting. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2640.76s)]
*  So that I first heard that line from Karl Rove, actually, how surprising, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2641.6000000000004s)]
*  your neighbor. And he would always say, you know, Hispanics are natural conservatives. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2646.5600000000004s)]
*  And I would say, well, I'm from California. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2651.5200000000004s)]
*  And that became majority Hispanic state. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2653.36s)]
*  And it just it just went right off the cliff. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2655.2400000000002s)]
*  It became, you know, really, really dark socialist dystopian place. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2657.32s)]
*  And he and I would say, so what do you make of that? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2663.2400000000002s)]
*  What I didn't realize was it was actually the liberal whites who are the problem. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2666.08s)]
*  I mean, that state's run by Gavin Newsom. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2672.2000000000003s)]
*  He's not from Oaxaca. You know what I mean? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2674.12s)]
*  He's from Martin County. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2676.48s)]
*  And and a lot of the decisions are made by people like that. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2678.0s)]
*  And actually, Hispanics are conservative. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2681.16s)]
*  I mean, that's real. Look at El Salvador. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2685.08s)]
*  And so it what what's happened, though, is that the party is controlled [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2687.56s)]
*  by neoliberals like Gavin Newsom, like Karl Rove. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2694.0s)]
*  And they use the power of the Hispanic vote to effect outcomes that [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2698.4s)]
*  I think a lot of Hispanic voters reject. Right. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2703.6s)]
*  Yeah. And look, Trump is winning counties in Texas that have never been won before. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2705.72s)]
*  And we are we're we are having more and more Democrat [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2710.0s)]
*  Hispanic politicians move to our party. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2713.7599999999998s)]
*  And their positions are not changing. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2715.68s)]
*  They're just realizing that the Democratic Party, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2718.32s)]
*  allowing all this illegal immigration and hurting their areas [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2720.88s)]
*  and all those types of things, they don't want that. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2724.28s)]
*  They they're leaving the machine. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2727.08s)]
*  I guess the only thing I would say just as an outside observer is [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2728.84s)]
*  if the drug cartels are allowed to control the machinery of democracy in Texas, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2733.2000000000003s)]
*  like it could become Mexico. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2738.36s)]
*  That's why the whole thing that I was telling you about is so important. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2740.04s)]
*  I remember when I was coming into the attorney general's office, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2743.08s)]
*  Abbott served as long as serving AG in Texas for 12 years. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2745.32s)]
*  Coming governor. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2748.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm now about to tie that. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2749.76s)]
*  But it was he was the one that told me [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2751.48s)]
*  the most powerful elected officials in the country, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2754.84s)]
*  Texas district attorneys, because they can do whatever they want. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2759.0s)]
*  They can allow any crime they want. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2761.7200000000003s)]
*  They can let their friends commit crimes. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2763.12s)]
*  And there's nothing that can be done to them. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2764.84s)]
*  They are free to do what they want. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2766.4s)]
*  So we had problems like this in in the fifties and sixties after Brown versus Board, where [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2768.08s)]
*  certain states just didn't want to comply with federal law. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2775.2000000000003s)]
*  There was and, you know, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2777.48s)]
*  and said, I'm sorry, you can't violate federal law. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2782.92s)]
*  You can't. You're not your own country, actually. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2785.16s)]
*  And and you wonder, like, how serious could the Trump DOJ be in reigning in this crap? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2787.92s)]
*  No, you're not allowed to have chaos in your state. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2793.48s)]
*  This is an American state. No. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2796.08s)]
*  I agree with that. And I think you're already seeing it on the board. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2798.04s)]
*  He's already sent federal troops down there. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2801.12s)]
*  And I think he as long as it's following federal law, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2802.8s)]
*  I know that Trump is going to be aggressive at protecting this country. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2806.08s)]
*  I hope so. And I believe it. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2810.2s)]
*  So here's a question I've been obsessed with recently. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2813.0s)]
*  I don't know the answer, but you're an attorney general. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2815.04s)]
*  How are states allowed to have sanctuary cities and open violation of federal law? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2817.4s)]
*  And that's not insurrection because we've allowed it to me that that should. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2821.68s)]
*  I mean, like in our state, we banned them. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2825.16s)]
*  You cannot have a sanctuary city and we can remove people from office [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2826.68s)]
*  that that put that in place. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2830.92s)]
*  But can states just say we're going to ignore federal law? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2832.96s)]
*  I think we had a civil war over that, didn't we? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2835.36s)]
*  No, as long as the federal law is constitutional and it is not infringing upon states rights. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2837.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. You know, every federal law is correct. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2842.08s)]
*  Right. But the ones that are that that are correct, then yes, they have to be followed. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2844.44s)]
*  We're we're you know, these are the borders of the nation. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. Right. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2852.84s)]
*  So what states do with immigration affects the other 49, any individual state. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2853.6800000000003s)]
*  Exactly right. Because it does seem like there was a standard in place under Biden [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2859.2400000000002s)]
*  where illegal aliens who are by their president's committee of crime [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2864.52s)]
*  were held to a lower standard than American citizens. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2868.48s)]
*  We had to sue the Biden administration. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2871.7599999999998s)]
*  We sue them specifically over letting criminals into this country, known criminals. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2873.52s)]
*  And they fought us on it. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2877.88s)]
*  They fought us on a very yes, we are in litigation over [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2879.52s)]
*  whether the Biden administration can purposely bring criminals. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2883.6s)]
*  And of course, all these countries were emptying their prisons [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2886.72s)]
*  to get rid of their bad people from all over the world. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2889.6s)]
*  And Biden say, come on in. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2891.72s)]
*  It's it's that's what I say. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2894.0s)]
*  Evil. Like I don't believe they were trying to do good for America. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2895.52s)]
*  You cannot do that and tell me you are trying to help America. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2898.12s)]
*  How hopeful are you that we can deport millions of people? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2904.6s)]
*  Look, I've seen Donald Trump do things that I never thought could be done. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2910.04s)]
*  He said he's going to do it. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2913.12s)]
*  I think it's you're not going to get every one of them. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2914.84s)]
*  But I think Tom Holman, I love that guy. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2917.68s)]
*  He I think there's going to be a real serious effort to get as many out as possible. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2919.96s)]
*  And that's really all you can do. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2924.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think it's I think it will be a success in the end, because they're going to [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2925.28s)]
*  one, stop the you got to stop the bleeding, right? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2929.16s)]
*  We've been bleeding profusely. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2931.44s)]
*  And then second, start moving. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2933.2s)]
*  Don't accept the fact that these people came in here illegally [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2934.88s)]
*  and just let them stay. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2938.32s)]
*  There will be a lot of forces arrayed to stop that. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2943.36s)]
*  Obviously. The I already know the Democratic AGs. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2947.44s)]
*  I mean, I know the game plan. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2952.04s)]
*  And I was the game plan. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2953.24s)]
*  The game plan is to sue Trump and stop him at every turn legally. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2954.88s)]
*  Go to a liberal judge, try to get an injunction and then, you know, slow, just slow it down. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2957.64s)]
*  So I know I think California AG already they've already allocated 25 million to this fight. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2963.24s)]
*  So I have to stop Trump from deporting criminals and to stop his agenda in every possible way. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2968.2799999999997s)]
*  So the Democratic attorney generals are going to be suing and trying to stop all of this. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2973.52s)]
*  The good thing is, you know, I've got one of my guys was my offensive coordinator to sue the Biden administration. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2978.44s)]
*  He's he's if he gets confirmed, he'll be in a strategic position [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2983.88s)]
*  and he knows exactly the game plan and how to deal with it. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2987.7999999999997s)]
*  If you go and beat Cornyn in the Senate, which I certainly hope you will, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2990.96s)]
*  is there someone coming up behind you who can get elected, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2995.7999999999997s)]
*  who will be as aggressive and focused on the needs of Texas? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=2999.52s)]
*  So one of the reasons I didn't want to leave last time, one is I don't want to be forced out. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3002.4s)]
*  Like I didn't I didn't want them to I didn't want to step away under their terms because I just thought it was wrong. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3005.24s)]
*  That's so. The second was I didn't I mean, I ran against three people that I just thought would be horrible for for that job. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3010.16s)]
*  They didn't know what they were doing. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3016.52s)]
*  There are certainly people that will run that. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3017.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are there are lawyers who've never practiced law that want that job because they're in politics. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3020.08s)]
*  That's not the right way. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3023.6s)]
*  I want somebody who knows how to practice law, that understands the law. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3024.48s)]
*  And yes, there are a couple of people that I know that could run and I think might run. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3027.3999999999996s)]
*  Otherwise, I'd have a hard time walking away from it because I don't want to give this is such a crucial position [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3033.2s)]
*  really for the entire country. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3038.0s)]
*  The Texas Attorney General has the largest Republican office with the most resources and has the most ability to go fight. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3039.2799999999997s)]
*  We have we can attract talent. And so we have a lot of ability to take DOJ straight up. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3045.8399999999997s)]
*  That's why we've run up one over, you know, three fourths of our cases because we can fight them toe to toe. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3051.16s)]
*  I just think it's you see this weird dynamic in Texas [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3055.56s)]
*  where I mean, there's so many great people in Texas, but all the money, not all the money, but a lot of the money in, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3060.48s)]
*  you know, Highland Park and River Oaks, you know, your riches zip codes. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3067.8s)]
*  Pretty liberal. What is that? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3073.36s)]
*  And by the way, I know a lot of those people and I really like them. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3075.76s)]
*  I'm not attacking anybody personally because I know, you know, I know a lot of them. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3078.16s)]
*  But they seem to be funding people who will not continue Texas as currently organized. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3083.44s)]
*  It's exactly right. So a lot of it's very strange. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3092.12s)]
*  So this group, Texas for Lawsuit Reform, used to take a lot of that. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3095.4s)]
*  They funnel their money through them. So it wasn't them directly. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3098.6s)]
*  And that's the group that spent, you know, 10 million recruiting the Supreme Court justice, who is a DEI person, as it turns out. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3102.0s)]
*  That's how we we expose that. And she blew up. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3107.88s)]
*  That's who they supported. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3111.04s)]
*  I don't totally understand it, but it's like they don't like you, too. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3113.56s)]
*  They're like, oh, no, Paxton, so embarrassing. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3115.88s)]
*  I know it's because if you ask them to write a piece of paper, like, what are your political priorities? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3118.4s)]
*  They would they would be not so different from yours. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3122.6s)]
*  Is that whole? But they don't like it when you actually try to implement what you say you believe. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3124.88s)]
*  Here's part of what I think happened. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3129.04s)]
*  I think that I when I ran in San Branch, he was W is one of his best friends. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3130.36s)]
*  Of course, I knew Dan Branch. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3133.52s)]
*  He was not his deal was always this way. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3135.16s)]
*  I spent 10 years with him. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3138.04s)]
*  I would say, hey, we need to do this. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3139.68s)]
*  This is right thing to do. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3141.04s)]
*  He goes, man, what are the optics here? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3141.72s)]
*  I'm like, who the optics are? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3143.48s)]
*  This is the right thing to do. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3145.2s)]
*  It was always the optics. How does it look? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3146.16s)]
*  And his voting record, you can look at is not consistently what most voters, most Republican voters would want, but it was for Highland Park. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3148.2s)]
*  I don't know what is an affluent part of Dallas. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3157.32s)]
*  Yes. And same with you were talking about River Oaks in Houston. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3159.08s)]
*  Those that Bush world that supported Bush and I have family in both those places, and I think they're wonderful. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3163.08s)]
*  They're not. No, they're not. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3169.04s)]
*  I like all the people. And as I said, I like Dan Branch. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3169.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think I'm probably susceptible to charm in a way I shouldn't be because I like all those are all good guys. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3171.8s)]
*  But like they in the end, it's considered somehow gauche or bad to actually try and do what you say you're going to do. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3178.0s)]
*  That's why they don't like I've just no offense. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3186.32s)]
*  It doesn't hurt your feelings. But I've been at dinner and people like, oh, Ken Paxson, you know, Ken Paxson. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3188.48s)]
*  It's like, why? Because he's doing what you say you believe. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3193.16s)]
*  The same thing. What the hell? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3197.24s)]
*  It's the same thing with Trump. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3198.76s)]
*  People have I mean, I don't know. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3199.96s)]
*  You're right. It is. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3201.5200000000004s)]
*  I was at his announcement tomorrow. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3202.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, you elected officials were there to support him that first. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3203.84s)]
*  There were lots of regular people there. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3207.2000000000003s)]
*  Me and Troy Nels at the very first. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3209.0400000000004s)]
*  And now everybody then was like thinking it might be somebody else. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3211.4s)]
*  And no one wanted to touch it. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3214.5200000000004s)]
*  Weren't sure you got you had these indictments. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3215.28s)]
*  And it's the same thing with Trump. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3217.2000000000003s)]
*  If you actually go out and do the hard things, then you're controversial. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3219.5200000000004s)]
*  And then they attack you for being the media. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3222.48s)]
*  They don't like it. And then and then then people go, well, you know, we need to see. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3224.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, you're you're you know what? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3227.32s)]
*  You don't want Trump because he's controversial. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3229.7200000000003s)]
*  That means you don't want somebody to actually get something done. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3231.4s)]
*  The people that aren't controversial or the people don't get anything done. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3233.6800000000003s)]
*  The media doesn't attack them. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3236.44s)]
*  And so then all these people are like, oh, I just don't like his tweets, you know, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3238.04s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, what? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3240.88s)]
*  I care about what he gets done. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3242.36s)]
*  I think it may be that rich people are so insulated from the effects of everything [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3244.32s)]
*  that they don't really feel like these arguments are existential, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3249.7200000000003s)]
*  that they really, really matter. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3253.0800000000004s)]
*  Whereas, you know, if you make one hundred and twenty grand a year [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3254.96s)]
*  and you live in Houston and you see the city, like you can't use the hospitals [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3257.0s)]
*  and crimes out of control and like everything is changing too fast to metabolize [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3260.44s)]
*  and you can't really you make one hundred and twenty grand a year. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3264.64s)]
*  You can't really do anything about it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3266.2000000000003s)]
*  You are powerless. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3267.44s)]
*  And that's, by the way, twice what the average person makes. Yes. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3268.4s)]
*  You're like you realize this is not a joke. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3271.6s)]
*  They're wrecking my city for real. It can't be fixed. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3274.6s)]
*  I think you've hit it because those people, even those people, are affected [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3277.08s)]
*  by inflation, right? Everything is more expensive. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3279.92s)]
*  Gas is more expensive. It's totally right. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3281.8s)]
*  The average American and even above average American [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3283.32s)]
*  feels all of those negative effects every day. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3287.32s)]
*  If you're a billionaire, I just it's no, I know. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3290.5600000000004s)]
*  You don't care what it costs to fill up your gas can. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3294.32s)]
*  You don't even think about it. You could have. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3297.5600000000004s)]
*  It's just weird in Texas. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3298.88s)]
*  So if you go to California, if you go to Moran or downtown [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3299.84s)]
*  San Francisco or the town that I grew up in, affluent town, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3302.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, everyone's kind of openly liberal. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3307.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like they're smoking weed with their kids [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3310.0400000000004s)]
*  in there, whatever their liberal. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3312.24s)]
*  You go to Texas and you meet the. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3314.08s)]
*  Affluent class in Texas, boy, they're just great people. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3316.64s)]
*  They're just great people who share your values. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3320.16s)]
*  And and I think they really do, by the way, at least the ones I know, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  they sincerely do, but they don't feel that sense of [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3325.72s)]
*  of eminence of like, holy shit, we got it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3330.52s)]
*  This is like a crisis. They do not feel that. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3333.16s)]
*  Well, those are the people that elect me. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3335.4399999999996s)]
*  If you look at my campaign finance reports, I usually have [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3337.0s)]
*  a massive number of people giving, but a lot lower level than some [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3340.0s)]
*  of the other statewide officials. Yeah. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3343.6s)]
*  The numbers are just staggering. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3345.48s)]
*  I raise less money, but my contributions from the number of people I get, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3346.7999999999997s)]
*  I think I had the last report. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3351.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe I'm off on this. Maybe it's one for eight thousand contributors in six, six, six months. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3352.6s)]
*  Well, I don't think anybody comes close to that. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3356.64s)]
*  But it's it's it's not the million dollar checks. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3358.64s)]
*  I don't get million dollar checks. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3362.24s)]
*  I have a much lower contribution. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3363.3599999999997s)]
*  But I love it because I like the fact that the people [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3365.68s)]
*  as a group are helping me. Yes. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3369.68s)]
*  That's who I'm beholden to. Those people. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3372.48s)]
*  I think that's right. And there's a. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3374.3199999999997s)]
*  By the way, I just want to be clear, especially in Texas, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3377.48s)]
*  like the rich people I know in Texas are good people with nice, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3379.9199999999996s)]
*  love their families, their children turn out well, like they're good people for real. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3383.0s)]
*  I love them, actually. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3387.2s)]
*  But I and they would agree with everything you say. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3389.0s)]
*  But in practice, it freaks them out. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3393.24s)]
*  And you see this with Bobby Kennedy, too, like anyone who's kind of tuned in [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3395.7999999999997s)]
*  and realize, yeah, Bobby Kennedy is like a turbo liberal. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3398.84s)]
*  He's a Kennedy. Yeah. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3401.08s)]
*  You know, he said all this crazy gun grabby pro abortion nonsense. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3402.28s)]
*  But then you watch him and you're like, oh, no, that guy's on the same wavelength [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3405.36s)]
*  as me. And he might actually get stuff done. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3408.96s)]
*  It's only it's it honestly, it's the rich Republicans who he freaks out. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3411.52s)]
*  He scares them. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3416.44s)]
*  I see for the same reason you scare them, because you mean it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3417.96s)]
*  And they're like, oh, this is embarrassing. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3420.96s)]
*  Maybe I can't fully control it. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3423.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm for this. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3425.08s)]
*  Probably the problem is they all talk to each other [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3426.2000000000003s)]
*  and they all get their ideas from like each other. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3427.84s)]
*  It's just almost too inbred. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3429.88s)]
*  They don't get they don't get down to talk to the people that you're [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3431.92s)]
*  that you and I are talking about. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3434.48s)]
*  They don't know them. They are not around them. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3435.88s)]
*  They don't live with them. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3437.7200000000003s)]
*  So they don't feel it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3438.88s)]
*  It's part of what your original point was. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3440.0800000000004s)]
*  They just don't know these people. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3441.44s)]
*  If they knew those people, I think, like you said, they're not bad people. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3442.7200000000003s)]
*  I think if they connect with people that are not billionaires [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3446.6400000000003s)]
*  instead of just with each other, I think it's totally right. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3450.96s)]
*  It would help them. I think it's totally right. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3453.2000000000003s)]
*  I grew up in a rich person world. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3455.32s)]
*  The greatest gift I ever got was, you know, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3456.6400000000003s)]
*  spending time in a non-rich area for a portion of every year. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3459.4s)]
*  And it really changed my world view like so dramatically. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3463.28s)]
*  Just having contact with people who aren't, you know, in that world, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3467.2000000000003s)]
*  like just getting out of it a little bit. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3470.92s)]
*  It's called perspective. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3473.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't have a ton of perspective, but I have like a little bit of perspective. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3474.84s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3477.88s)]
*  So like that's super helpful. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3479.1200000000003s)]
*  It's super helpful. It is. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3480.88s)]
*  It's super helpful. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3482.2000000000003s)]
*  And, um, wow, that's so interesting. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3483.2799999999997s)]
*  Can you win if you don't have the support of the big money in Texas? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3485.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, all I can tell you is I've been I've been statewide for 12 years [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3490.4799999999996s)]
*  and I've won my closest primary runoff. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3493.9599999999996s)]
*  When there weren't, you know, four people in the race was 65, 35. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3497.7999999999997s)]
*  The last one was better, 68, 32. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3501.3199999999997s)]
*  So I just go to the people and I usually get outspent. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3503.2799999999997s)]
*  As long as I can be within like two to one spending, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3507.3999999999996s)]
*  I have a really good chance of winning a primary. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3510.4399999999996s)]
*  And I think anybody that whole is consistent on views that are [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3511.96s)]
*  that take care of their constituents. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3515.6s)]
*  That's the key to winning is take care of your people, care about them. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3518.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I've always thought that. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3522.56s)]
*  But then I up and down the ballot and state after state, you see people elected [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3524.04s)]
*  who are basically promising to destroy their own constituents. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3528.36s)]
*  And all the the black leaders in Chicago who are like, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3531.88s)]
*  you know, lecturing about black political power and how important it is. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3534.76s)]
*  And then they make this the city Hispanic. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3537.2400000000002s)]
*  Now they have no political power. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3539.76s)]
*  It's like, I mean, whatever you think of identity politics, I'm opposed to it. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3541.16s)]
*  I don't think you should be running on your race anyway. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3545.72s)]
*  But it's just a fact that they did exactly the opposite of what they promised [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3547.3599999999997s)]
*  their constituents. And really now nobody cares what those people think. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3550.7599999999998s)]
*  It's the same problem. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3554.12s)]
*  People like that were taking care of themselves. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3555.3199999999997s)]
*  They were not actually looking out for the people they said they were looking out for. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3557.7599999999998s)]
*  And then they they leave them in a terrible situation. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3560.68s)]
*  They're not better off. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3562.96s)]
*  What Donald Trump, supposedly the guy that doesn't like those people, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3563.68s)]
*  when he's finished these all categories of people, black, white, Hispanic, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3566.8799999999997s)]
*  are better off. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3571.36s)]
*  No, and that seems like a good thing, right? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3572.28s)]
*  I know. But yet he's a bad guy. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3573.8s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3577.12s)]
*  So here's a complicated issue that I think I know that you've addressed it in court. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3578.04s)]
*  Data privacy. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3582.44s)]
*  The idea that you ought to be allowed to have like conversations [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3585.32s)]
*  without other people listening to them, the idea that people [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3587.84s)]
*  should be able to steal information about you and profit from it. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3590.7200000000003s)]
*  Where are we on that? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3594.32s)]
*  So, you know, my first term was about stopping Obama. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3596.04s)]
*  Yeah. And so I think in two, two years that he was there, I sued him 27 times. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3600.12s)]
*  Now, I stepped it up a little bit with Biden, but we had four years with Trump. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3604.2s)]
*  And the reason I ran the second term was to deal with this exactly that issue. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3607.7200000000003s)]
*  I saw I saw big tech and I saw big corporations [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3610.88s)]
*  and people felt powerless because all their information is being taken. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3614.52s)]
*  They have no control over it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3618.0s)]
*  They're being censored. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3619.6s)]
*  And like, how do I solve this? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3620.96s)]
*  I went out to Palo Alto. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3622.0s)]
*  I spent like a year of my life going out there talking to professors, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3623.0s)]
*  talking to lawyers who were tech experts. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3626.16s)]
*  And we end up putting together many lawsuits, several against Google, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3628.84s)]
*  several against Facebook. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3632.04s)]
*  We just had like we sued Facebook because they there's a text law [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3632.76s)]
*  that says you cannot steal somebody's face, take somebody's face [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3636.32s)]
*  or their voice without their permission. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3639.36s)]
*  And then once you've taken it, you have a certain amount of time, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3641.6s)]
*  a reasonable period of time to keep it. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3644.08s)]
*  And then you have to destroy it. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3645.2400000000002s)]
*  And you can't sell it without their permission. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3645.92s)]
*  Well, guess what? Metta now Metta. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3647.32s)]
*  They were doing it. They just did it anyway. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3650.32s)]
*  Yeah, why do they care? So we sued them. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3652.84s)]
*  And we got the largest settlement between a state and a business ever. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3654.2400000000002s)]
*  One point four billion dollars. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3658.04s)]
*  We have sued Google, I think, five times. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3659.4s)]
*  We've won two of those cases. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3661.84s)]
*  We had two settlements, but the three biggest are coming. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3662.96s)]
*  One of them is is about the same thing that Metta did. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3665.16s)]
*  They stole our faces. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3668.0s)]
*  Another was about incognito, where they told people, by the way, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3668.96s)]
*  you go into this incognito, you sign up for this. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3672.12s)]
*  We will not track you. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3673.92s)]
*  Why? They tracked us anyway. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3675.2s)]
*  That's that's a deceptive trade practice in text, where they tell you one thing [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3676.64s)]
*  and do another. They lied. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3679.48s)]
*  And they're so big and they make so much money. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3681.12s)]
*  They just think they can win everything. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3682.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, the final one was [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3684.36s)]
*  this is one that everybody thought was crazy, but we did it. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3686.56s)]
*  And now then DOJ filed a copycat case under Biden, actually, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3688.96s)]
*  where they were. Google controls 97 percent of the ad market [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3692.7599999999998s)]
*  and they destroy the competition. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3696.64s)]
*  If you're competing and we believe they cut a deal with Facebook [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3698.12s)]
*  to keep them out of it, pay them off and they destroy you. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3701.0s)]
*  If you're small enough, they buy you if you're big enough [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3704.16s)]
*  and they cut a deal if you're super big. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3706.44s)]
*  And all of that's illegal under antitrust laws. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3708.44s)]
*  So we in April, we are going to trial in Texas. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3710.36s)]
*  They delayed me for two years by forcing me into what's called [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3712.88s)]
*  multidistrict litigation. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3716.0s)]
*  And I got put in New York. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3717.44s)]
*  But we get a piece of legislation stuck on a bill that got us back out of that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3719.12s)]
*  So we're back in Texas. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3722.4s)]
*  So we are going to take on the big tech companies. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3723.16s)]
*  We're taking on General Motors because General Motors would sell you a car [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3725.24s)]
*  and they wouldn't tell you that their on star system when you signed up for it [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3728.64s)]
*  was tracking all of your driving. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3731.6s)]
*  And then they're they're selling that to insurance companies. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3733.24s)]
*  And then you get canceled and your insurance goes up [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3735.48s)]
*  because they're tracking every, you know, every turn of your car, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3737.44s)]
*  what time you drive and how much they don't tell you. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3740.16s)]
*  That's that's a deceptive trade practice. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3742.04s)]
*  So and of course, we sued Pfizer. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3743.52s)]
*  And for for lying to us about the vaccine. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3745.8s)]
*  It was a little weird after all of that to see Larry Ellison [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3748.68s)]
*  stand up and be like, everyone's getting an mRNA vaccine for cancer. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3751.92s)]
*  What? I mean, it's crazy. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3756.96s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3759.16s)]
*  I'm trying to digest all that. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3760.76s)]
*  Maybe just living in Lenize, you know. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3762.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3764.08s)]
*  Do you have a hope? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3767.36s)]
*  It does seem like I'm not against. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3768.48s)]
*  That's why I am against technology, but I don't think I should be against technology. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3771.36s)]
*  I should be a little more open minded. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3774.6s)]
*  But, you know, there's a there's a place for technological progress. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3775.72s)]
*  Of course there is. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3780.2799999999997s)]
*  But it does seem like it's unrestrained. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3782.04s)]
*  It does. You know, I believe in force, counter force. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3784.12s)]
*  I believe in balance. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3786.68s)]
*  I believe in marriage, which is that, you know what I mean? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3787.56s)]
*  Two forces having to accommodate one another. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3790.7999999999997s)]
*  And in that you find peace. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3793.36s)]
*  I don't see that dynamic with tech right now. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3796.2s)]
*  It's just that just seems unrestrained. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3798.2799999999997s)]
*  The charge of the elephants like nothing can get in the way. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3800.4s)]
*  So that is the reason I saw I saw that if we didn't step in soon [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3802.8799999999997s)]
*  and I didn't see anybody else doing it, when DOJ wasn't doing it, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3806.72s)]
*  I didn't see other states do it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3810.0s)]
*  So it was my that's why I ran the second time. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3811.16s)]
*  My mission was we don't stop this now. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3812.7999999999997s)]
*  They make so much money. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3815.7599999999998s)]
*  They just buy their way out of everything. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3817.6s)]
*  So they get sued by the European Union. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3819.16s)]
*  They just pay two billion. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3821.6s)]
*  They just jack up their prices when you're making one hundred [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3822.6s)]
*  and thirty billion dollars a year. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3824.3199999999997s)]
*  That's just a minor little tax right for Google. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3825.4s)]
*  So that is why I didn't just I'm not just doing this for money. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3827.96s)]
*  I'm asking for restructuring of Google. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3831.44s)]
*  I don't want them to be able to do this to us anymore. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3833.6s)]
*  They need to divest things so that there is competition in the marketplace. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3836.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm not I am totally free market. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3839.44s)]
*  But one company that controls 97 percent of the market [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3841.52s)]
*  and then destroys competition, that is not good for consumers. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3844.16s)]
*  And that's why we have antitrust laws. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3847.84s)]
*  So if we don't stop them now, they'll control all our we still have antitrust laws. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3849.52s)]
*  We do. You'd never know it. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3854.64s)]
*  We've we brought them back. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3856.96s)]
*  And by the way, DOJ copied our Google case. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3858.7200000000003s)]
*  Exactly. Biden did. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3861.08s)]
*  Is there any hope? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3863.72s)]
*  There is hope. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3865.16s)]
*  And I think I think the fact that you see after we settled with Mark Zuckerberg, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3865.7999999999997s)]
*  he's he's shown up at Trump, so he was he spent, what, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3871.8399999999997s)]
*  four hundred million trying to beat Trump last time. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3874.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. You're seeing the CEOs come in now. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3876.36s)]
*  They're they're trying to keep their profit motive going. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3879.12s)]
*  And they're it's hard to get anything done in Congress because they give so much money. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3881.3199999999997s)]
*  But I think the state AG's and hopefully DOJ with PAM body [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3885.0s)]
*  are key to making sure that they play fair. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3890.2s)]
*  Look, go make billions. I don't care. I want you to go make a lot of billions. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3894.24s)]
*  I want American companies to do well all over the world. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3897.12s)]
*  But play fair and allow consumers choices. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3899.7999999999997s)]
*  Don't destroy choice. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3903.56s)]
*  Yeah. And it just acknowledged that what you do has an effect on a lot of other people. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3906.08s)]
*  And, you know, it's OK for other people to weigh in and have an opinion. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3910.2s)]
*  It's you get this. I mean, I know all these people. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3913.8799999999997s)]
*  You get the sense they're so annoyed. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3915.96s)]
*  There's any impediment to what they want. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3918.44s)]
*  Like, so annoyed, like they can't even believe it. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3920.52s)]
*  Like, what you're getting in the way of progress. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3922.28s)]
*  It's like, well, first of all, I'm not totally convinced this is progress. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3924.28s)]
*  Like, that's a subjective term. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3928.52s)]
*  We debate what that is. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3930.2400000000002s)]
*  But second, like, I don't know. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3932.08s)]
*  There are all kinds of things I want to do, but I have to negotiate [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3934.64s)]
*  with the people who are affected by those things to reach some accommodation. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3937.28s)]
*  That's just what life is. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3940.32s)]
*  But the idea and you see this with some countries, too, like, oh, you know, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3941.7200000000003s)]
*  our neighbors don't like a tough shit. It's like. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3944.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know. That's not what life is. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3947.28s)]
*  Like, everything is give and take is a give and take compromise. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3948.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, where do we get these attitudes? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3951.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, I just get to do exactly what I want. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3953.4s)]
*  It's going to totally overturn your life. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3955.52s)]
*  And if you don't like it, like, shut up. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3956.96s)]
*  These are super companies, right? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3959.0800000000004s)]
*  Companies are bigger than most countries. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3960.28s)]
*  They have more money. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3961.96s)]
*  And I think that arrogance that we talked about in politics, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3963.1200000000003s)]
*  it happens in business. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3965.48s)]
*  And so not only do they want to control every market [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3967.28s)]
*  and control every transaction on the Internet, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3970.0400000000004s)]
*  but they also want to tell you what to say and what you can say [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3972.84s)]
*  on their platforms. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3976.36s)]
*  And then they tell you they're not censored, but they are. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3977.56s)]
*  And so even with the fighter case where we we went in and sued them, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3979.4s)]
*  we sued them not just for lying about the effectiveness of the vaccine, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3982.7200000000003s)]
*  which they did do. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3986.6000000000004s)]
*  So you noticed. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3987.6000000000004s)]
*  But secondly, for trying to censor people once they found out [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3988.76s)]
*  that their vaccine didn't work. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3992.52s)]
*  I want to do that with this podcast. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3994.1600000000003s)]
*  So what I want is Congress to pass a law [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3996.0s)]
*  preventing anyone from suing me no matter what I do. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=3998.52s)]
*  Anyone who criticizes me is pulled off the Internet and called a racist. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4001.76s)]
*  That's a pretty good deal, don't you think? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4006.1600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4007.48s)]
*  And then if you happen to like not participate in their little scheme [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4008.32s)]
*  with the vaccine, then you lose your job and you're so. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4011.1600000000003s)]
*  Listen to my podcast or you're fired. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4014.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4015.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4017.32s)]
*  That does seem like an unfair business advantage. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4018.32s)]
*  It's pretty unfair. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4020.48s)]
*  And I actually it's crazy because then there's no incentive for them to test it. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4022.1600000000003s)]
*  They didn't test the vaccine. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4026.04s)]
*  They don't have to. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4027.6800000000003s)]
*  Why would they? They they test it for like six days. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4028.76s)]
*  Well, they're fully indemnified. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4031.2000000000003s)]
*  There's nothing you can do to them. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4032.56s)]
*  So we got actually sued Pfizer over the vaccine. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4033.92s)]
*  We got dismissed by a federal judge who said we didn't have [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4036.88s)]
*  because of that federal law. Our state laws don't apply. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4039.92s)]
*  I don't think that's right. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4042.0s)]
*  So we've appealed to the Fifth Circuit saying, wait a minute, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4042.7200000000003s)]
*  they have their federal laws, but our state law, if you deceive someone, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4044.96s)]
*  you lied to them, that is a violation of state law. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4047.7200000000003s)]
*  Who cares what the federal immunity thing is? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4050.2400000000002s)]
*  It has nothing to do with our state laws. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4052.28s)]
*  And that's our argument. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4054.16s)]
*  Man, you guys, you know, there's so there's so many arms [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4055.64s)]
*  available on the black market. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4058.36s)]
*  I think Texas should buy some just for one more influence. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4059.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4063.2000000000003s)]
*  That's not my department. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4064.1600000000003s)]
*  I always tell people they want me to go. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4065.48s)]
*  They want. Why don't you do something? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4066.7200000000003s)]
*  Why don't you do something more? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4068.0s)]
*  I said, well, I am, but they didn't give me any guns. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4068.96s)]
*  They just gave me like lawyers. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4070.8s)]
*  All I have is lawyers. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4072.6400000000003s)]
*  You like the drug cartels. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4073.4s)]
*  I am on the dark web. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4074.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, hilarious. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4076.1600000000003s)]
*  Kim Paxton, thank you so much for taking all this time. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4077.08s)]
*  Oh, I enjoyed it. Thanks for having me. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4079.1600000000003s)]
*  And I hope you crush that, John Cornyn. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4080.56s)]
*  I really do. I'm rooting for you. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4082.4s)]
*  Well, thank you. No one else agrees. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4084.2400000000002s)]
*  But I'm in Highland Park, but I'm on your side. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4085.48s)]
*  Hey, thank you. Appreciate it. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4087.56s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4093.12s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4096.4400000000005s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4098.0s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4098.84s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4100.52s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4102.4400000000005s)]
*  with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4106.04s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4109.04s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4112.04s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4113.400000000001s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4115.400000000001s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4116.8s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4118.32s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4119.76s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4120.92s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4121.96s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that is true, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4123.28s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4126.52s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4128.28s)]
*  we think it's to subscribe to our channel. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4129.92s)]
*  Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4131.84s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4134.84s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4137.2s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4139.4s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zPJGAQYMRY&t=4142.36s)]
