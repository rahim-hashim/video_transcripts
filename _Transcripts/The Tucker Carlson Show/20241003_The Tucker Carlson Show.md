# Medical Ethicist Charlie Camosy Debunks Media Lies About Abortion and Kamala’s Love for Infanticide
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec)
*  We're proud to announce live today, episodes one and two of Art of the Surge that are available [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=0.0s)]
*  to watch on Tucker Carlson dot com. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now they're the first of a multi-part documentary series. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=8.08s)]
*  We're going to release episodes weekly on Wednesdays leading up to the election. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=11.28s)]
*  We've had someone in bed with the Trump campaign. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=15.56s)]
*  Amazing footage. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=17.92s)]
*  Art of the Surge available right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=19.32s)]
*  Episodes one and two. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=21.52s)]
*  Okay, so let me ask you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=30.0s)]
*  The Trump campaign has, and Donald Trump himself at the presidential debate, has accused Kamala [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=50.64s)]
*  Harris and Tim Walz of supporting infanticide, which is to say laws that allow doctors to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=58.4s)]
*  kill children post viability and allow them to stand by as babies born in botched abortions [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=67.24s)]
*  die. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=74.28s)]
*  And the media in the Democratic Party, same thing, have pushed back ferociously on this [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=75.78s)]
*  fact checked it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=81.44s)]
*  You know, you're a medical ethicist. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=84.44s)]
*  It's absolutely true. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=86.6s)]
*  And until this whole political thing got in the way, everyone knew it was true. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=91.52s)]
*  I was doing my dissertation at Notre Dame on neonatal bioethics and I rounded with neonatal [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=97.28s)]
*  teams in hospitals in the United States and Europe. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=104.8s)]
*  And everyone knew that not only in the abortion context you're discussing, but in many other [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  kinds of contexts, we would just simply choose not to treat certain children, especially [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=114.36s)]
*  if they were too disabled. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=119.6s)]
*  And we would call it comfort care. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=121.16s)]
*  We call it something else. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=122.36s)]
*  But everyone knew exactly what was happening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=123.44s)]
*  So it's not just the abortion case. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=126.42s)]
*  Far from it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=128.2s)]
*  It's just a matter of routine and it can use across the country and around the world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=129.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=133.32s)]
*  And this is longstanding. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=134.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=135.64s)]
*  I mean, for instance, you could do it in a way where you bypass the parents. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=136.64s)]
*  It's called slow coding or show coding where the medical team basically says, you know, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=141.04s)]
*  I'm not sure this baby is, or I think this baby is too disabled, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Or will have too hard a life. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  It's not in this baby's interest in living. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=154.56s)]
*  The couple wants to do everything. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=157.04s)]
*  The family wants to do everything. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=158.56s)]
*  We don't agree with it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=159.76s)]
*  And so it's a well-known practice actually to show code or slow code your way into getting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  the outcome you want. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=165.88s)]
*  That's without the families. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=167.32s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=169.04s)]
*  So hospitals kill people's kids without telling them? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's a little more complex than that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=175.0s)]
*  It's not what Trump, unfortunately, uses the phrase when he talks about it in a particular [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=177.84s)]
*  Trumpian way, execution, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=183.04s)]
*  It's not as if there's like a pillow put over their head or a sharp object is used or even [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  like a poison is administered. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=189.92s)]
*  It's more like throwing someone away or discarding them in a way that keeps them comfortable. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  So it's called comfort care. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=199.16s)]
*  The debate over the law in Minnesota that has prompted so much debate over this insists [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=202.14s)]
*  that the babies be given comfort care. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=208.0s)]
*  But that's actually hiding what's actually going on in these particular circumstances. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=210.92s)]
*  They're given comfort care because they're not given the typical care that others get. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=214.44s)]
*  What is comfort care? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  It's mostly a kind of palliative care or a sense of trying to keep someone from not feeling [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  pain or something like this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  Like giving them opioids? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=227.32s)]
*  Yeah, or keeping the temperature appropriate and that sort of thing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=228.48s)]
*  In fact, the former governor of Virginia was caught on tape essentially, or not caught [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=234.64s)]
*  on tape. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=238.88s)]
*  He gave a radio interview saying this happens all the time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=239.88s)]
*  The baby would be kept comfortable. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  And then he said, I'll tell you what would happen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=243.88s)]
*  The baby kept comfortable and then we'd make a decision together with the parents about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=245.72s)]
*  what exactly to do. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=248.64s)]
*  And he said this in his interview, very matter of factly. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  And he was right to do so because until recently, this was not a controversial thing or it's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=253.44s)]
*  a controversial thing, but it's not controversial that this goes on at all. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=257.04s)]
*  And you're saying it goes on. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=261.32s)]
*  I mean, there's so many questions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=263.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  One, I think I wasn't aware this happened with children. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, of course, with the elderly at the request of the patient very often, physicians [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  stop treatment, which strikes me as fine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=276.0s)]
*  I don't, you know, something that I would want. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=279.76s)]
*  Most people don't want extraordinary treatment, you know, at 90 or something. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=285.4s)]
*  But you're saying it's very common with children. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=290.76s)]
*  And then you're further saying that it happens without the parents' knowledge or consent. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=293.24s)]
*  That strikes me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=296.92s)]
*  How is that not a crime? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=297.92s)]
*  Well, it should be a crime. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=298.92s)]
*  But it's and to be clear, it doesn't happen very often, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=300.48s)]
*  That is not routine. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=303.4s)]
*  The slow coding or show coding. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=304.4s)]
*  Slow coding. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  Coding means death, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=307.84s)]
*  Well, coding is specifically coding somebody as a particular kind of patient. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=309.04s)]
*  So if it's full code, you do everything to save the child's life, right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=314.04s)]
*  But if it's a different kind of code, like, say, a DNR, right? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=318.56s)]
*  Or a different kind of code would be put in to say, no, we're not going to do anything [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=321.4s)]
*  to save the person, which is totally legitimate in many other contexts, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=324.56s)]
*  At the end of life, we might make a choice about how to live, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=328.44s)]
*  And say, I want to live the rest of my life in this very particular way. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=331.76s)]
*  So I'm going to have a... [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=334.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want chemo. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=336.36s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=337.6s)]
*  Slower show coding. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=339.52s)]
*  And I'm sorry to interrupt you, but just to be clear, as an ethicist, you're OK with that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=340.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=345.04s)]
*  As long as what we're saying is it's a choice about how to live, not a choice about dying, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=346.12s)]
*  So if I say I want to live the rest of my life without chemotherapy or without other aggressive treatments [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=351.52s)]
*  and to use the language of moral philosophy and moral theology and bioethics, I foresee [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=359.52s)]
*  but don't intend that death is going to be the likely result of this or death will be [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=364.72s)]
*  sped up as a result of this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=368.12s)]
*  Totally fine, totally legitimate. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=369.92s)]
*  Centuries we've been doing this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=371.56s)]
*  It's quite different, of course, to say either as a person yourself or as a medical team [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=373.2s)]
*  or as a surrogate for another person to say, let's not treat you so that you die, right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=378.68s)]
*  Like, we are aiming at your death. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=384.08s)]
*  We are trying to kill you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=386.16s)]
*  And the context of abortion reveals exactly what's going on here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=387.12s)]
*  So Tim Walton Company in Minnesota specifically rewrote laws in that state to say, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=392.04s)]
*  yeah, I know we have this Infant Born Alive Protection Act here, but we need to make it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=399.56s)]
*  available to medical teams and others when there's a botched abortion to give the baby [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=404.04s)]
*  only comfort care and let them die. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=409.52s)]
*  But we know that it's not foreseen but not intending death because there was an abortion attempt, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=411.52s)]
*  That was an attempt to kill. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=416.68s)]
*  And so the attempt to kill is transferred over into the newborn context. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=418.16s)]
*  And so we're just doing it by omission, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=422.48s)]
*  We call it comfort care again. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=424.52s)]
*  But let me give you another example of how this works. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=426.56s)]
*  Sometimes and very often, parents are encouraged to have abortions in these cases where they [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  choose not to, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=435.72s)]
*  They push back on the medical team. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=436.52s)]
*  Like if there's a Down syndrome diagnosis, for instance, prenatally, the medical teams, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=438.64s)]
*  this is well documented, will push them time and time again to have abortions. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=444.12s)]
*  Even very pro-life, very prenatal justice focused parents get bombarded by medical teams. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I've lived that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=455.64s)]
*  You've lived it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=456.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=457.48s)]
*  And yes, with a false diagnosis without even getting it on about me or my family. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=458.12s)]
*  But I know for a fact that what you're saying is true because I've seen it with my own eyes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=463.48s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=468.0s)]
*  And what sometimes happens, and this again reveals what's actually happening in the post-birth [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=469.0s)]
*  context, these teams will get so frustrated that they'll say, OK, we can't convince you [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=475.8s)]
*  to have an abortion. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=481.32s)]
*  There are still things we can do after birth, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=482.52s)]
*  So if you say there was this case I just saw recently of a child who was diagnosed prenatally [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=484.68s)]
*  with spina bifida and the medical team tried to get the mom to abort and was unable to do so. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=489.88s)]
*  And the OBGYN said, OK, we can still choose not to treat the child after birth. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=497.0s)]
*  We'll give the child comfort care after birth. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=504.92s)]
*  Now, you might be able to say in the abstract, well, what exactly is going on here? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=507.64s)]
*  Is it more like foreseen but not intending death? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=510.44s)]
*  But you know exactly what's going on here because the whole point- [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=513.4s)]
*  They're trying to kill the kid. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=515.8s)]
*  They're trying to kill the kid. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=516.68s)]
*  The child is too disabled. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=517.4s)]
*  We've decided. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=518.28s)]
*  But I mean, I have thought this for almost 30 years since I first saw it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=518.92s)]
*  But how can someone like that be allowed to be a doctor in our country if you're pushing [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=525.8s)]
*  a mother to kill her child? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=532.8399999999999s)]
*  Like, isn't that the opposite of your job? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=534.76s)]
*  You would think so. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=537.24s)]
*  We have a lot of good doctors who don't participate in these kinds of things. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=538.12s)]
*  Do we have a lot of them? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't believe you. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=543.4799999999999s)]
*  We have a large number who either feel neutral about this or who feel positive about it, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=544.28s)]
*  who are active in it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=552.68s)]
*  Let me just give you an example of how the thought process goes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=555.0s)]
*  I wrote an article about this for the public discourse called The Right to a Dead Baby? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  And the way that they sort of try to justify it, and I cite all the literature in this [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=564.52s)]
*  article justifying this claim. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=569.4s)]
*  The way they justify it is they say, well, you know, after a certain time, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=571.8s)]
*  we would never neglect a baby to death and call it comfort care because we've decided [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=576.28s)]
*  that there is a new person here that we're saving, actually, who's disabled. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=580.6s)]
*  But before that time, and it's for every medical team or every doctor, it'll vary. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=587.4s)]
*  They think of it more as stopping an individual who's disabled from coming into existence. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=593.96s)]
*  Now we're talking about newborn children here or neonatal children here. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=600.6s)]
*  And this is well documented. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=604.2s)]
*  Again, the article is in the public discourse, The Right to a Dead Baby? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=605.32s)]
*  And I cite all the research that shows that this is how this is thought of. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=609.7199999999999s)]
*  And what's so interesting about this, Tucker, is this is what's... [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  I think if we think about history, if we think about the pagan Greek and Roman culture that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=619.24s)]
*  existed before Christianity came on the scene, these are the kinds of judgments that were made [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=624.36s)]
*  before a Christian ethic came to dominate in our culture in the West. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  Because as you probably know, it was thought of as not a big deal at all in ancient Greece and Rome [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=633.96s)]
*  to simply discard children that were too disabled or were female. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=639.72s)]
*  Females were too expensive for many families and so they were just discarded. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=643.8s)]
*  And it's no surprise that as we have repaganized, as the Christian culture has retreated, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=648.28s)]
*  especially in medicine, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=657.16s)]
*  Secularized medicine is deeply, deeply problematic and dominant at the moment, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=658.92s)]
*  even in some contexts where you might not expect it to be. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=665.4s)]
*  It's no accident we're moving towards this practice. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=669.4s)]
*  It's a little weird if sex-selective abortion is defended by feminists, which I just find... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=672.04s)]
*  I mean, I don't take feminists very seriously, but even by their low standards, that seems [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=678.52s)]
*  hard to explain if your job is to defend women and fight against anyone who thinks of women [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=684.12s)]
*  as less valuable than men. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=690.04s)]
*  How can you not say anything when sex-selective abortion changes the demographic mix and say [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=692.4399999999999s)]
*  the biggest country in the world, China? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=698.04s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=699.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=700.52s)]
*  I mean, it's no accident that abortion is used as a tool of oppression for this in China and other [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=701.72s)]
*  places. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=709.72s)]
*  It's no accident that it was used this way in ancient Greece and Rome. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=711.0s)]
*  The disabled were also very much part of the group that would have been discarded. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=715.0s)]
*  And just to give you a sense of how ubiquitous it was before Christians came on the scene, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  there were systems in place where you would sometimes abandon your baby in specific areas, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=726.76s)]
*  and with the hope that maybe somehow they would not die from exposure or be eaten by [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=732.28s)]
*  animals or something, but maybe they'd be picked up by slavers or sold into prostitution [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=737.96s)]
*  or something like this. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=743.48s)]
*  Even the early church fathers said one reason you shouldn't visit a prostitute among the many [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  is it could be a kind of incest perhaps because so many people in this area would be exposed and then [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=748.76s)]
*  prostitutes. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=754.52s)]
*  You might have a family member there. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=755.1600000000001s)]
*  I got to tell you one other case that just shows it's terrible, but it shows how ubiquitous it was. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  We have an ancient papyrus letter from, I think it's the year 1 AD of a migrant worker named [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=763.8s)]
*  Hilarion, who is writing his pregnant wife, Alice, and he's in Alexandria doing migrant work. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=770.52s)]
*  And he's worried that because his buddies are going to go home, we don't know quite where home [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  is, but they're going to go home. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=783.0s)]
*  And he's worried that she might think that he's abandoned her because he's not going to go with [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=784.76s)]
*  them. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=788.76s)]
*  So he's writing her saying, dude, don't worry. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=788.92s)]
*  I'm going to send you the money as soon as I get it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=792.28s)]
*  I'm going to stay in Alexandria and try to make some more money. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=793.88s)]
*  By the way, if you're pregnant, oh, and then he says, take care of our loved ones. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=797.48s)]
*  They already have kids. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=801.16s)]
*  Take care of our little one. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=802.92s)]
*  And by the way, if you're pregnant, if it's a boy, keep it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=804.6s)]
*  If it's a girl, throw it out. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=806.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay, bye, essentially. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=809.0s)]
*  It's an amazing letter. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=811.16s)]
*  It reveals so much about the culture, including again, when you don't have a Christian ethic that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=812.6s)]
*  says all human beings are equal, right? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  When it doesn't matter how old you are, it doesn't matter how young you are, how disabled [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=818.8399999999999s)]
*  you are, how expensive you are, how quote unquote burdensome you are. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=822.2s)]
*  That vision of the good is not present in pre-Christian pagan Greece and Rome. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=826.36s)]
*  And increasingly, it's not present in our own repaganizing culture. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=830.2800000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't present in supposedly Christian Europe in the 30s and 40s. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=833.6400000000001s)]
*  And I just find it so interesting that we spend a lot of time 80 years later talking [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=839.08s)]
*  about the Nazis. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=842.84s)]
*  And obviously, the Nazis are bad. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=843.5600000000001s)]
*  Everyone agrees that very much, including me. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  But the one thing that we almost never mention is that before they started rounding up other [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=848.2s)]
*  populations, the Nazis killed hundreds of thousands, about 300,000 Germans in hospitals. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=852.52s)]
*  The disabled children, a lot of them had comfort care, but it was murder. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=860.44s)]
*  And we never talk about that for some reason. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=865.8s)]
*  And it's sort of weird to see the American medical establishment, which I think thinks [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=867.8s)]
*  of itself as anti-Nazi. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=871.16s)]
*  It's weird to see them embrace Nazi eugenics policy because that's exactly what they're [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=873.16s)]
*  doing, it sounds like. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=877.32s)]
*  At the early stages of life, yes. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=879.32s)]
*  I think it's no accident this is defended as kind of an extension of abortion, which [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=881.96s)]
*  is a sacred cow that apparently we find it very difficult to ask questions about, even [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=885.24s)]
*  just very basic critical questions about saving lives after birth. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=890.2s)]
*  There is a little more hope, I think, at the end of life. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=894.12s)]
*  The American Medical Association still says that physician-assisted suicide can't be [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=897.0s)]
*  consistent with any rational understanding of what healthcare is. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=904.3599999999999s)]
*  That's still explicitly said by them, though it's under fire every year. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=908.28s)]
*  And the beginning of medical ethics was actually the Nuremberg trials, the secular medical [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=913.56s)]
*  ethics was the Nuremberg trials, which called out a lot of these practices. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=918.3599999999999s)]
*  Then I'm aware of that and I'm grateful for the codification of the lessons of the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=923.4s)]
*  Second World War in our medical ethics. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=928.76s)]
*  And this is what you do for a living, but it's just kind of weird to see that same [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  medical establishment embrace Nazi medical ethics, which they have. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=935.08s)]
*  So does anyone say that? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=941.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as you know, the critique, you're a Nazi is so overused that it sort [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=943.88s)]
*  of loses its bite sometimes. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=950.44s)]
*  Well, if being a Nazi means anything, it means euthanizing children who aren't fit. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=953.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=956.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=957.08s)]
*  And that sort of mentality was only possible with the retreat of a Christian ethic in Nazi Germany. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=958.6s)]
*  And increasingly, as the retreat of the Christian ethic today takes place, we're finding it [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=966.84s)]
*  more and more difficult to marshal the resources to say why we shouldn't have very similar [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=970.6800000000001s)]
*  kinds of practices. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=976.36s)]
*  Canada is already almost a totally lost cause in this regard. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=977.88s)]
*  We've had it in the Netherlands and Belgium and Switzerland for some time. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=981.0s)]
*  Many US states have adopted this, unfortunately. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=985.0s)]
*  I do think it's interesting that some deep blue states out here on the East Coast have [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=987.8s)]
*  resisted in part because of the disability rights community. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=992.92s)]
*  You're talking about euthanasia. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=995.64s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=997.24s)]
*  So yeah, we're talking about euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=999.16s)]
*  In fact, I think both Maryland, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, all these states [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1002.76s)]
*  are just have resisted well-funded attempts to try to legalize physician-assisted suicide. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1014.84s)]
*  So who's funding the attempts to kill? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1020.2s)]
*  Who's paying for that? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1025.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have all the information about that, but the main activist group is a group called [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1026.8400000000001s)]
*  Compassion and Choices, formerly known, as you may know, as the Hemlock Society, the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1031.24s)]
*  charmingly named Hemlock Society. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1036.92s)]
*  You might imagine why the board got together and changed their name to Compassion and Choices. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1038.28s)]
*  But they've been successful. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1045.32s)]
*  They've been successful in California. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1047.08s)]
*  They've been successful in my home state of New Jersey, unfortunately. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1048.84s)]
*  Who are the donors to Compassion and Choices, to the pro-killing lobby? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1058.6s)]
*  I'll tell you, I don't know the answer to that. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  It's weird that they're not famous because if you're pushing the medical establishment [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1061.3999999999999s)]
*  and the state, inevitably the state, because the state really does control health care, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1068.9199999999998s)]
*  to murder people or convince them to quote kill themselves because they're like poor [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1072.84s)]
*  or unhappy, then you're a monster and you should be well known, I would think. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1077.8s)]
*  I can imagine donors not wanting to be publicly known. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1082.12s)]
*  So maybe this is just pure speculation. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1085.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe there's a place we can look this up. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1089.24s)]
*  It'd be good to know about these questions. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1090.6s)]
*  But what's interesting about this is that they are well funded and they have [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1092.84s)]
*  narratives that they can use their well funded resources to promote. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1098.5200000000002s)]
*  And one of those narratives is very sympathetic, a narrative. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1103.72s)]
*  Like how could anyone, we were just talking at breakfast, how can anyone see somebody [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1107.0s)]
*  at the end stage of their life in racking pain, losing control of their bodily functions? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1110.8400000000001s)]
*  That's almost where everyone goes, is the first example. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1117.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, because that's where really almost everyone goes in life. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1121.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, that is what having seen, we've all had a certain age seen people die who we love. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1126.36s)]
*  And that is what it looks like. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1131.0s)]
*  It's unbearably painful and ugly and sad. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1132.12s)]
*  It's the worst thing. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1136.52s)]
*  So that is a compelling argument. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1139.48s)]
*  It is. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1141.1599999999999s)]
*  What is not widely known, though, is that it's a misleading argument because Oregon, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1142.44s)]
*  for instance, has had legalized physician assisted killing since the 90s. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1148.36s)]
*  And never has physical pain ever made the top five reasons people in Oregon request [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1152.6000000000001s)]
*  physician assisted killing. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1158.6000000000001s)]
*  The number one reason is fear of a loss of autonomy. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1160.44s)]
*  Also in the top five is fear of being a burden on others. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1164.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1167.4s)]
*  You can understand why disability rights communities are some of the most effective and [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1169.0800000000002s)]
*  energetic resistors of these practices, because when they say things like loss of autonomy, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1172.68s)]
*  fear of enjoyable activities, which is another loss of enjoyable activities, fear of being a [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1178.76s)]
*  burden on others, disability rights communities say, that sounds a lot like us. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1182.28s)]
*  Are you telling us that we're sort of making this judgment that people like us maybe have [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1185.48s)]
*  the kind of lives that should be killed or not worth living anymore? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1190.52s)]
*  And I think that's actually interesting to think about why these blue states [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1194.12s)]
*  out here have been successful. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1199.32s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear, actually, that the arguments made by disability rights groups [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1200.6s)]
*  saying we matter just as much as anybody else have been so far persuasive. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1206.12s)]
*  It shows that the Christian ethic of fundamental human equality has not totally died. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1210.6799999999998s)]
*  Because again, these are populations without that Christian ethic that would otherwise [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  just simply be discarded. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1219.1599999999999s)]
*  Land of the free, home of the brave. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1220.84s)]
*  It is the land of the free because the people are brave. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1223.08s)]
*  But what if they stop being vigilant? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  Do you remember when Ed Snowden revealed that the US government, your government, was spying on you? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1229.0s)]
*  You were probably shocked and then angry. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1234.04s)]
*  But most people have forgotten the lesson. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1236.6799999999998s)]
*  And the lesson is, it's still ongoing. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1238.9199999999998s)]
*  And so they use digital products and services that are vulnerable. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  Their data is being vacuumed up by data brokers and then government agencies. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1245.08s)]
*  Their privacy doesn't exist. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1250.9199999999998s)]
*  You should care about your privacy because without privacy, there's no freedom. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1253.56s)]
*  And you can take back your privacy with a product called ExpressVPN. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1257.56s)]
*  ExpressVPN is an app that encrypts and reroutes everything you do on the internet, your connection, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1261.88s)]
*  through secure servers. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1267.8000000000002s)]
*  And that prevents internet service providers from being able to see, monitor, log, or sell [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1269.3200000000002s)]
*  the things you do online, including to the government. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1275.0800000000002s)]
*  When you use ExpressVPN, your internet provider cannot sell your data because they don't have it [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1278.6000000000001s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1282.52s)]
*  It's fast. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1284.1200000000001s)]
*  It's super easy to use. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1284.76s)]
*  It takes one click to give yourself that encrypted connection. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1286.04s)]
*  It's so easy that we use it. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1288.92s)]
*  So if you care about your privacy and your personal liberty, take one easy step and get [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1291.08s)]
*  ExpressVPN. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1295.6399999999999s)]
*  Right now you get an extra three months of privacy free when you go to expressvpn.com [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1296.9199999999998s)]
*  slash tucker. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1302.36s)]
*  That's express, E-X-P-R-E-S-S, vpn.com slash tucker and get an extra three months for free. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1303.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so mad at the Down syndrome people that it's hard to accept what you're saying, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1311.8799999999999s)]
*  but I know that it's true. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1316.6s)]
*  I don't understand why the Down syndrome groups haven't said something about the genocide [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1317.64s)]
*  of people with Down syndrome, and I think they should be ashamed of their cowardice. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1322.2800000000002s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that there aren't great disability rights groups. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1327.64s)]
*  Well, it's interesting to think about how can we do a better job on our end as pro-lifers [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1330.6000000000001s)]
*  to welcome, we need them at the fight at the beginning of life for prenatal justice and [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1337.16s)]
*  neonatal justice now. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1341.64s)]
*  Because again, it's not just abortion. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1343.16s)]
*  These babies who are neglected to death very often have disabilities and were targeted [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1345.72s)]
*  for abortion in the first place precisely because they had disabilities. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1350.44s)]
*  And so I think there seems to be some movement now post-Dobbs. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1353.64s)]
*  I was heartened by some of the language that JD Vance used in a recent debate with Governor [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1358.3600000000001s)]
*  Waltz, thinking about ways to expand the pro-life message in ways that would be focused on social [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1365.0s)]
*  support and broadening the message out in ways that are really helpful. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1370.84s)]
*  And I think if we continue on that track, we might be able to bring in some of the disability [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1374.52s)]
*  rights groups into the fight for prenatal justice. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1380.6799999999998s)]
*  Because you're just totally right that it's a mass slaughter. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1382.36s)]
*  I think that's the way we need to talk about it. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1387.24s)]
*  Well, how can you get up there and be like, I'm advocating for people with Down syndrome, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1388.4399999999998s)]
*  and I'm so grateful someone is, of course, and then ignore the fact that basically they've [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1392.1999999999998s)]
*  been eliminated by prenatal testing and then abortion. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1397.88s)]
*  They've been targeted for killing and it's succeeded. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1401.16s)]
*  And if you run, again, I'm just grinding an axe here, but I wrote about them 30 years [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1404.44s)]
*  ago. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1408.68s)]
*  I've never forgotten the arc. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1408.8400000000001s)]
*  Have you ever asked them that? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1412.92s)]
*  We get into, I've been in part of the pro-life movement for a very long time now. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1415.88s)]
*  My first real job was actually communications director for pro-life Wisconsin back in the day. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1419.48s)]
*  So I've been around the movement a long time and I've been aware of attempts to reach out, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1424.2s)]
*  especially at the beginning of life. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  Our relationships are really solid at the end of life, really solid. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1431.0s)]
*  At the beginning of life, we have this political stuff going on that makes it very difficult. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1434.28s)]
*  But again, I think we're at this moment perhaps where something is clearly shifting in the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1438.28s)]
*  pro-life movement, I think, along with our politics that would make it easier to welcome [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1443.96s)]
*  those folks in. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1448.76s)]
*  If I can tell you just one story to highlight why this has moved me so much too, it sounds [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1449.88s)]
*  like you have a lot of stories in your background. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1454.7600000000002s)]
*  I was giving a talk, a kind of post-mortem, after the 2016 election in Connecticut, I think. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1457.0s)]
*  I was on a panel discussion with that and I was talking about this very topic, abortion [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1466.1200000000001s)]
*  and the slaughter of disabled people via abortion. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1471.96s)]
*  After the talk, this gentleman in his 70s with a guy I later learned was his son in [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1477.16s)]
*  his 30s, clearly had Down syndrome, came up to me and he just thanked me, the older gentleman, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1485.72s)]
*  and said, you know, nobody ever talks about this. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1491.0800000000002s)]
*  As you pointed out, nobody ever talks about, thank you for bringing it up. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1492.92s)]
*  I lost my wife two years ago and all I have in my life now is my son. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1495.96s)]
*  He's the joy of my existence. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1500.6000000000001s)]
*  It's so hard to hear the kinds of things we hear about abortion and how it's used [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1503.5600000000002s)]
*  against people like him. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1508.76s)]
*  In the middle of us talking, this guy who's probably in his 30s just grabbed me and hugged [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1509.72s)]
*  me as hard as I've ever been hugged in my entire life. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1514.44s)]
*  Makes me emotional. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1516.2s)]
*  Because he feels it too. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1518.2s)]
*  He can't really articulate it as well, but he feels the surrounding culture. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1519.48s)]
*  Anytime you're around someone with Down syndrome, or at least I'll speak for myself, anytime [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1525.16s)]
*  I've been around someone with Down syndrome, the spirit coming off that person is really [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1529.0s)]
*  unlike any other person you meet. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1534.6s)]
*  I mean, that's just hard to imagine, you know, thinking that it's good to get rid of people [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1537.24s)]
*  like that. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1543.32s)]
*  I mean, there's just a kindness that it's impossible not to notice. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1543.8s)]
*  And there's data now to support this. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1549.0s)]
*  People with Down syndrome actually rate their lives happier than those of us who don't have [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1551.16s)]
*  Down syndrome. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1555.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1555.96s)]
*  I'm not surprised at all, having spent time around people. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1556.84s)]
*  I couldn't be less shocked by that. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1559.56s)]
*  And yet we have a regime of prenatal violence, which targets them in a way that's just reprehensible. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1562.12s)]
*  But I'm also, you know, in addition to feeling sorry for anyone who's targeted for genocide, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1569.48s)]
*  I also worry about the attitudes that make that possible and that make it mostly unnoticed. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1575.56s)]
*  And the core underlying attitude seems to be some people aren't worth anything. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1581.48s)]
*  They're just objects that can be discarded. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1586.92s)]
*  And I don't think that's a good attitude at all to have for our fellow human beings. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1589.08s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1593.64s)]
*  Well, throughout human history, we've seen this be the norm rather than the exception, right? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1596.68s)]
*  It was not great for disabled people at all before a Judeo-Christian ethic came on the scene in the [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1605.48s)]
*  West. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1610.68s)]
*  And with this idea that every single human being, in virtue of their being a member of the species [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1611.3200000000002s)]
*  Homo sapiens, right, a fellow human animal in a way of speaking, has exactly the same value because [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1620.8400000000001s)]
*  that human being bears the image and likeness of God in precisely the same way, regardless of age, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1627.0s)]
*  regardless of disability, regardless of burden, regardless of any accidental trait in their very [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1632.2s)]
*  nature and the very nature of who they are, the face of the image of God is present. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1638.52s)]
*  They have souls, we used to say. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1644.28s)]
*  Yeah, they have souls. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1645.96s)]
*  They have souls. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1646.92s)]
*  Before that, it was just a matter of course to consider human beings in this way. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1649.6399999999999s)]
*  After that, though we didn't always live out, as Martin Luther King said, the true medium of our [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1656.04s)]
*  creed. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1662.12s)]
*  But we were on this trajectory, right? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1663.6399999999999s)]
*  We were trying to better live out this principle of fundamental human equality as the declaration [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1665.8000000000002s)]
*  says, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all of us are created equal by God, right? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1671.8000000000002s)]
*  Try to live that out more consistently. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1676.0400000000002s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, and it's especially true in medicine, but I think it's true more broadly [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1678.6000000000001s)]
*  throughout the culture. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1683.72s)]
*  As we've become post-Christian, as we've repaganized, at least again within our sort of [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1685.8000000000002s)]
*  spheres of power, not necessarily with the broader people, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1692.1200000000001s)]
*  we've lost the ability to say that all human beings are equal. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1696.0400000000002s)]
*  We've lost the basis for saying that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1698.44s)]
*  We do affirm the view like equality is maybe one of the most overused buzzwords around, right? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1700.6000000000001s)]
*  But I think of it almost like cut flowers as an analogy. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1708.76s)]
*  You can cut the flower off of its roots and put it in water and it'll stay beautiful for a little [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1712.76s)]
*  while, right? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1718.44s)]
*  But everybody knows that once you cut the flower from its foundation, from its roots, it's dying. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1719.0s)]
*  It's going to die. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1724.44s)]
*  These ideas, these foundational ideas like fundamental human equality have their roots [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1726.44s)]
*  in Judeo-Christian ethics. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1731.48s)]
*  There's just absolutely no doubt about it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1732.8400000000001s)]
*  And we have cut these ideas away from their roots and we still talk about them, right? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1734.44s)]
*  We still even use them as important ideas. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1739.48s)]
*  But the issue is the idea is dying. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1743.24s)]
*  The idea of fundamental human equality is dying. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1746.28s)]
*  We're no longer on the trajectory of trying to live this idea out more consistently. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1748.2s)]
*  We are now in a very different trajectory. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1753.56s)]
*  People are losing their fundamental equality, right? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1756.36s)]
*  We are thinking less about how to do this and more about, well, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1758.76s)]
*  you know, is it really being human that matters at the end of the day? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1763.56s)]
*  Maybe it's about autonomy. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1766.6s)]
*  Maybe it's about rationality. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1769.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's about self-awareness. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1770.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe it's about IQ. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1772.76s)]
*  I've heard more and more people talking about IQ recently in ways that I find sort of disturbing, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1774.4399999999998s)]
*  especially given what you said about Nazi Germany. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1778.6s)]
*  And so once you move away from fundamental human equality, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1781.08s)]
*  you're left with these trait Xs, I call them. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1784.36s)]
*  And it's very clear that human beings don't have those in equal capacity, right? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1786.92s)]
*  Or some human beings don't appear to have them at all. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1790.52s)]
*  Right. I mean, it doesn't... [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1793.24s)]
*  I think it's really obvious that IQ determines more than any other factor, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1794.36s)]
*  your material success in life. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1799.08s)]
*  I don't think there's any question about that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1800.68s)]
*  And I also think it has a huge effect on your interactions with the criminal justice system. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1802.12s)]
*  I think it's a very important predictor of your life. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1807.0s)]
*  I don't think it has anything to do with your value. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1812.6s)]
*  So that is just my opinion. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1815.6399999999999s)]
*  In other words, I think IQ is super important. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1816.84s)]
*  We should talk about it. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1818.36s)]
*  Okay. But God doesn't care what your IQ is. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1819.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with whether or not you have a soul. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1822.84s)]
*  You have a soul because you're a human being. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1825.56s)]
*  Your soul is identical in value to mine. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1827.72s)]
*  You may have an IQ twice mine. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1830.76s)]
*  You may be three times as rich as me. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1832.6s)]
*  It doesn't matter how that matters. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1833.8799999999999s)]
*  But just to be clear about my view on this. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1835.8s)]
*  Yeah. And if it's all right with you, I'd just like to name some of the categories of human beings [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1837.64s)]
*  that are on their way. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1846.52s)]
*  As we've... [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1847.88s)]
*  If we think about the trajectory before of trying to live out this more consistently, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1848.52s)]
*  we're now moving in a very different direction where people are falling out of the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1852.6s)]
*  circle of protection for fundamental human equality. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1856.28s)]
*  And so we've already talked about prenatal human beings and neonatal human beings as [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1858.28s)]
*  classic examples of that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1862.04s)]
*  In fact, it's so interesting to think about the early church's response to ancient Greece [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1863.16s)]
*  and Rome's infanticide was found in the Didache, which is a first century, essentially catechism, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1868.44s)]
*  which gives us a really important insight into how they lived. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1874.76s)]
*  And they contrast the way of life with the way of death and say Christians need to lead [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1877.96s)]
*  the way of life. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1882.0400000000002s)]
*  And the way of life is explicitly focused on a couple of things. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1883.5600000000002s)]
*  One, don't do abortion and infanticide. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1887.72s)]
*  They were talked about together explicitly because that's how the ancient pagan Greeks [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1889.72s)]
*  and Romans thought about them. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1894.04s)]
*  When was this written? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1894.92s)]
*  First century. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1896.2s)]
*  I don't know exactly when in the first century, but first century. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1897.48s)]
*  So it's very, very old. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1900.6000000000001s)]
*  It's very, very old. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1902.04s)]
*  It's called the Didache. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1902.68s)]
*  You can find it online. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1903.72s)]
*  You could find... [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1904.84s)]
*  It's got to be one of the oldest Christian documents. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1905.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the oldest Christian documents. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1907.08s)]
*  It also interestingly contrasts the way of life with the way of death in a way that [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1910.76s)]
*  we should... [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1914.76s)]
*  That those who are the rich and unjust judges of the poor are part of the way of death. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1916.12s)]
*  And the way of life is explicitly focused on one of the central messages of Christ, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1921.08s)]
*  which is to see my face, he says, in the poor, right? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1926.12s)]
*  See my image in the poor. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1929.3999999999999s)]
*  But okay, so this goes all the way back to the very earliest parts of the church, right? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1932.68s)]
*  And now we're not just seeing this with regard to the populations that [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1938.04s)]
*  so perfectly mirror that, newborn children and prenatal human beings. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1943.0s)]
*  But now we're seeing it with people with catastrophic brain injuries. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1947.72s)]
*  So if I can just speak briefly about brain death. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1952.04s)]
*  Maybe not so briefly because we have a two-hour podcast here and it's somewhat complicated, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1957.48s)]
*  but I need to set it up a little bit. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1961.48s)]
*  So I do a lot of work on secular utilitarian philosophy and I'm actually friends with Peter [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1963.96s)]
*  Singer, who's a very well-known secular utilitarian philosopher. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1970.76s)]
*  We don't agree on many, many things, but I think he's wrong in really interesting ways. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1974.36s)]
*  And he's seen, and he's since the 70s, he's seen what it has meant to reject a Christian [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1978.44s)]
*  ethic of human life. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1985.4s)]
*  And he said very explicitly, if you're pro-choice for abortion, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1986.28s)]
*  you also need to be pro-choice for infanticide. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1989.4s)]
*  He's right about that, just to work the other way. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1991.48s)]
*  If we're protecting babies, we should protect prenatal babies as well. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1993.64s)]
*  But interestingly, he says it really wasn't abortion that was the first moment where we [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=1997.0s)]
*  decided to say it, being human doesn't matter. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2004.1999999999998s)]
*  It was brain death. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2006.1999999999998s)]
*  So around the time of the 60s and 70s, when a lot of stuff went down that involved cultural shifts, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2007.08s)]
*  there was a confluence of two inventions. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2017.4799999999998s)]
*  The first was the ventilator, so a machine that helps people breathe. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2021.3999999999999s)]
*  And the second was the transplantation of vital organs from one individual to another. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2025.96s)]
*  And once we got the capacity to transplant organs, as you might imagine, as we have today, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2034.28s)]
*  huge waiting lists developed for this resource. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2040.68s)]
*  And then the ventilator was invented, and suddenly we had people with catastrophic [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2047.3200000000002s)]
*  brain injuries on ventilators. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2050.2s)]
*  And something called the Ad Hoc, Harvard committee to determine death or brain death, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2052.68s)]
*  came up with a proposal. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2060.68s)]
*  They said, let's decide that all these individuals with catastrophic brain injuries on ventilators [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2061.7999999999997s)]
*  have something called brain death and are dead, and therefore we can take their organs [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2069.0s)]
*  and give them to others who need them. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2074.04s)]
*  And by the way, I'm not hating on organ donation. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2076.52s)]
*  I'm an organ donor myself. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2078.2s)]
*  I'm just trying to tell the story that both Peter Singer and I agree on actually was a [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2080.4399999999996s)]
*  major turning point in all of this. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2083.96s)]
*  So what the Dean of Harvard Medical School said at the time was, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  it sounds like you just are redefining death in order to get more organs. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2090.68s)]
*  We don't want to release a document that says that's what we're doing. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2093.7999999999997s)]
*  And so they changed the document. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2096.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's still, even with the edited document, it's very clear. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  And this is historically well known that this is what happened. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2102.68s)]
*  And so what Peter Singer and I and others who are aware of this history say is, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2105.48s)]
*  this is when we first said a living member of the species homo sapiens, a fellow human being, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2109.96s)]
*  did not count, was dead essentially. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2116.76s)]
*  They did not have the same moral status as others. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2118.44s)]
*  Because guess what, Tucker? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2121.2400000000002s)]
*  People in these so-called brain dead states can gestate children. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2123.32s)]
*  They can fight off infections. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2129.88s)]
*  If you cut into their body, they release adrenaline and their heart rate speeds up. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2132.68s)]
*  There was even this case of, oh, and by the way, the gestating children case [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2139.0s)]
*  often happens, unfortunately, in very tragic cases where a pregnant woman [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2143.0s)]
*  gets into a car accident or something, has a catastrophic brain injury. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2148.8399999999997s)]
*  And her body is herself, she's able to gestate a child despite being declared brain dead. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2151.3199999999997s)]
*  One of my favorite all-time headlines about this, it shows the confusion we have about this in the [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2157.56s)]
*  culture is from the AP. It said, brain dead woman gives birth, then dies. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2161.08s)]
*  So it's just like the full confusion on display in one very short headline. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2165.72s)]
*  But maybe you remember this case from a few years ago, Jehi McMath in California. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2171.24s)]
*  She was this African-American girl who had a surgery go really terrible for sleep apnea, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2175.96s)]
*  had a catastrophic brain injury, and the state of California declared her dead. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2181.7999999999997s)]
*  And her very Christian, also African-American parents said, she's not dead. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2186.44s)]
*  And the state of California said, and her medical team said, yes, she is. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2192.7599999999998s)]
*  And by the way, according to her family's lawyer, Jehi's family's lawyer, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2198.2s)]
*  the chief of pediatrics at, I think it was UC San Francisco Hospital, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2202.52s)]
*  pounded his fists on the table and said, she's dead, she's dead. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2206.44s)]
*  What is it you don't understand? She's dead. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2209.8799999999997s)]
*  And then a few days later, she got her first period. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2211.72s)]
*  And they managed to convince both the state of California and her medical team to essentially [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2218.12s)]
*  allow them to transfer to New Jersey, where I live, which happens to be the only state in the [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2224.8399999999997s)]
*  union that allows religious freedom for people like Jehi's family to say, I don't think this [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2229.16s)]
*  individual who just got her first period is dead, and I want to take care of my daughter. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2234.12s)]
*  The other states don't allow that? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2239.64s)]
*  They don't allow it. They don't allow it. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2241.0s)]
*  What does that mean, they don't allow it? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2243.0s)]
*  It would be as if from their, in my view, deeply misguided view, they would say, well, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2245.64s)]
*  you can't just say a corpse is alive, right? Like this is a dead individual, this is a corpse. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2255.8s)]
*  In fact, some of the medical ethics, the deans of medical ethics around the United States reacted [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2260.44s)]
*  to this case, the Jehi McMath case saying, this is a corpse. They're animating a corpse. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2265.72s)]
*  Who are these people? She's going to decompose, they said. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2270.6s)]
*  Why did it make them so mad? Why are they so, so many physicians, most physicians seem like they [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2273.56s)]
*  just love death. What is that? Yeah, I don't know exactly. I think, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2279.7999999999997s)]
*  because I want to talk about vegetating. I know, I know. And I wanted you, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2287.16s)]
*  but I just keep, five different times in the last half an hour, you've made reference to the views [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2290.92s)]
*  of doctors on these things. And each time I have the same question, which is, I would hope that [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2296.12s)]
*  the default desire for doctors would be to see people live. And yet I have seen it in my own [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2302.2s)]
*  life. Most doctors I know get off on death. They love death. That is just my observation. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2309.24s)]
*  Maybe you've got a different one, but what is that? I do think there's a strain within [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2314.7599999999998s)]
*  contemporary secularized medicine that is so ideological that if there's something [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2319.96s)]
*  that pushes back against their very secularized, whatever, I don't know what to call it, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2328.52s)]
*  whatever the opposite of pro-life is perspective. Well, pro-death, I think would be the opposite. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2334.28s)]
*  Is anathema, right? And so- But why? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2342.76s)]
*  Because they're, and this is, I want to speak with too broad a brush, but in many cases, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2346.52s)]
*  the ideology is far more important than their oath they took to protect and care for life. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2351.08s)]
*  But you would just think like, okay, so this girl, they think she's dead, but then she has her period, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2356.44s)]
*  she's clearly not dead. Why would you pound your fist on the table and demand that other people [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2360.7599999999998s)]
*  think she's dead? Or why would you push parents to abort a child with Down syndrome or spinal [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2366.04s)]
*  bifida, both of which are survivable and thrive, you can thrive with both of those things. So [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2370.92s)]
*  why are they so vested in, we must kill? Like they're not neutral on it. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2376.6800000000003s)]
*  That's right. Like what is that? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2380.6s)]
*  Well, I think there would be at least two sets of reasons in the case of brain death. The first one [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2383.32s)]
*  would be unique to brain death. The other one would connect with what's called vegetative state. I [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2390.36s)]
*  think maybe offensively vegetative state, which is different. I'm going to say more about that in a [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2393.64s)]
*  minute if that's all right. But with brain death, I think what's always in the background here is [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2397.24s)]
*  what the Harvard brain death committee was concerned with, organs. So if we suddenly say [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2401.0s)]
*  that individuals with catastrophic brain injuries are not dead, and we still have the dead donor [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2408.68s)]
*  rule that says you need to be dead in order to donate a non-paired vital organ, like a heart, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2413.72s)]
*  say, then the number of, then the waiting list for organs just goes way through the roof right now. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2417.72s)]
*  And this is actually brought up. There have been champions, secular champions of attempts to really [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2426.7599999999998s)]
*  call brain death or what it is a kind of fiction. Well, originally it was a fiction that was just [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2434.6s)]
*  designed to put us in a position to get better organs and more organs. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2440.44s)]
*  When he gives talks, he routinely gets questions like, you shouldn't be talking about this. You [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2447.56s)]
*  know what's going to be the result of what you're talking about here? People are going to die [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2454.04s)]
*  because they're not going to get organs that they need. They're going to die on organ waiting lists. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2457.48s)]
*  And so don't talk about this because people will die. Don't talk about vax injuries because [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2461.24s)]
*  vaccines are too important. It's a classic utilitarian perspective on these things. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2467.24s)]
*  But if you find yourself lying or ignoring harm to individuals on behalf of some imagined greater [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2473.96s)]
*  good, then you're just evil. I mean, I don't really see another plausible description of that. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2480.84s)]
*  If one has a view that what's at bottom true about ethics and morality is maximizing the [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2488.52s)]
*  greatest good for the greatest number, we can call it evil. I think in many cases it is, but that just, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2496.52s)]
*  this just follows logically. Why would we get bent out of shape about whether Jehi McMath is a person [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2502.2000000000003s)]
*  or not or has human dignity or not? What really matters at the end of the day is that we [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2507.0s)]
*  maximize good outcomes from this situation. Because that's a Nazi attitude. That's literally [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2511.32s)]
*  the attitude that they were not ashamed of. They bragged about, they wrote about it extensively. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2517.8s)]
*  We seem to have forgotten all of this. We remember all the lessons about Poland and Czechoslovakia. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2522.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, we missed the basic lesson, which is you cannot treat people like objects or else you end [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2527.0s)]
*  up committing genocide. It's like super simple. Right. Sorry. No, that's well said. I think another [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2532.76s)]
*  angle into it though is this a different kind of ideological angle, which is if we say that [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2540.6000000000004s)]
*  individuals who have catastrophic brain injuries but are clearly still functioning members of the [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2546.84s)]
*  species homo sapiens, just like you and I are, though very serially disabled, that has implications [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2553.8s)]
*  for human dignity that if applied consistently would undermine very foundational views, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2561.48s)]
*  including with regard to abortion. Right. And this is explicitly said. So [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2565.4s)]
*  let's talk if you don't mind about so-called vegetative state. Yeah. Okay. So if I could, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2570.2s)]
*  sorry, get so spun up, I keep interrupting you. I beg your pardon. No. You've said three times [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2574.92s)]
*  that brain death is a category that was kind of devised as really almost like a marketing tool [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2581.64s)]
*  in order to increase the supply of organs. But what is brain death exactly? When it's explained [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2588.84s)]
*  to laymen like me, it's their flatlining. We're doing, you know, we're measuring brain activity [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2596.28s)]
*  and there's none. Is that real? Yeah. So part of the problem here is there really isn't a good way [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2601.08s)]
*  to test for what's called whole brain death in part because, and this was actually after the Harvard [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2610.04s)]
*  report came out, something called the Uniform Commission, which is a nonprofit group that has [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2617.08s)]
*  surprisingly a lot of power to propose uniform language for states across the country without [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2622.44s)]
*  federal law to sort of make sure they're basically on the same page with regard to legislation. So [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2632.04s)]
*  there wouldn't be like one kind of brain death laws in California and a different kind in New [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2635.8s)]
*  York. And so I think it was 1981, certainly the early eighties, they proposed language that basically [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2641.16s)]
*  mirrored the recommendations of the Harvard Brain Death Commission, which said brain death, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2646.6s)]
*  which means death of the whole brain, including the brain stem is death. And that's fine. You [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2650.8399999999997s)]
*  could say that as a thing, but then we have to find ways to determine that. And there's- [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2659.24s)]
*  To measure to see if it's true? See if it's true. And most of the ways, especially to determine [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2663.7999999999997s)]
*  whether there's brain stem activity, like in the very center of the brain, it's just super, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2668.68s)]
*  super difficult. There's a big debate right now in my world about whether the hypothalamus, which [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2674.84s)]
*  controls a lot of different things, but is this sort of tiny organ or part of the inner part of [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2680.36s)]
*  the brain stem. There's all sorts of debates now about how precisely to test for whether the [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2685.0s)]
*  hypothalamus is still alive. And some people will say, well, who cares whether the hypothalamus is [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2690.1200000000003s)]
*  still alive? Other people will say, well, no, we got to determine whether the whole brain is that [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2694.52s)]
*  or not. And meanwhile, we got this individual, regardless of what's happening here, who's fighting [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2697.4s)]
*  off infections, maybe gestating a child, maybe reaching their first period. And so I don't- [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2701.08s)]
*  So anyway, to answer your question- None of what should be possible if the brain was dead. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2707.64s)]
*  Well, this is an interesting question. I think the push for organs, the connection to organs, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2711.64s)]
*  really pushed us through to determine that people were dead who had dead brains too quickly. I think [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2717.56s)]
*  we just sort of said, well, that sounds right, especially in the developed West, I think, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2724.84s)]
*  I think therefore I am sort of inspired world that's focused on the head. I wonder if we [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2729.32s)]
*  don't too quickly just assume that these things are controlled by our brain. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2736.1200000000003s)]
*  One of the interesting things I like to point out, or I think it's interesting, I hope you and [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2741.0s)]
*  your viewers think it's interesting, when the ancient Egyptians would mummify somebody, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2745.0s)]
*  do you know what they did with the brain? They threw it out. They thought it cooled the blood. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2750.2000000000003s)]
*  Now, what would a culture have to be thinking about themselves, right? To think that the brain [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2755.1600000000003s)]
*  is something you're really not going to need in the afterlife. It just cools the blood. It's sort [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2762.44s)]
*  of this thing that you won't really need, as opposed to us who really sort of imagine ourselves, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2765.48s)]
*  like I'm raised in this culture. I kind of imagine myself inside my head here. All these [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2770.28s)]
*  thought experiments in my world imagine, like, what if you had your brain in a vat on Mars, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2775.32s)]
*  right? Would that be you, right, in that vat? Like, if we could put it in a tub of nutrients [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2779.88s)]
*  and give it electric shocks. We talk about in this current transhumanism moment, what if we could [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2786.28s)]
*  do this modeling of your brain's information and upload it to the cloud and then download it into [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2793.56s)]
*  a robot or something? These are questions that transhumanists are really asking right now. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2799.32s)]
*  Very serious people are asking these questions, but I think it's because we sort of just imagine [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2804.2000000000003s)]
*  ourselves as this kind of creature that thinks of ourselves, well, maybe we just are our brains. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2808.28s)]
*  I want to push back on that. I want to say we are in souled bodies, right? We are our bodies and [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2815.2400000000002s)]
*  that we were who we were before we had our brains, right? Prenatally, we were who we were before we [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2821.6400000000003s)]
*  had brains. And there is some evidence, though it still needs to be explored, that especially young [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2826.0400000000004s)]
*  people, Tucker, can have other parts of their body take over for the functions of the brains [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2830.36s)]
*  in a kind of a really interesting plasticity of the body. I think some people have speculated. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2837.7999999999997s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2842.6s)]
*  So it's no accident that a lot of these cases, these so-called brain death cases, are children, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2844.6s)]
*  right? So there's been some speculation, some informed speculation that says, well, you know [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2852.68s)]
*  what? These children have the ability to have other parts of their bodies take over for their [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2857.7999999999997s)]
*  brains when their brains are destroyed, perhaps their spinal cord, perhaps some other way of [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2865.16s)]
*  thinking about this. The body, as you know, is an incredibly mysterious thing. And by the way, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2869.7999999999997s)]
*  we still have not found the place where consciousness exists in our brain. Maybe you've [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2875.48s)]
*  heard about this. For now, for decades, we've been exploring the brain. Where is the consciousness? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2879.8799999999997s)]
*  Where is the consciousness? Is it here? Is it in this part of the brain? Is it here? It's nowhere. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2884.6s)]
*  Nobody can find any seat of consciousness in the brain to the point where some philosophers [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2888.52s)]
*  of mine like Daniel Dennett have said, you know what? Maybe consciousness is an illusion because [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2893.3199999999997s)]
*  it must be in the brain. Consciousness must be part of the brain. And that is such a revealing [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2899.56s)]
*  claim because it's an absurd claim, right? It's an absurd claim. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2906.68s)]
*  Right. And that's also a non-scientific claim. I mean, the basis of science is inquiry [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2909.08s)]
*  and taking your preconceptions and setting them aside and trying to see things. If I know for a [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2914.44s)]
*  fact my car keys are in the kitchen, I'm never going to find them in my bedroom. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2918.52s)]
*  So why would you start with that assumption? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2922.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I agree with your critique. I think it's because we are so, especially in the developed [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2926.12s)]
*  West, focusing on rationality. Again, I'm the Kantian sort of, I think therefore I am, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2931.32s)]
*  Koji Tohigo sum. I'm a thinking thing. That's not a Christian vision of the human person. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2935.7200000000003s)]
*  We are not thinking things. We are in souled bodies, right? And we can have in souled living [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2941.8s)]
*  bodies with a very seriously damaged brain, perhaps a fully dead brain. And what's so interesting, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2946.52s)]
*  again, about children is it looks like the spinal cord can maybe take over for some of what the [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2951.48s)]
*  brain did. And we know that we're conscious beings, right? That's just a brute fact about us. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2956.04s)]
*  And we also know that at least so far, after many decades of trying, we can't find [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2963.16s)]
*  consciousness in the brain anywhere. And so that suggests to me anyway, that consciousness is a [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2967.64s)]
*  product of something else, right? It's not a product of the brain most likely. It's probably [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2973.56s)]
*  a product of some, there are actually some philosophers of mind, secular ones who say [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2976.92s)]
*  it's probably the product of like our whole bodies holistically considered in relationship [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2981.32s)]
*  with each other and our environment. I don't fully understand some of those arguments, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2985.2400000000002s)]
*  but at the very least, I think we need to expand this idea that we're more than just our brains. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2988.76s)]
*  Well, and also at the very least, I think we need to approach medicine and science with renewed [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2992.6800000000003s)]
*  humility. If we don't even know where consciousness resides, self-awareness as people, which is the [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=2998.6800000000003s)]
*  whole, you know, that's the main, that's what makes the brain different from the spinal cord, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3005.56s)]
*  I would argue actually, or we thought made it different, then we don't know squat. And why don't [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3009.32s)]
*  I feel like you're wiser when you concede that rather than bounding forward with the false [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3016.68s)]
*  pretense that you're all knowing, like, why don't we admit that? It helps to believe in God. Why not [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3022.52s)]
*  force doctors to admit that at gunpoint actually? Like, why, how can you get a medical license [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3027.56s)]
*  if you won't admit that? Doctors shots fired. No, no, I'm sorry. I don't mean literally. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3032.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it helps to have a context in which there is a God, right? Who is all knowing and who, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3040.6s)]
*  in whom ultimate truth resides and it's not from you, right? It's not up to us. It's not. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3049.3199999999997s)]
*  I agree. But I mean, I don't know most of my life I haven't spent thinking about God. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3054.8399999999997s)]
*  I do now, but I mean, most of my life I didn't. But I don't know, just trying to be honest with [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3059.24s)]
*  myself, it was always pretty clear to me that I didn't really know anything and that nobody does. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3064.7599999999998s)]
*  And if you're, if you don't know that, then you're dangerous. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3069.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is just pure speculation. I guess I'm just trying to, especially now that I teach at a [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3074.6s)]
*  medical school and I've been in academia for now almost two decades, those kind of [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3078.2799999999997s)]
*  humble approaches are not rewarded in these structures, right? In these systems. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3083.88s)]
*  What is rewarded is saying, I've got the answer, right? Or I'm on my way to finding the answer. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3098.6800000000003s)]
*  I've got this new piece of information about this. That's one of the reasons I think that so many [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3103.08s)]
*  theologians, at least in my world, have reacted negatively to this sort of publish or perish, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3108.2s)]
*  come up with new ideas constantly, sort of a model of higher education. Because boy, oh boy, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3115.08s)]
*  if we're truly exhibiting the virtue of humility in the way you suggest, we need to make far [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3122.2799999999997s)]
*  fewer claims about the kinds of things that we do precisely because we need to be, start with the [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3129.0s)]
*  virtue of humility first. Well, right. And in a, you know, in a system that actually wanted to [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3135.64s)]
*  expand knowledge and perpetuate it, pass it on, there would be much more reading and much less [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3141.48s)]
*  writing. That's right. Much more listening, much less talking. And it seems the opposite. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3147.24s)]
*  That's absolutely true. There's a tremendous amount of pressure put on academics and including those [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3154.92s)]
*  in academic medicine to just publish your ass off, right? And just get paper after paper out [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3162.28s)]
*  there. And we have, as you know, a replication crisis now in part because of this. Can you explain [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3167.7200000000003s)]
*  for people who don't follow what that is? So in part, but not only because of the intense pressure [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3173.1600000000003s)]
*  on academics and especially in academic medicine to advance one's career through publications, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3181.5600000000004s)]
*  there's been a real lack of humility in sort of sitting with data and books and studies [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3187.88s)]
*  and an attempt to sort of just push things out and get your name out there and get your publications [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3197.48s)]
*  out there. And then when people come behind them, and it's actually more and more difficult for [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3201.88s)]
*  people to come behind them because there's not a lot of glory in either confirming what somebody's [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3207.64s)]
*  already published or there's some glory in finding that they were wrong about it. But [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3212.36s)]
*  not a lot of people spend a lot of time trying to confirm or replicate studies. But when they do, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3217.8s)]
*  we now have found a replication crisis that a lot of these. The replication is not just like a virtue, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3223.0800000000004s)]
*  it's a prerequisite for science. That's right. It's a basic scientific precept. If you're going [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3227.7200000000003s)]
*  to make a claim in order for us to declare it true, it has to be replicated. That's right. And [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3231.6400000000003s)]
*  it's a deep and foundational problem that especially in areas which are ideologically [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3237.24s)]
*  charged, let's say, the replication crisis is particularly profound. So it's not just about [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3243.3199999999997s)]
*  publish or perish, get a ton of articles out there to advance your career. It's also to get the right [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3251.72s)]
*  kind of articles out there, the ones that say the right things that have the right conclusions about [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3257.7999999999997s)]
*  some of the issues we've been discussing so far on the show. These are politically charged things [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3262.12s)]
*  and in order to get it published in the best journals, you probably need to have the quote [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3267.0s)]
*  unquote right answer as well. It seems like total corruption. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3272.28s)]
*  It's there's corruption. I mean, there's no, there's absolutely no doubt about it. I mean, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3278.44s)]
*  I experienced this even in my own world of bioethics where you just sort of know what journals [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3283.0s)]
*  you need to submit to if you have a particular sort of argument and a sort of conclusion. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3290.12s)]
*  You say, well, you know, I could submit it there, but it's never going to be published there. It [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3294.84s)]
*  doesn't matter how good the argument is. It doesn't really matter whether I've done good [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3299.4s)]
*  research or have adequately investigated this and I'm making very tight arguments. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3302.6800000000003s)]
*  I have the wrong conclusion for that journal. And so you submit it to a different journal, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3307.96s)]
*  right? And, or you don't submit it at all, or you submit it to an online [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3311.08s)]
*  journal or something that might actually get read by people. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3317.2400000000002s)]
*  Just submit it to Twitter. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3320.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's, that's increasingly where a lot of this is headed. Twitter has actually been [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3322.04s)]
*  one of the places where we've been able to most clearly see the replication crisis right now. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3326.7599999999998s)]
*  I was half joking, but what do you mean? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3333.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, so many of these things before Twitter and before social media happened on the [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3336.2799999999997s)]
*  down low, right? They would just be only the specialists would sort of know like, oh, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3340.2s)]
*  so and so their article got retracted or like so and so followed behind them and wasn't able [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3345.0s)]
*  to replicate their work or, you know, whatever. Now, as soon as that happens, happily, there's a [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3349.0s)]
*  place where you can go and see people saying, Hey, look, this, this data was problematic. This [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3353.32s)]
*  problem, this data was faulty and there's public pressure in fact, to then have the journal address [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3358.04s)]
*  that and say, well, maybe this, you know, we need to have a note here or something like that and [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3363.0s)]
*  address the problem. So that kind of transparency, which is only just a few years old now, I think [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3367.08s)]
*  we've yet to see the end result of that. So [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3374.12s)]
*  I'm sorry, back to the topic that you were explaining before I once again, so rudely sidetracked [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3378.44s)]
*  the conversation, which was brain death and a persistent vegetative state. Right. So when we [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3384.04s)]
*  left, you were explaining, I think that there is no way or universally agreed upon way to measure [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3392.2s)]
*  whether or not a brain is dead. I think that's right. We're trying to get ways, for instance, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3399.72s)]
*  to do a better job testing for hypothalamic function, for instance, and brainstem function. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3404.6s)]
*  But actually one of the difficulties that is pushing us in ways that I find pretty disturbing [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3409.3199999999997s)]
*  about declaring somebody brain dead is a lot of people are sort of throwing up their hands and [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3414.52s)]
*  say, it's actually pretty arbitrary how we test. Like who cares whether we can test for [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3418.12s)]
*  function of the hypothalamus. Who cares actually how much of the brain is dead. They're good. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3424.2799999999997s)]
*  They're not the person they ever will be again or something like this. So [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3428.04s)]
*  there is, there is something in most people that kind of agrees with that though. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3431.72s)]
*  They don't want themselves or their loved ones living on a ventilator. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3438.44s)]
*  Then I think that's fair to say I'm, that's right. And getting back to one of our earlier [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3444.04s)]
*  discussions, it's perfectly legitimate to take somebody off a ventilator, as long as one is not [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3449.96s)]
*  aiming at their own death, right? As long as it's a choice about how to live. If somebody says to me [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3454.52s)]
*  and, you know, my parents, a friend, spouse, listen, Charlie, I would not want to be on a [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3459.24s)]
*  ventilator. So can you make sure I'm not living on a ventilator? It's not that I want to die in any [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3465.7999999999997s)]
*  particular moment. I just don't want to live my life that way. That's again, to use the more [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3469.16s)]
*  fancy language that's foreseen, but not intending one's death, but making a choice about how to live [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3474.3599999999997s)]
*  rather than a choice to die. And we do that all the time, right? Even the food we eat, as your [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3478.68s)]
*  show has hopefully pointed out, is maybe a choice how to live. We can foresee if we eat or behave or [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3483.64s)]
*  exercise a certain way, we have certain outcomes, right? It's a choice about how to live, not a [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3488.44s)]
*  choice about how to die. So that's different from saying, quite different from saying, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3492.44s)]
*  because you're on a ventilator and you don't have the requisite brain activity, you're dead, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3499.0s)]
*  right? You're dead. That's quite different. And so we can perfectly say, and we should say, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3504.2000000000003s)]
*  and let me make this clear if I haven't already, we don't need to keep people alive indefinitely. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3508.12s)]
*  In fact, this is not at all a Christian ethic. I mean, just look up at Christ on the cross. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3513.88s)]
*  It's pretty obvious you don't need to do everything to save your life, right? If we're imitating [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3518.76s)]
*  Christ, the early, the church's martyrs also give a great example of this. It can be a very clear [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3522.04s)]
*  example of idolatry, in fact, to just pursue life, extended life. So I hope I'm making it clear that [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3530.36s)]
*  that's not what I'm saying, that we have to do everything. We should not do everything. We don't [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3538.2000000000003s)]
*  make an idol out of life. At the same time, we don't tell ourselves silly bedtime stories [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3541.64s)]
*  about individuals who gestate children or get their first period as being dead. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3546.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you remember when Democrats used to refer to abortion as something that should be safe, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3551.3199999999997s)]
*  legal and rare? Well, they've changed their view on that. It went from a right to a sacrament, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3555.4s)]
*  and Kamala Harris is celebrating it at full volume. She was the first vice president to visit an [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3561.4s)]
*  abortion mill, and then the Democratic National Convention offered abortions on demand basically [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3566.52s)]
*  right outside the convention hall. As the publication First Things reported, Tim Walz, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3572.04s)]
*  who's running with Harris, supports the right to kill babies after birth to infanticide. And that's [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3577.32s)]
*  true, despite what the fact checkers may tell you. And it's also evil. The media are calling this the [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3582.92s)]
*  abortion election. You shouldn't sit by without registering your position on it. This isn't the [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3589.32s)]
*  pro-choice movement you may remember from 30 years ago. This is something much darker. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3596.12s)]
*  And that's why we have joined forces with preborn, their sponsor of the show and of our speaking tour, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3601.72s)]
*  to do something about it. It's the largest pro-life organization in the United States, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3607.08s)]
*  and they are doing what they should do, which is speaking up against this atrocity, killing babies [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3611.0s)]
*  after birth. No one seems to have the bravery to call that wrong, which it is. But preborn is [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3617.7999999999997s)]
*  calling it out. Their networks of clinics are positioned in the highest abortion areas in the [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3624.52s)]
*  country, and they've rescued 300,000 babies. When a woman considering an abortion searches to end [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3629.24s)]
*  her baby's life, preborn is there. The power of ultrasound combined with the love of God [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3634.2s)]
*  doubles the baby's chance of being born. A single ultrasound costs 28 bucks. Five ultrasounds are 140 [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3639.96s)]
*  bucks, giving women the information they need to make the decision that many of them actually want [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3647.08s)]
*  to make to have a baby. Any gift will help, and all gifts are tax deductible. To donate securely, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3652.6s)]
*  go to preborn.com slash tucker or call pound 250 on your phone. And when asked, use the word baby. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3659.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and I think we should, I agree with everything you've said. I would never want to [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3667.08s)]
*  be in a ventilator. I mean, I'm 55, my kids are grown. I'm, you know, whatever, no reason to [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3672.12s)]
*  want to prolong life to that extent at all. And I think it's degrading and I would hate it. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3677.56s)]
*  So I'm definitely in the do not resuscitate side of this argument and that we are the ethicist, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3682.6s)]
*  but tell me if that's immoral. No, you're perfectly legitimate. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3689.08s)]
*  But I do think we should really care about whether a person is alive or dead. Like I do think we [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3692.2799999999997s)]
*  should fret about these questions because every life has intrinsic value. And again, if you treat [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3697.16s)]
*  people like objects, you're going to wind up murdering millions of them because we've seen [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3702.68s)]
*  that again and again. So to the question of organ donation and quote harvesting organs, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3708.04s)]
*  repulsive phrase, but I think it's still used, right? Harvesting. Yeah. And it's repulsive [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3715.56s)]
*  because it treats people like farmland. Just like a medium in which this thing grows, this heart, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3721.56s)]
*  liver, kidney. I don't like that at all, but it raises the question, are people from whom organs [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3729.0s)]
*  are quote harvested still alive? I think these are deep questions we need to ask Tucker. And [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3735.8s)]
*  I'm giving a talk at the seminary where I teach next week, which is essentially should Catholics [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3741.88s)]
*  be organ donors precisely in light of these questions. Again, I'm an organ donor. I have [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3748.1200000000003s)]
*  people in my life who are walking around right now because of organ donation. It's an incredibly [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3753.48s)]
*  important thing. But again, we should not be telling ourselves false stories about who is alive and who [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3757.7200000000003s)]
*  is dead just because we want more organs. That was the foundational mistake of- So it sounds like [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3762.92s)]
*  we're harvesting organs, taking organs from living people. If brain death is not death, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3767.56s)]
*  then that's definitely what we're doing. Do you think we're doing that? Yeah. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3772.92s)]
*  Okay. So that's kind of heavy. It's really heavy. It's really heavy. I'm sure you're going to be [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3777.2400000000002s)]
*  yelled at for saying that because like, how dare you get in the way of progress, but- [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3781.4s)]
*  And let me say it for a third time. I'm an organ donor. I support organ donation. Yes. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3785.64s)]
*  I also support telling the truth about whether people are alive or dead. And to get back to [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3789.96s)]
*  the original reason for bringing this up, Peter Singer and I both agree that it was this foundational [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3796.2s)]
*  place where we said an obviously living human being no longer counts as a legal person and [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3801.56s)]
*  therefore we can take their organs. That was the foundational shift where we moved away from [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3805.72s)]
*  fundamental human equality and we moved it to something else. And then we slid into persistent [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3810.44s)]
*  vegetative state. You probably remember the Terry Shivo case very well. Very well. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3815.32s)]
*  Terry Shivo, for your listeners who aren't aware, was a woman who also underwent a catastrophic [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3820.52s)]
*  brain injury due to an eating disorder, as I recall. And her husband and her family [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3826.6000000000004s)]
*  disagreed about what should be done. To be clear, persistent so-called vegetative state, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3833.32s)]
*  no human being is a vegetable, but that's just sort of the language we use or have used. It's [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3837.48s)]
*  changing now. But she did not have brain death. A large part of her brain had been [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3842.92s)]
*  fundamentally compromised, but she had sleep and wake cycles and she responded. There's an [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3851.4s)]
*  amazing video online you can watch of her responding to music. Somebody plays music. She [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3855.4s)]
*  just sort of leans over and sort of makes a noise that sort of almost smiles. People who were there, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3859.2400000000002s)]
*  like her parents said, they responded to her. It was a huge fight. You remember it. It sort [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3866.44s)]
*  of engulfed the nation in the early part of this millennium, early aughts. Anyway, it's interesting. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3870.84s)]
*  I think Nefarious' husband won that battle and they starved her and dehydrated her to death [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3880.28s)]
*  after declaring essentially that she was no longer there. In fact, if anybody would challenge me on [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3887.32s)]
*  this, I challenge them to look at the gravestone that her husband created for her. It says that [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3892.92s)]
*  on the date of her catastrophic brain injury, that she departed this earth. I think it was 1990. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3899.96s)]
*  He uses the phrase departed this earth. I think it was 2003 when they dehydrated her to death. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3906.36s)]
*  It says she was at peace. When I give talks on this topic, I often start with that gravestone [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3913.88s)]
*  as a really indicative, important insight into what we are doing here. What we are saying [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3920.44s)]
*  is this individual has departed this earth as a person and yet can leave behind somehow [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3929.96s)]
*  a body that is responding to music, has sleep-wake cycles, all the things. Now, even since that time, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3937.8s)]
*  Tucker, maybe you are or you aren't aware of this, there's been research into people who've been [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3944.04s)]
*  lumped into this category of vegetative state. Joe Fins, who's a secular bioethicist, wrote a [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3947.88s)]
*  great book called Rights Come to Mind if listeners want to explore it. We now know that a significant [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3954.36s)]
*  percentage of people in a so-called vegetative state are actually conscious. They've done scans [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3960.36s)]
*  of their brains, fMRI scans, and they ask them yes or no questions with yes being imagine you're [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3965.8s)]
*  playing tennis and no being read a book in your room. They answer by what parts of their brain [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3972.36s)]
*  light up correctly. They answer these yes or no questions correctly. We've further learned that [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3980.2000000000003s)]
*  with the right kind of therapies, Joe Fins points out in this book, you can actually prove that more [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3985.48s)]
*  and more either they weren't conscious before and then they become conscious because of the therapy [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3991.88s)]
*  or they were conscious the whole time and the therapies end up showing that they give them [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=3997.48s)]
*  opportunity. In fact, he tells this amazing story of this neurologist who was working on a patient [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4002.36s)]
*  and suddenly he realized she was blinking and trying to communicate with her through her blinking. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4006.68s)]
*  Just an extraordinary story. But yet, so many people have this idea that Terry Chiavo's husband [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4012.12s)]
*  had, which is like people who are in a vegetative state have departed this earth despite this human [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4019.88s)]
*  body that is very clearly here. I see that as the sort of next step from brain death to say, well, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4024.44s)]
*  that's why some people aren't too concerned about whether the hypothalamus is really [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4029.16s)]
*  functioning or not because who cares at the end of the day. So it's the concern that I'm concerned [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4032.2000000000003s)]
*  about or the lack of concern. These are all emotional subjects for people, particularly the [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4035.56s)]
*  end of life stuff because everyone by middle age has seen it with a loved one and it's so sad and [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4041.48s)]
*  you imagine yourself in that position. You think I don't want this for myself. I understand all of [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4047.48s)]
*  that. I'm not judging anybody. But the core idea is so important that all of us have identical [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4051.56s)]
*  moral value because without it, society becomes really dark and evil. Not just in the way we [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4059.4s)]
*  treat the weak in hospice or in neonatal care, but in the way that we treat everybody, the way our [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4068.92s)]
*  economy is structured. So when I was a kid, I grew up in a rich world. Rich people had a sense of [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4078.68s)]
*  noblesse oblige, like we're fortunate. That was the word people used, but there are good people [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4084.3599999999997s)]
*  who are not fortunate and we should feel at the very least bad about that. We're not gods because [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4089.56s)]
*  we're rich. I know, I was there. That was a prevalent feeling, but it's totally absent. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4094.68s)]
*  You think Larry Fink thinks that poor people are as good as him? No, he's like a disgusting [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4101.0s)]
*  money worshipper who thinks he's better than poor people. They all think that. It's not just Larry [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4106.04s)]
*  Fink, though he's obviously genuinely repulsive, but they're all that way. That's a big change, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4110.76s)]
*  is it not? Am I imagining this? Well, this gets back to the dedicate, right? Because when they [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4117.4s)]
*  contrasted the way of life with the way of death, they weren't just interested in what you might [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4122.84s)]
*  call today classical bioethics issues of abortion and infanticide. They were interested in what you [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4126.36s)]
*  just described, right? Yeah, the rest of life from birth till death. There's a lot of years in there. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4131.48s)]
*  The rich and unjust judges of the poor were named explicitly in the dedicate as part of the way of [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4135.72s)]
*  death. Part of the way of death. And all the early church fathers, Tucker, thought about abandoning [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4140.76s)]
*  the poor as akin to indirect homicide, right? And you owe the poor from your substance, actually, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4145.64s)]
*  and you put your salvation in peril if you don't give from your substance to the poor because they [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4152.2s)]
*  deserve it. It's owed them as a matter of natural right. If you have too much, you owe it to them. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4157.16s)]
*  And this isn't something that's made up. It comes right out of sacred scripture. Jesus couldn't be [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4162.44s)]
*  more clear about this. That culture was still alive when I was a kid. Like, I remember that very well. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4166.36s)]
*  I remember people saying that, and I remember them acting like it was true. And these are not even [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4171.639999999999s)]
*  faithful Christians that I grew up around at all. But there was this feeling you had a moral [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4175.879999999999s)]
*  obligation to help people beneath you, not to scoff at them, not to try and put their presidential [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4179.4s)]
*  candidate in prison, but to listen to them and help them. It's all gone. It's gone. I mean, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4184.599999999999s)]
*  just get there. Back in the day, I think it was a medieval practice. Rich people would routinely [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4189.64s)]
*  ask, invite the poor beggars outside the cathedral to pray for their loved ones at their funeral, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4199.08s)]
*  because they would think these people bear the face of Christ in a special way. And I better get- [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4206.6s)]
*  Well, that's taken directly, of course, from Australia to the New Testament. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4211.96s)]
*  Yeah. And that's what I've loved so much about this kind of shift that we've seen. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4215.64s)]
*  I don't know if it's on the right or that's even the way to describe it today. You've been [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4225.4800000000005s)]
*  an important leader, I think, in this shift for conservatives, for people who are more traditional [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4229.4800000000005s)]
*  to say, we don't need to choose, actually, between more traditional pro-life ideas and human dignity [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4234.92s)]
*  and focusing on giving the poor what they are owed, giving the most vulnerable social classes [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4243.32s)]
*  what they are owed. In fact, not only do we not have to choose between them, it's part of the same [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4250.52s)]
*  ethic. It's part of the same vision. It's part of the same seeing individuals as not mere things to [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4254.52s)]
*  be discarded, but as fellow image bearers, exactly the same as I am in value totally. And again, to [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4259.400000000001s)]
*  go back to the debate that the vice presidential candidates had recently, it was so heartening for [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4266.2s)]
*  me to hear JD Vance talk about both to say, yeah, we got some challenges right now with prenatal [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4273.24s)]
*  justice and we have to re-earn trust, but we don't need to choose between trying to protect babies [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4279.96s)]
*  in utero and neonatally now and supporting very poor women and families who feel pushed often [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4286.36s)]
*  into contexts where they have a desperate situation in front of them and they don't know what else to [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4297.16s)]
*  do. And so to have someone like him be so public about saying, we're going to do both of these [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4302.92s)]
*  things together. We're going to pursue prenatal justice and we're going to pursue economic justice [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4309.32s)]
*  for women and families who are in these difficult circumstances. What a beautiful thing. If that [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4313.4800000000005s)]
*  takes fire, if that takes hold, I am just so excited about what that could mean. Because [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4318.92s)]
*  this is something I haven't really emphasized. I want to make sure I emphasize this, Tucker. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4327.08s)]
*  In so many of these contexts that we've been discussing this, the push away from fundamental [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4330.6s)]
*  human equality has been in part a question of resources, a question of consumerism, a question [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4335.64s)]
*  of allocation of resources. So again, with brain death, what pushed it? Organs, right? So many [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4343.8s)]
*  people thought Terry Shivo, why would we put resources into caring for her? Why would anybody [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4350.84s)]
*  put... Joe Finn says, hey, I'm trying to tell people you can help people in these states and [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4354.68s)]
*  we can actually bring them back and let's get on the horn here and let's figure out how to do this. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4360.12s)]
*  And he's had crickets from his colleagues. Because we've got wars to fund. We've got lots [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4364.44s)]
*  of things that people... Well, we have a lot of wars and I have to say that's the last... And I [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4368.839999999999s)]
*  will get off my soapbox, but that is the last big effect of this attitude change is the callousness [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4372.28s)]
*  that you see displayed everywhere on the right a lot. And universally on the left now about [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4379.4s)]
*  the killing of other people. It's like, I don't know if you're in a war with somebody and it's [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4385.4s)]
*  a just war, maybe you have to kill people, but you should never gloat over it. You should never be [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4389.799999999999s)]
*  happy or cavalier about the deaths, particularly if like huge civilian populations of million [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4394.36s)]
*  people in Iraq. And no one has obviously no one has gone to prison. Lots of people should go to [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4400.2s)]
*  prison for it. No one ever will. But we should at least say that's really bad. That's like a million [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4405.0s)]
*  human beings or what's going on in the Middle East now. I mean, half the right, the whole daily wire [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4409.08s)]
*  every day, they're so excited about all these people getting killed. And it's like, there's not [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4415.4s)]
*  one person who stands up and says, look, I'm not for this or that group. These people are terrorists. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4419.96s)]
*  That's all fine. I get all that. I'm not even contesting it. But if civilians get killed, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4424.68s)]
*  non-combatants get killed, we should feel bad about that. I don't understand. And if we don't [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4429.32s)]
*  feel bad about that, that suggests a darkness that's really scary. And it's no surprise that [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4434.28s)]
*  the same people who are thrilled when giant bombs drop on apartment blocks, those people have, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4441.8s)]
*  I think, really dark attitudes about Americans who say, die of fentanyl O.D.s or find their towns [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4449.08s)]
*  invaded by people who shouldn't be here or whatever, victims of crime. They don't care [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4454.2s)]
*  because they don't care about other people, actually. That's the theme that connects those two. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4459.719999999999s)]
*  It connects all of this. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4465.08s)]
*  Oh, I couldn't. And I'm thinking of a couple leaders on the so-called right, they're not [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4466.04s)]
*  conservative in any sense that I recognize at all, who are like this. And I just, I think to myself, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4470.839999999999s)]
*  I can't believe I'm in the same category with these people. I have nothing in common with them. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4477.08s)]
*  I'm never going to celebrate someone's death ever. Why would you? And it's wrong. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4480.76s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4486.92s)]
*  And what a beauty. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4487.24s)]
*  Do you see this? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4488.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And by the way, this is, again, I hate to keep coming back to this, but maybe I'll pull [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4489.16s)]
*  my moral theologian card one more time. This is just Jesus and the Gospels and the early church [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4494.84s)]
*  again, right? This is this anti-war swords into plowshares, turn the other cheek, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4501.16s)]
*  love your enemies. Augustine thought it was so important to love your enemies that he was not [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4508.28s)]
*  a pacifist, but he said, if you're going to kill your enemies, you got to do it out of love for [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4511.96s)]
*  your enemies. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4515.64s)]
*  Well, I agree with that, or at least it should be accompanied by guilt and shame. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4516.04s)]
*  I've done all kinds of bad things in my life. I'm sure I'll do more, unfortunately, but [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4520.5199999999995s)]
*  my only defense would be, I think I felt guilt and shame, probably not enough. You should feel bad. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4524.92s)]
*  And I even, I'm probably make myself super unpopular for saying this, but I remember when [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4531.32s)]
*  Osama bin Laden got shot to death and I hated Osama bin Laden, he killed a friend of mine, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4536.44s)]
*  actually. I'm not for Osama bin Laden, but I thought, you know, we should just have, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4540.2s)]
*  when someone dies, we should have reverence for death itself. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4545.88s)]
*  I mean, we can be happy that someone who was attacking us is gone and the threat is gone. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4550.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that's worth celebrating, but we should never feel glee watching a human soul [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4554.28s)]
*  be extinguished. I just don't, I think that's a really ugly habit to get into. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4562.44s)]
*  And it diminishes us and turns us into monsters. It turns us into Osama bin Laden type people. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4567.72s)]
*  And I didn't have the balls to say this at the time, but I remember thinking, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4573.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm not into celebrating some guy, an unarmed man getting shot in the face. I don't care if it's [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4576.679999999999s)]
*  Osama bin Laden, the guy I like least. But that's precisely. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4581.0s)]
*  Okay. I probably shouldn't even have said that, but I felt that at the time. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4585.0s)]
*  It sounds like you're talking about trying to find a way to love your enemy. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4589.56s)]
*  I don't think a country can, I mean, could there really be a truly Christian country [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4593.4s)]
*  that loved its enemies? Maybe we get invaded the first day. I don't know. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4597.4s)]
*  I'm not a statesman or a theologian, so I don't have to make these, but I just think at the level [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4601.08s)]
*  of the individual, the human being, we should be on guard for the natural impulse to treat other [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4604.76s)]
*  people as objects and to worship death. I just think it's important not to worship death. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4612.6s)]
*  I just, I don't know. I mean, all of us have it in ourselves. How many videos have I seen on the [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4620.52s)]
*  internet of someone, you know, a robber getting shot to death at a 7-Eleven and I'm like, you go [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4625.4800000000005s)]
*  shoot that robber. Like, I get it. I understand that impulse. It's very human, but it's ugly. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4631.0s)]
*  And we should fight against it. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4637.08s)]
*  That's right. That's right. And, and again, what a beautiful image of human dignity, an image of [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4638.52s)]
*  resisting a throwaway culture that would combine all these things together to see them and not as [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4647.56s)]
*  dichotomous or even strange. But of course you would be for anti-war. Of course you would be [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4653.24s)]
*  for justice for impoverished and middle-class populations who are under siege. Of course you [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4659.72s)]
*  would be for disability rights. Of course you would be anti-abortion. Of course you would be [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4665.48s)]
*  anti-infanticide. And of course you would be anti-euthanasia physician, cystic link, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4671.0s)]
*  because it's all part of the same vision. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4674.84s)]
*  And not throwing away old people and putting them in some super depressing [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4676.2s)]
*  facility. I don't know the whole thing. I don't think there's any surprise [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4680.44s)]
*  when I look at how little our leaders care about Americans. They just don't care. They step over [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4687.32s)]
*  the bodies of drug addicts on the way to go vote to fund the Ukraine war. Like those two things, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4693.24s)]
*  those two facts are connected. I think if you don't care about people, you will mistreat them. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4699.88s)]
*  And the last category you should have ruling over you is people who don't care about other people. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4705.48s)]
*  Can I say one thing about older people here in light of this? Especially those who are, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4711.64s)]
*  I mean we're in the midst, we're in the very early stages of a dementia crisis as you know. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4719.0s)]
*  What is that? Can you be more specific? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4722.68s)]
*  Sure. So we already don't care properly for reasons you just suggested for people with [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4725.240000000001s)]
*  moderate and later stage dementia. It's not like we're going to be able to do that. We're going to [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4732.92s)]
*  be able to do that. Essentially we shuffle them off into so-called care homes. And really, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4737.48s)]
*  the New York Times has this very interesting expose about how many of them are treated. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4745.719999999999s)]
*  And essentially many of them, a high percentage, because they're sort of difficult to take care of [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4749.16s)]
*  in some contexts, are given anti-psychotic drugs. Not because they have any psychosis, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4752.759999999999s)]
*  but as essentially a way of keeping them more docile. In part because we don't put enough [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4759.08s)]
*  resources into caring for them. And I don't know about you Tucker, but when I talk to immigrants [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4763.64s)]
*  about how we treat our elderly and those who have dementia, they are shocked. They are shocked that [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4766.52s)]
*  we put them away in the way that we do. We literally throw them away into a room until they die. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4772.28s)]
*  This is what we're doing now. In the next 20 years, unless the mean siblings get what they want in [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4778.68s)]
*  terms of treating type 3 diabetes, the number of people with later stage dementia, they're going to [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4784.92s)]
*  with the number of people with later stage dementia is going to double. In 30 years, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4790.84s)]
*  it's going to triple. In 30 years, Tucker, what are we going to do with three times the number [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4794.68s)]
*  of people with dementia? Are we going to adequately care for them? Are we going to find new ways to [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4799.56s)]
*  help them? Or are we going to slouch towards physician assisted killing as we do? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4805.400000000001s)]
*  We're going to kill them. We're going to kill them. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4808.280000000001s)]
*  We're going to do what Canada is doing. That's right. And so that's the next, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4809.64s)]
*  in a book I wrote called Losing Our Dignity, How Secularized Medicine is Undermining Fun [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4816.360000000001s)]
*  Human Equality, I finished the last three chapters by saying this is the next shoot [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4820.92s)]
*  a drop in our loss of fundamental equality. We're going to end up saying that individuals [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4826.6s)]
*  who've lost their rationality and self-awareness at the end of life no longer count as persons. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4831.0s)]
*  Just as we say it about prenatal and neonatal children, just as we say it about those in a so [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4834.52s)]
*  called vegetative state, just as we say it about those in a so called brain dead state, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4840.6s)]
*  Canada is already saying it about individuals at the end of life with later stage dementia. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4844.36s)]
*  Unless we can have a recovery of the concept of fundamental human equality, and I hope you [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4851.88s)]
*  don't mind me asking you this question, the only hope I really have that we don't have a dementia [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4857.48s)]
*  crisis along the lines we suggest is if there's a kind of revival, a kind of recovery of the kinds of [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4863.0s)]
*  the vision of human dignity, fundamental equality that we've been talking about here. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4871.4s)]
*  You've spent the last month or so traveling around the country, I've heard you say you've been, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4877.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know if the pretty words your mouth here, but rejuvenated or you have some sort of really [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4884.759999999999s)]
*  positive experience as a result of this. Do you think, you know I'm isolated in academia in a lot [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4889.4s)]
*  of ways, do you think we can have a kind of revival in this country that could recapture [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4897.160000000001s)]
*  a vision of human dignity that would cause us to say, yes, grandpa, dad, my neighbor, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4903.8s)]
*  he doesn't know his name, he doesn't know his wife's name, but he matters just the same as [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4912.280000000001s)]
*  anyone else and we are going to rearrange our lives to care for him in his final journey on this earth? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4918.120000000001s)]
*  Or do you think the ship has sailed, like we've just jettisoned, the cut flowers are dying, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4925.08s)]
*  there's no way to reattach them to the roots and we just have to find a way to work through it somehow? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4932.28s)]
*  I mean, one of the reasons that immigrants can't believe how we treat our elderly is because they [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4937.16s)]
*  have intact families and we don't. So it's pretty hard when you have a lot of elderly without any [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4943.8s)]
*  family actually, way more than any other time in our history. This is just one among countless [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4951.48s)]
*  issues that every person deals with every single day that turn on how we see each other. Do we see [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4960.599999999999s)]
*  other human beings as fellow human beings, as people with souls whose lives inherently matter, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4968.919999999999s)]
*  whether we like them or the life they're living or not, it's kind of not up to us. How do we [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4976.2s)]
*  see ourselves? Do we understand ourselves as subjects to a greater authority, not a government [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4981.32s)]
*  authority, but authority above that? Or do we see ourselves as gods? I mean, these are all basic [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4988.44s)]
*  questions. And I think the way that we understand all of these things depends on our core understanding [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=4994.12s)]
*  of who we are and how much power we have. Do you really believe you have the right to kill somebody [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5001.96s)]
*  except in self-defense? Where do we get that idea? Only God has that power. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5008.44s)]
*  I will just say this. Here's what I believe is happening. I think the last 80 years, really, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5012.759999999999s)]
*  since we dropped that second bomb on Nagasaki have been an anomaly in human history. And I think [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5018.36s)]
*  because of these profound technological, very rapid technological advances, people have lost context [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5025.4s)]
*  and lost perspective on themselves. And I think they think they're God. And the result has been [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5032.12s)]
*  a pretty hollow culture. It was just based on buying crap and sensual pleasure. And I don't [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5041.32s)]
*  think that, you know, I'm not going to say buying crap or sensual pleasure. I've engaged in both [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5047.5599999999995s)]
*  quite ardently, but I don't think in the end they satisfy. It is like eating Snickers bars, which [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5051.0s)]
*  I've also done a lot of, and they just don't fill you up. And I do think that there's a [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5058.84s)]
*  recognition of that among almost every single person I know. And the result is a spiritual [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5064.84s)]
*  yearning that's becoming explicit. And what that becomes, I have no idea. I'm terrible at predictions, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5071.400000000001s)]
*  but it is a kind of revival underway. There's no question about it right now. And that will change [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5076.84s)]
*  people's attitudes. You're not going to change. One of the things I've learned from covering politics [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5081.72s)]
*  for more than 30 years is that we're coming at the story at the very end. If there's a real debate [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5086.2s)]
*  over a law, then that means that, or even if you get a law, attitudes have changed on the ground, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5092.92s)]
*  fundamentally. And I think people's attitudes are changing back. I do think. And with the rise of AI [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5100.44s)]
*  and transhumanism and phenomenon that are really designed to degrade and eliminate people and make [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5112.2s)]
*  them redundant, irrelevant, that is the point of AI and transhumanism is to kind of eliminate people. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5118.5199999999995s)]
*  The body. Yeah, the body and the mind. Actually both. I think people can feel that, it scares the crap [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5124.92s)]
*  out of them. And they're reacting against that. Thank heaven. And I know, of course, it's not too [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5131.8s)]
*  late. I mean, AI and transhumanism will, you know, a thousand or 10,000 years ago from now will seem [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5137.48s)]
*  like the absurd jokes they are. I mean, AI is not going to extinguish people forever. It may extinguish [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5145.32s)]
*  99% of them, but people will live on and they'll mock AI, you know, in future generations and [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5152.839999999999s)]
*  transhumanism will just be like phrenology or some other stupid cult that we make fun of, slavery. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5160.04s)]
*  You know, some of them will look back on it and think, do people really do that? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5167.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? It's absurd. It's like, it's only for creepy billionaires in the tech [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5171.24s)]
*  world think that's a good idea. And of course they're being controlled by spiritual forces, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5177.72s)]
*  by demons. That's so obvious to me, but they're not going to win. Are you joking? They're not going to [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5181.8s)]
*  win. They may win short term, but they're not going to win long term. So anyway, yeah, no, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5186.84s)]
*  I think there's massive change in people's deepest feelings about the world right now. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5190.92s)]
*  And I think it's fair to call it a revival. It's my sense too. And in part because I've listened to [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5199.32s)]
*  some of the people you've interviewed and talked with over the last few weeks. And I've looked at [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5205.4800000000005s)]
*  some of the data, which suggests that there's actually young men are the ones leading a return [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5212.44s)]
*  to church. 18 to 29 year olds are leading a return to church. In fact that more- [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5220.2s)]
*  Yeah, like how much can you eat? How many random people can you sleep with? It's not that fun. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5226.679999999999s)]
*  How much time can you spend on your phone? How much porn can you watch? It's a deep, and they [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5230.5199999999995s)]
*  have a very strong sense too, maybe even better than you and I have about it being foisted on them. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5237.24s)]
*  Just grew up in a culture that had these structures already in place. And interestingly, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5242.44s)]
*  when some of my colleagues do things like teach a class that would involve a technology fast, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5249.5599999999995s)]
*  for instance, those classes are totally full. And people want to get out of it. They want an [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5255.48s)]
*  excuse to get out of it. They want an excuse to get out of it. I just am amazed, given how many [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5262.12s)]
*  addictions I've beaten in my life, things I never thought I would stop doing, like smoking, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5269.56s)]
*  especially. Amazingly, I quit at the age of 45 or drinking. No problem. I quit it. No problem. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5274.200000000001s)]
*  I never would go back to either one of those things. Pretty hard to get off bad food and your [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5282.76s)]
*  phone. I'll just say from my own experience, I think I'm pretty good at beating addiction. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5288.4400000000005s)]
*  Hard to get off your phone. Hard to stop eating Wheat Thins. Those are very addictive, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5293.719999999999s)]
*  both of those things. And we've got, as you've talked about on your show a few times now, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5300.28s)]
*  we've got the best scientists, including social scientists and chemists and others [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5305.24s)]
*  who are working very hard to make sure that's the case, because it makes a lot of people a lot of [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5312.599999999999s)]
*  money. Well, yeah. I sort of missed the porn thing and thank God I didn't grow up with that. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5316.6s)]
*  And obviously my phone's totally monitored, so even if I was into porn, I would not like to porn, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5325.4800000000005s)]
*  which I'm not. But my sense is that the whole country is addicted to porn. I don't know too [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5331.240000000001s)]
*  much about it. Oh, it's an extraordinary thing. I mean, we basically have a pornified culture, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5336.360000000001s)]
*  or the kind of things that you and I grew up with is sort of odd. You say, well, that's how a porn [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5341.56s)]
*  star dresses, or these are attitudes that come from porn, this thing that's out there that's [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5345.32s)]
*  separate from the rest of the culture. It's now pretty well accepted that the culture itself has [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5351.48s)]
*  been pornified. So the logic of porn is now the logic of the culture more broadly. In fact, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5355.799999999999s)]
*  this is how most young people today understand what sex is and what it's for. This is why, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5360.12s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen in recent, I think it's been over the last couple of years, this [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5366.679999999999s)]
*  has been a phenomenon. More and more women report being choked during sex, right? This is a phenomenon [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5369.96s)]
*  that's just come up almost directly because young men and boys see this on their phones and on their [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5376.92s)]
*  TV screens, right? Yeah, I don't know. Again, I'm 55, thank heaven. But I'll be gone soon, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5383.24s)]
*  won't have to deal with any of this stuff. But since you brought up something that forbidden [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5390.12s)]
*  and naughty, I'll just say for whatever it's worth, probably nothing. But I've heard a lot [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5396.68s)]
*  about this from younger people I come into contact with. And it sounds like that's driven [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5401.96s)]
*  100% by women, just being honest from every report. I mean, I was so shocked the first time I heard [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5408.200000000001s)]
*  that since I don't really see a connection between violence and sex I never have. It's just deeply [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5413.56s)]
*  unappealing to me. Maybe I'm revealing too much here. But I mean it. We all have preferences. I've [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5419.320000000001s)]
*  never really understood that. Violence? Really? No, violence is not hot. But anyway, here's the [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5426.12s)]
*  point. I've talked to like more than three young men who were like, oh yeah, this is like a constant [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5431.64s)]
*  request that I'm not that into from women. Okay, I didn't know that. I've heard that so much that I [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5437.24s)]
*  think it's really interesting. What is that? I don't know what that's about. I don't know what [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5441.72s)]
*  that's about. But it does show that the impact now is not just on men, right? So we used to think [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5446.92s)]
*  that porn was mostly consumed. It still is, I think. The numbers say mostly by men and boys. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5451.8s)]
*  But with that, I think it really strongly indicates is that women and girls are also [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5456.52s)]
*  consumed. You know, I really, I don't know. I'm really interested in how people live just because [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5459.96s)]
*  I'm a curious person. So I've like, I always ask questions about all sorts of stuff with people, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5464.12s)]
*  probably too many questions. But, but do you know who has the most sex and the best sex of all? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5469.16s)]
*  Yeah, married people. Married people. By far. By far. And I know that as a pretty very pro-sex [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5473.96s)]
*  Protestant, because I'm for reproduction, you know, it seems like people are not having sex. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5480.28s)]
*  No, they're not. I would joke with my students and say, you know, you guys claim to be these [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5487.16s)]
*  wild people and you look at my generation, older generation is fuddy-duddy's or whatever. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5491.4s)]
*  That's not what the numbers say. No, that's not what the numbers say at all. And so it's interesting [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5495.48s)]
*  to think about what that is. It doesn't seem to be a kind of, I mean, it's not clear. I mean, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5499.639999999999s)]
*  if there is a revival underway and if young men are returning to church in significant ways, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5503.32s)]
*  maybe it has something to do with that. But could also be just again, the ubiquity of sitting around [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5508.04s)]
*  playing video games and watching porn all day long too. Well, it does. My strong overwhelming [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5512.44s)]
*  sense is that the distrust between the sexes, particularly among younger people, is kind of the [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5517.88s)]
*  defining fact. Like they don't trust each other and they don't, they seem to have a lot of trouble [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5522.84s)]
*  getting along. I don't know. I don't want this to turn into like a long catalog of all of our social [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5527.4s)]
*  problems. But I guess all I'm saying is in response to your original question, I think [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5531.88s)]
*  things are coming to a head where whatever we're doing is just not working at all. And that's become [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5538.28s)]
*  really obvious at every level. At the personal level, men and women are having a lot of trouble [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5543.72s)]
*  understanding each other, getting married, having children, buying a home, finding a job that sustains [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5549.0s)]
*  all of that. You know, it's the basic middle-class life that's like beyond people's reach. And then [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5555.56s)]
*  looming above us is the constant threat of annihilation by AI or war, things that were [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5560.12s)]
*  created by our lunatic leaders, like actual lunatics who run the country, who hate us and [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5568.36s)]
*  hate humanity. But everyone feels that anxiety of like, holy shit, any minute this could all end. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5573.16s)]
*  And that's a weird environment. Like I grew up during the Cold War, you know, I was on my [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5580.28s)]
*  honeymoon when it ended, so that's how old I am. And I never felt, I was sort of aware, you know? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5584.04s)]
*  Yeah. I never really felt like any second we could die in a nuclear conflagration. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5590.12s)]
*  Now I definitely feel that way. Don't you? And we have obviously something that didn't exist back [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5596.68s)]
*  then, our addiction to our phones and our social media, which is constantly calibrated to make us [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5602.68s)]
*  feel anxious and depressed. And it works. And it totally works. Again, we got the best social [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5607.32s)]
*  scientists in the world working for these companies. It would be strange if we weren't. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5612.28s)]
*  It'd be strange if we weren't. How long after you wake up, do you check your phone? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5616.84s)]
*  Oh my gosh. I don't want to admit it. It's okay. I've admitted I love wheat thins. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5620.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, my phone is my alarm clock. So like for so many people. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5625.32s)]
*  So immediately. So my phone wakes me up and then my phone is in my hand. And so I see the notifications [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5633.4s)]
*  on my phone and I want to see what's going on in the news that day or somebody's texted me. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5639.64s)]
*  Right when you wake up. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So how bad for your spirit is that? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5643.96s)]
*  It's horrific. Like how many mornings have been wrecked? You're speaking for everyone right now, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5647.96s)]
*  not just yourself. I'm mostly speaking, I mean, to be honest with you about my, but I'm definitely [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5653.160000000001s)]
*  speaking for lots of other people. Yeah, you are. Yeah. But how many mornings have you sort of woken [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5656.360000000001s)]
*  up and there's your bride next to you and maybe a dog or two and you're sort of happy and sunlight [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5661.320000000001s)]
*  streaming in and you pick up your phone and you think, Oh man, Western civilization is over. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5666.92s)]
*  I mean, we just spent an hour and a half talking about infanticide. So like, you know, the kinds [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5672.84s)]
*  of things I think about almost all day long are horrific things. Right. So I, and my algorithm [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5678.4400000000005s)]
*  knows that. So I get sent these things. People also send these things because they know I'm [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5683.72s)]
*  interested. Right. So, Oh, did you see what so-and-so hospital is doing now and that this, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5688.2s)]
*  that and the other. So yeah, I mean, it's something that I've thought about and many of us, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5692.12s)]
*  I'm sure have thought about for a long time now is how do we, how can I do my job? How can I [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5698.04s)]
*  be aware of the things I need to be aware of? And yet have a much healthier and people have written [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5704.68s)]
*  books and I've read the books that I've talked with other people. My wife and I have talked about [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5710.6s)]
*  this at some length, how we can negotiate these things in our life. Cause she's not as bad as I [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5715.4s)]
*  am, but it's, you know, she's involved in this, in this lifestyle as well. But, but again, the, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5720.2s)]
*  the companies that make shit tons of money from this stuff have, have hired the best social [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5725.48s)]
*  scientists in the world to make sure that we, that we, that we're going to try to do the best job to [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5731.24s)]
*  make us fail in these, in these opportunities. And I've tried multiple times. We even have this [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5736.92s)]
*  thing that we haven't used yet. We bought it. It's apparently this box you can sort of put your [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5741.24s)]
*  phone into and like, you have to have a specific combination to open it. It's sitting there in our [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5745.8s)]
*  kitchen sort of laughing at us because we haven't used it, but it's there as a reminder, like we [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5751.24s)]
*  probably should be using this thing. But yeah. I used to feel that way about drinking, you know, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5755.4800000000005s)]
*  Sunday morning, I'd think I've just, I've got to stop this. This is just too bad. And you know, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5761.0s)]
*  ultimately I did, but, and I always knew I would like, you can't be that hung over and like keep [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5766.68s)]
*  doing it. But I suspect I'll never get rid of this. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5772.36s)]
*  So how do we live with it? Like, what is the, what is the good way that we live with those things? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5778.44s)]
*  It's, it's very, it's, it's, it's difficult for me to imagine. Cause I've thought about this, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5784.36s)]
*  I've obsessed frankly over this question. And, and I think we need to, I think one of the solutions [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5788.759999999999s)]
*  is to have a community of people, right around you that can hold you accountable for this. And [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5795.719999999999s)]
*  so much of what happens here, it seems to me anyway, is we lead isolated lives. Unlike the [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5800.28s)]
*  lives we used to lead, both as a species and sort of as a culture, not that long ago, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5806.2s)]
*  where there could be people that would hold you accountable to that sort of thing. Like [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5810.12s)]
*  I at least would of course make my kids leave their phones away from the dinner table. For [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5813.5599999999995s)]
*  instance, that's one small thing you can do. But now I find myself at the dinner table, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5818.44s)]
*  pulling it out, right. And say, well, we're at dessert. I guess I can sort of check and see [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5823.5599999999995s)]
*  what's going on. Of course. Are you, or in a restaurant, people leave it on the table. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5826.68s)]
*  Like they used to leave a pack of cigarettes. They leave the phone. I prefer the cigarettes, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5829.96s)]
*  less, less harmful, much less harmful. I think there's a strong case for that. Oh my God, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5835.320000000001s)]
*  Marlboro's compared to the iPhone. Bring back the Marlboro's. Are you joking? Yes. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5840.200000000001s)]
*  So you live to 65. So you know what I mean? Okay. So I want to get back, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5846.6s)]
*  speaking of holding people accountable. So doctors have a unique power in that they are [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5851.4800000000005s)]
*  president at the beginning and the end of life and they have the power to kill. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5855.88s)]
*  And it's not regulated at all. I've noticed. And so really we're all dependent on the attitudes [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5860.6s)]
*  of physicians to stay alive. Like we need them to be pro-life, not simply against abortion, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5866.2s)]
*  but in favor of life as a default position or else we're screwed. And yet so many of them, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5875.4800000000005s)]
*  I have in my personal experience are vehemently pro-death. And I'm not saying all, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5883.08s)]
*  but most doctors I have known are strongly pro-death. So what do you do about that? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5889.88s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we are living through an epic change right now in our culture, a change with regard to [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5895.8s)]
*  our technology, a change with regard to our politics, a change perhaps with regard to this [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5904.36s)]
*  religious revival that may be coming. We currently have a medical culture, which is dominated by [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5909.8s)]
*  secularism, by a hostility to the vision of human dignity and equality that we've been [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5917.56s)]
*  articulating so far. Could that change? I think the answer is yes. It could also change in a very [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5923.88s)]
*  similar way to the way that younger people more generally are changing. So young doctors, young [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5930.52s)]
*  nurses, young whoever will be caring for us. I think there's an important case to be made actually [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5937.72s)]
*  that maybe healthcare needs like a different kind of category to care for people that doesn't exist [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5943.24s)]
*  just in a clinic with a bed somewhere, but is a broader sort of understanding of people more [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5948.4400000000005s)]
*  broadly outside of just caring for them in their sickness, but also in their health or in this in [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5953.64s)]
*  between stage before they need to go to the hospital or get checked out by a clinician. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5957.64s)]
*  And maybe that sort of thing is coming. I hope it is. But if we can recover, and by the way, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5961.56s)]
*  it was the first hospital was of course a Christian hospital, right? Like this was invented in the [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5967.240000000001s)]
*  middle ages. Nurses we were talking about at breakfast, all the original nurses were [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5973.64s)]
*  Catholic women, religious, nuns. They taught Nightingale everything that she knew. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5982.360000000001s)]
*  There's still a really strong proliferation of religious hospitals, religious [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5988.52s)]
*  health organizations, health systems, many of which are Catholic one in seven beds in the United [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=5997.0s)]
*  States is actually at a Catholic facility. There are ways to recover this image of human dignity [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6001.56s)]
*  and replace the one that's in there now, especially again, if we have this broader religious revival [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6009.96s)]
*  under way that you're talking about. Can we recover this vision of human dignity [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6015.24s)]
*  that we've been articulating? I think the answer is yes, but we're going to need to, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6018.92s)]
*  and this is very much connected again to the show you did with the Means siblings about [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6022.2s)]
*  what is the God that is actually governing health care. Is it the God of mammon? Is it the God of [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6026.28s)]
*  consumerism? Is it the God of efficiency? Or is it something else, right? Is it a center of ultimate [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6031.4s)]
*  concern, God, that is nonviolent, that is about fundamental equality, that is about the most [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6038.92s)]
*  vulnerable, that is about not using individuals as mere means to another end for profit and [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6045.16s)]
*  efficiency and consumerism? There are enough people out there, there are enough people out there, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6049.72s)]
*  good people, to be a form of resistance to that. I'm biased, I'm a Catholic moral theologian, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6055.16s)]
*  I teach at a Catholic medical school. Again, I teach at a seminary as well, but I teach at [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6061.320000000001s)]
*  a seminary as well. I think one place to start would be institutions of the Catholic Church, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6067.16s)]
*  to say we are going to rebuild these institutions in ways that resist the kinds of things that [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6072.12s)]
*  happen when we put mammon and consumerism and efficiency at the center of what we do. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6080.68s)]
*  And we are well-primed to do something like that. Again, one in seven beds, it's a massive [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6086.6s)]
*  opportunity, and it doesn't need to be limited to Catholic institutions. There are plenty of [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6092.68s)]
*  non-Catholic institutions as well. But at least that's where I put my hope. That's where I say [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6095.88s)]
*  we can have a revival. Could you start a Christian hospital center and just say that we're not in the [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6101.0s)]
*  business of killing, we're in the business of healing? We're not going to do any killing here. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6107.24s)]
*  That's right. But could you do that? There's no hospital like that that I'm aware of. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6111.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, there's really no reason why you couldn't do it. In fact, this is what Catholic hospitals [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6115.96s)]
*  say. We have ethical and religious directives, which we say we aren't going to do these things. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6119.56s)]
*  There's no abortion in Catholic hospitals? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6125.4s)]
*  No hospital. There's no abortion. There's no euthanasia. Now, I'm not going to say that there [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6126.68s)]
*  aren't hospitals and systems that try to find their way around these things. They do. But it's [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6130.44s)]
*  at least in principle something that is forbidden. And it's not a no, it's a broader yes. It's a yes [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6134.52s)]
*  to a particular vision of human dignity that requires nos. But we have, for decades now, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6141.0s)]
*  in the United States had a really powerful attempt to carve out this space for ourselves [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6147.48s)]
*  through religious freedom. To say, yeah, I know you guys, you're for abortion. Yeah, I know you [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6155.5599999999995s)]
*  guys are doing this other thing. We're not going to do that in these hospitals. And by the way, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6160.12s)]
*  we can no longer call this a Catholic hospital if you're going to force us to do that. We will shut [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6164.36s)]
*  ourselves down, in fact, if you tell us we need to do this. And so far, we've had pretty good [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6167.5599999999995s)]
*  success, frankly, especially from the Supreme Court in telling us that yes, you're free as [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6172.44s)]
*  Catholic hospitals and other institutions to not do abortions, to not do physician-assisted suicide, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6179.16s)]
*  even contraception, even something like that. Catholic hospitals don't prescribe contraception, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6184.28s)]
*  at least in principle shouldn't. And so there's no reason, again, it needs to be limited to [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6188.919999999999s)]
*  Catholic hospitals. Again, it was the, oh, I didn't mention this, that you know who carved out the [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6194.679999999999s)]
*  religious freedom exemption for brain death in New Jersey? Orthodox Jews. So it was Orthodox [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6198.84s)]
*  Jews who said, yeah, our guys who have brain dead, not dead, and you're not going to force us [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6204.04s)]
*  to call them dead, and we're going to carve out religious freedom exemption for ourselves here [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6210.360000000001s)]
*  in New Jersey. So again, it doesn't need to be limited to even Christianity at all. Plenty of [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6213.56s)]
*  religious folks and even non-religious folks can imagine how this might work. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6219.32s)]
*  I agree completely. People who think there's an authority higher than themselves have the [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6224.36s)]
*  humility that is the foundation of wisdom and good decision-making. And people who think they're God [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6232.12s)]
*  always wind up going way off the rails, I think. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6237.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's right. And it's not an accident, right? Again, that historically, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6241.16s)]
*  it was Jews, it was Christians, and even Muslims to a certain extent who were very much connected [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6247.96s)]
*  in their early stages to both Christianity and Judaism who pushed back on abortion and [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6253.16s)]
*  fantasizing in the ancient world for the reasons that we've already talked about. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6257.5599999999995s)]
*  So is there anybody providing ethical guidance to the scientists funded by US tax dollars who [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6259.96s)]
*  are tampering with the building blocks of life and doing Frankenstein-like experiments, one of [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6268.04s)]
*  which resulted in COVID, in order not to save lives but to feel like God? Because there's an [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6273.16s)]
*  awful lot of that genetic engineering and the rest of it. Are there any ethical guidelines to that [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6279.96s)]
*  at all? There are medical ethicists who work in those spaces. Most of them, if I can just speak [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6287.24s)]
*  frankly, have been compromised with regard to the kinds of stuff we've been talking about so far. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6292.92s)]
*  So most of them would either be neutral or have no connection to the kinds of [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6298.12s)]
*  visions of human dignity and nonviolence. So they're not really ethicists then? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6303.88s)]
*  Well, they're certainly not ethicists that you and I would recognize as being good ethicists. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6308.2s)]
*  In fact, they might call them bad ethicists. Propagandists for murder. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6311.08s)]
*  That's what I would say. I mean, I don't know. I'm sure the Nazis had ethicists too. I mean, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6316.28s)]
*  it doesn't mean anything at a certain point. If you kill Dietrich Bonhoeffer, I'm sorry, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6319.88s)]
*  you don't have any working ethicists on staff. Yeah, the largest conference in bioethics in [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6324.36s)]
*  the United States is something called the ASBH, the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6331.8s)]
*  Conference. And I stopped going a few years ago because I realized that the only place that my [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6336.68s)]
*  voice was really welcome there was in the Christian Ethics Interest Group that met in the evenings. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6343.16s)]
*  The main papers, the main panels, not at all interested in hearing from someone like me. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6347.56s)]
*  Justifying evil was kind of their job? Like what are their guidelines exactly? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6353.32s)]
*  Well, it depends who you talk to, but a secularized context in bioethics has been sort of taken over [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6358.76s)]
*  by what's called principalism, which is this idea that there are four main principles in bioethics. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6365.4s)]
*  Turns out autonomy, really high on the list, the first principle actually. Non-eleficence, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6370.759999999999s)]
*  do no harm, which is a classic bioethics principle. Beneficence, do good and justice, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6375.48s)]
*  give everyone their due. But those principles, Tucker, are just so generic and so unspecific [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6379.719999999999s)]
*  that virtually anyone can manipulate those principles and sort of end up with what they [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6387.799999999999s)]
*  want at the end of the day. But don't kill people's non-elefics? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6391.32s)]
*  Well, you might say that's non-maleficence. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6394.28s)]
*  Well, clearly it's not. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6397.32s)]
*  But that's what I'm talking about. So what is harm is parasitic on what is good, right? And if we have [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6400.28s)]
*  a disagreement about what is good, then we're going to disagree about what non-maleficence is. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6406.5199999999995s)]
*  I have to say first, do no harm, right? Well, if I think that there's no such thing as human dignity [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6411.96s)]
*  and that we really just need to be maximizing organs for transplant, what is, do we know harm [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6417.24s)]
*  in any situation? We look quite different, right? It might in fact be saying, I don't really need to [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6421.48s)]
*  test for hypothalamic function. Let's just declare this individual dead and decide that we can take [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6425.799999999999s)]
*  their organs, right? So when we have these four sort of generic principles, which rule the day [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6431.24s)]
*  and by secular bioethics today, you can really get anywhere you want with them. And so it turns out, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6435.08s)]
*  frankly, that those of us who are doing theological bioethics end up in having our own conferences, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6440.599999999999s)]
*  our own journals, our own sort of intra insulated discussions. And secularized medicine really does [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6446.92s)]
*  is with few exceptions. There are some exceptions. Secularized medicine rarely gives us the kind of [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6455.8s)]
*  hearing. So there are no ethics without God. Like, why would there be actually? I mean, I think there's [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6461.16s)]
*  a strong case to be made that, that especially the, I mean, the first bioethicists were in fact [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6466.2s)]
*  theologians. We invented the field. Well, if there's no higher power, then how can there be [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6470.6s)]
*  absolute right or wrong? You can't say that you can say, I prefer this thing to that thing, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6476.28s)]
*  but you can't say that anything is wrong. Why is slavery wrong? Why is murdering your neighbor [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6482.04s)]
*  wrong? We can say, well, it's bad in some sense, but you can't say it's wrong. Can you? I think [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6487.96s)]
*  on what basis are you saying that? Yeah, I think, I think it's kind of, I like the cut flower analogy, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6495.0s)]
*  right? You can still say, well, here's a flower, right? And it's pretty and it's whatever, but it's [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6499.0s)]
*  been cut off from the thing that gives it life. It's dying. It's on its way out. So there are [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6505.08s)]
*  secular people who do, who do offer visions of human dignity. They offer visions of human equality, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6509.08s)]
*  but they've been so cut off from the tradition that God gave us. But they can't justify it. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6515.4s)]
*  Yeah. It's, if you, if you pin them down and you just go all the walk them all the way, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6519.8s)]
*  which is why I just think this is preferable. Like life is better than death. Cruelty is bad. Why's [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6522.6s)]
*  it bad? That's right. Cause I don't like it. Okay. But that, well, maybe I do like it. So how can you [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6527.08s)]
*  say you're right and I'm wrong? Because they're not appealing to anything above themselves. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6531.8s)]
*  They're forced to circular argument. And the thing that I find so frustrating about this is [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6536.12s)]
*  my secular counterparts in these fields sort of criticize religious people for being, you know, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6545.24s)]
*  believing in superstition, irrational, you know, and trying to impose their point of view on others. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6553.16s)]
*  But in reality, if you just walk these secular folks back to their first principles, their vision [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6560.44s)]
*  of the good, and you say, okay, we've walked you back and you believe in the greatest good for the [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6566.44s)]
*  greatest number. Why do you think that? Why do you think you should maximize the greatest good for [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6570.44s)]
*  the greatest number? And why do you think that's the primary thing you should do? And there aren't [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6574.04s)]
*  any rules governing that at all. They don't have an answer for that Tucker. It's just something that [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6577.48s)]
*  grabs them by some sort of authority or intuition or self-evidence. But that sounds a lot like a [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6581.639999999999s)]
*  faith claim. Right. They're just children. Have you ever asked them what do you think of the [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6587.72s)]
*  Nazi euthanasia program? Was that justifiable? And how is it different from what we have now? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6592.12s)]
*  Oh, they would say that the reason why the Nazi program was problematic is because it didn't [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6597.240000000001s)]
*  respect patient autonomy, the first principle of bioethics. And we just let we just- [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6602.2s)]
*  And we differ in what way? Well, given the conversation over the last hour and a half [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6607.96s)]
*  or whatever it's been, I think it's very clear we also do not respect patient autonomy. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6612.04s)]
*  Anyone who forces a vaccine on somebody by definition is not respecting patient autonomy. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6617.0s)]
*  If I'm telling you you're required by law to put some drug in your body that you don't want, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6623.24s)]
*  how am I treating you as a human being? I'm treating you as my slave, as a subhuman, right? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6629.32s)]
*  Well, that's the argument that we've heard now for several years, which is, isn't it interesting [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6634.04s)]
*  that many of you were all about bodily autonomy, are all about bodily autonomy, when it comes to [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6639.48s)]
*  reproductive rights, so-called, but then we're very happy to jettison conscience rights and bodily [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6646.52s)]
*  autonomy rights when it came to those sorts of issues. It doesn't seem to be, again, a kind of [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6653.4800000000005s)]
*  coherent vision of the good. What did the ethicist community say to that? Well, I'm sure they went [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6659.56s)]
*  all in on the vax mandates. I mean, of course they did. Yeah. I mean, as you know, there have been a [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6666.200000000001s)]
*  lot of important questions asked across the board recently that weren't asked at the time. But at [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6669.72s)]
*  that point, I think there was just a ton of fear, right? A sense that this is almost always how it [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6674.84s)]
*  works, right? These sort of things get eroded because of claims that are so fearful. But wait, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6680.12s)]
*  not to be mean or whatever, but that is my default. Don't we have ethicists precisely for the [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6684.6s)]
*  moments that are ruled by fear? Isn't that, that is what, when we lack a clear consensus on the [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6690.84s)]
*  right direction and when our judgment is muddled by panic, that's exactly the moment we need [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6697.24s)]
*  clear thinking ethicists, correct? Yes. Correct. That's why we employ them. That's right. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6705.88s)]
*  And it was at that moment that they were swept away by panic too? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6710.599999999999s)]
*  What? Not all of them, but a lot of them. A lot of them. I was one of the ones arguing that [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6715.24s)]
*  you know, Catholicism actually has a very robust sense of conscience, right? To say like, oh, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6721.96s)]
*  conscience is a place where you meet God in the most profound way and where God speaks to you in [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6727.64s)]
*  the most profound way. And conscience rights actually have been coded left for a lot of [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6735.64s)]
*  the church's history in recent years. But it's interesting, again, when this sort of fear took [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6743.64s)]
*  over, the focus on conscience sort of went away, right? Like this sense of, I mean, I don't agree [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6750.04s)]
*  with some of the claims that people were making about, you know, the kinds of connections to [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6757.0s)]
*  aborted body parts and things like that. Reasonable people can disagree about that. But I would say, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6762.04s)]
*  hey, this is enough of a serious argument. We ought to respect people's conscience rights [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6766.6s)]
*  to choose not to take the vaccine. That's exactly right. But it's so interesting that those [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6770.6s)]
*  arguments sort of evaporated in light of all that fear. Well, you didn't even hear them, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6774.92s)]
*  at least I didn't. Okay, so last question. I have no, I just, I'll just say it because I know that [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6779.08s)]
*  you're, well, you're a Catholic theologian and I'm a lifelong Protestant. So I've always been for [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6786.36s)]
*  contraception. I've never really thought about it. It was one of the things we used to make fun of [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6793.24s)]
*  the Catholics about. They were against birth control. Okay. They had these giant families, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6796.52s)]
*  which we for some reason considered bad. Like low rent, too many children. What are you Irish? Oh, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6800.04s)]
*  stop. It's like, I'm laughing because it's like, it's hard even to imagine having those [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6807.64s)]
*  attitudes now, but I once did. But anyway, I'm saying that by way of confession. But in the last [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6812.68s)]
*  few years, I have noticed the reason I've had cause to rethink all this is because I've noticed [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6818.52s)]
*  that almost every major push from the public health community and certainly from our politicians [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6823.0s)]
*  is anti-fertility. Yeah. That's what they're focused on. It's the one right you possess is the right [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6830.04s)]
*  to have an abortion. That's the only, you don't have the right to speak freely, to, you know, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6836.76s)]
*  to have control of your own money, to gather with like-minded people, to protest or petition your [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6841.0s)]
*  government. None of those rights still exist. The only right you have is the right to end your [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6846.76s)]
*  pregnancy. And of course, to prevent it in the first place through birth control. And I just, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6851.0s)]
*  I'm sensing a theme here. I'm not a genius, but I have noticed that the thread that connects all of [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6856.84s)]
*  their main concerns is the same and is they don't want you to have kids. And why is that? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6861.320000000001s)]
*  It's a multivariate problem. I mean, if you look at surveys, women are very consistently [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6867.16s)]
*  reporting that they would like to have more kids than the kids they actually have. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6876.04s)]
*  You think? Yeah. Yeah. And the reasons they give are very interesting. Both Vance and Waltz in the [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6879.96s)]
*  recent debate were asked about paid family leave as a possible option to pursue. And it was very [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6889.8s)]
*  interesting to hear them both offer sort of vaguely supportive ideas with regard to that. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6896.44s)]
*  A number of women give lack of paid family leave as reasons for why they don't have the number of [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6901.639999999999s)]
*  kids that they want to have. Others suggest that, you know, they would much rather have a, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6906.839999999999s)]
*  a, a, a not be in a two income trap, right? Where they feel like they must be away from their kids [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6912.36s)]
*  all the time and work. Elizabeth Warren, before she became a, just a totalitarian robot, which she is [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6919.879999999999s)]
*  today, wrote a wonderful book on this called The Two Income Trap, which I quoted at length on Fox [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6925.64s)]
*  News once without identifying the author. And it could hear people applauding in the audience [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6931.160000000001s)]
*  until he found it was Elizabeth Warren who wrote it, but she did write it. And she made that point. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6935.320000000001s)]
*  If you ask women what they actually want, not all, of course, but the overwhelming majority would [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6938.92s)]
*  like to raise their own children, particularly when they're little. Yeah. You know, no one wants to [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6944.52s)]
*  hang around a 15 year old. I got it. But when they're five, most women would like to raise [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6947.96s)]
*  their own kids and not import people from another country to do it. And that seems like the most [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6952.28s)]
*  human of all desires. And it's the one desire that we thwart. And I found that conversation about [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6956.28s)]
*  paid family leave, like nauseating actually, because that was, no one ever mentioned the [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6960.36s)]
*  possibility that maybe women could raise their own kids. That's right. Why do we have to choose [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6966.2s)]
*  between the two? Exactly. Well, how about the thing that people really want, like above all else, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6970.679999999999s)]
*  which is to be with their own children. The most important thing they'll ever do is have children. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6975.0s)]
*  Maybe they'd like to be with them for a couple of years. No one even mentioned that. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6979.64s)]
*  I think they don't, you know, I'm just pure speculation. I think one reason people don't [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6984.360000000001s)]
*  mention it is precisely because of how deeply the systems and structures which have led to the two [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6988.52s)]
*  income trap are foundational in our culture. We would have to undo so much of what our culture. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=6995.8s)]
*  Well, I hope we do it immediately because it's so rotten and anti-human. It's denying people [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7001.160000000001s)]
*  the true source of joy in their lives and substituting it with like a banking job [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7007.16s)]
*  or something that's utterly pointless and destructive. No, what you really need to [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7013.639999999999s)]
*  do instead of having kids is help us loan money and interest. I mean, that's so disgusting to me. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7017.32s)]
*  Sorry. And actually the exploit of lending money and interest used to be called usury and it used [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7023.96s)]
*  to be considered an intrinsically evil act in the tradition, by the way. Well, it still is in my [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7029.8s)]
*  house. So that's how I feel about it strongly. But that's considered wildly controversial. I mean, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7033.56s)]
*  like, you know, having six trans kids is considered great, but criticizing usury is considered like, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7040.120000000001s)]
*  whoa, off the charts, you're a bigot, you're crazy. Well, I find it disgusting. I just want to be on [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7046.6s)]
*  the record saying that. But anyway, but what, like, why would you want to deny people children? Like, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7054.04s)]
*  what is that impulse? Again, I think it's multivariant. The other variable I would include [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7061.08s)]
*  is the climate crisis that is constantly thrown at people, right? To say, like, I don't want to [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7065.88s)]
*  bring children into a world where everyone's going to die for things related to climate change. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7071.8s)]
*  I think also- They're not worried about nuclear war, which they've, I mean, they brought us to the [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7077.5599999999995s)]
*  brink of nuclear war. Where we are as of right now, October 2nd, I think it's October 2nd, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7081.08s)]
*  we're on the brink of nuclear war right now. But nobody cares. But they're worried about [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7085.8s)]
*  climate change. I mean, what is going on? It doesn't make any sense. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7090.28s)]
*  And again, there's no reason that we need to choose between the two. But I don't, at least [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7094.92s)]
*  I can't think of one. But then there's also the drug companies here as well. And this is, again, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7099.56s)]
*  I keep on bringing up this amazing show you did with the mean siblings that brought up [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7105.4800000000005s)]
*  Big Pharma and exploitive practices of contraception as part of Big Pharma. We talk about getting [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7110.76s)]
*  kids on a regimen, which makes Pharma shit tons of money for almost their whole lives. Well, how [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7118.280000000001s)]
*  about getting a young girl on birth control from the time she's 12 until the time she has menopause? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7123.96s)]
*  Think about that windfall. Think about what that means for the broader culture too. And we [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7133.88s)]
*  support patient autonomy, right? Except for 12-year-old girls where the doctor just says, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7142.280000000001s)]
*  okay, it's time for you to be on contraception now. And everyone sort of goes along, ho-hum. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7145.08s)]
*  And we're just now really starting to reckon with what this might be doing to women's bodies and [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7149.4s)]
*  beyond. Well, it's a disaster. And young women know that. And I think the number of young women [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7154.36s)]
*  getting off the pill is extraordinary. For the first time in my lifetime, I mean, it was always [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7159.16s)]
*  considered really subversive and not acceptable really to point out that the pill increased stroke [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7164.68s)]
*  risk, for example, just as abortion increases breast cancer risk. Not only to mention that [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7170.12s)]
*  either. Not allowed. But I never put it all together in my mind, which is the one thing that all of [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7174.5199999999995s)]
*  these attitudes have in common is the desire to stifle fertility. And it's hard to escape the [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7181.5599999999995s)]
*  conclusion that there's a spiritual force behind that. Yeah. And it's a spiritual force that may, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7189.719999999999s)]
*  again, run throughout the different topics we've engaged. It's, again, treating women not as [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7196.28s)]
*  fully autonomous individuals. Ironically, though, that's the language which is used to suggest that [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7203.96s)]
*  they need to do this, right? Except for women who do want to presend from this, who want to lead a [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7208.5199999999995s)]
*  different kind of lifestyle, who are often actually not religious at all, but sort of crunchy, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7213.5599999999995s)]
*  progressive lefties who say, I don't want to put this carcinogen in my body. I want to put this [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7217.639999999999s)]
*  poison in my body, right? That's, again, one of the things that's pushing back from this. We use [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7221.16s)]
*  the language, which actually inverts what is actually happening. We use the language of autonomy [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7227.719999999999s)]
*  and empowering women when in reality it's doing precisely the opposite. It's interesting, though, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7231.64s)]
*  the connection. I'm so glad you pointed that out. It's not just like evangelicals in Iowa [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7237.56s)]
*  who are suspicious of the current program. It's also like the furry armpit girls who are for that, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7243.240000000001s)]
*  who I support strongly. I should just say that. But what do those two have in common? No, but it's [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7250.68s)]
*  kind of secular granola people too, to the extent they still exist. There aren't many of those left. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7256.68s)]
*  I wish we had more. They're great people. But what do they have in common with religious people? Well, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7262.92s)]
*  they're both kind of grounded, actually, in something beyond the digital world. And they're [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7268.04s)]
*  both more in touch with themselves. Those are the two groups in America who might actually have a [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7274.120000000001s)]
*  moment of silence every day where they can listen. You know what I mean? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7278.52s)]
*  And skeptical of what's being foisted on them by corporations and others who want to make money. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7284.2s)]
*  It's only when you have that silence that you can be skeptical. Otherwise, your senses are hijacked [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7288.759999999999s)]
*  by the machine in your hand and you don't have time to think. And more important, you don't have [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7294.679999999999s)]
*  time to listen. You don't have time for silence. And it's in silence that you receive wisdom, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7299.719999999999s)]
*  obviously. And so the rest of the country goes to sleep with the TV on and only the [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7304.839999999999s)]
*  the granola chicks and the religious people don't have it on. And maybe they're hearing [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7312.92s)]
*  something that the rest of us should be hearing. And that's a wonderful thing to, I don't know if [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7317.96s)]
*  this is what we're going to finish on, but that's a wonderful thing. Can we make space for that [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7323.4s)]
*  silence, right? That place again, where God meets us in our most foundational way. I think that maybe, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7328.12s)]
*  I don't want to speak for you, maybe one reason you moved up here to Maine, because at least in [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7336.04s)]
*  my short time here, this seems like a wonderful place to encounter that silence, to put the phone [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7339.08s)]
*  away, to put the pounding feed that just helps you, not helps you, pushes you to doom scroll [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7343.8s)]
*  and feel terrible. But instead, think critically, but also think creatively. I can't tell you how [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7352.12s)]
*  many times my creative thoughts, even whole book ideas have come just when I was holding my infant [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7357.5599999999995s)]
*  son in my lap and just had nothing else to do but let that happen. But that's always where it comes. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7362.6s)]
*  I have a chair outside my, I take a sauna every day, not for health reasons. I'm obviously like [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7368.44s)]
*  one of the more unhealthy people you'll meet. I plan to buy a tin of chewing tobacco today. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7373.88s)]
*  So I'm not a health guy at all, but I am a silence person and that's why I do it. And it's known as [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7380.599999999999s)]
*  my Cedar church. And I was like, you know, if I get 15 minutes to sit buck naked in a hot room [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7385.639999999999s)]
*  in silence, like that's a massive improvement over not doing it. And I have a chair outside my sauna. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7390.759999999999s)]
*  I used to write my whole script just sitting there. You know, like you just, in silence, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7397.64s)]
*  only in silence can you receive, you know, actual clarity and wisdom. So I'm not articulating it. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7403.72s)]
*  You are. No, you got it. And that's historically, again, to take it back to the tradition that I'm [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7412.12s)]
*  bound by, there was so much emphasis on finding these times for silence, right? To imitate [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7419.240000000001s)]
*  Christ going into the wilderness, to hang out with the monks, to get out of the situation you're in [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7425.4s)]
*  and allow this voice to speak to you in a way that allows you to be both critical and creative. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7431.24s)]
*  It seems like a pretty scary religion you've signed up with Charlie. I can see why people hate it. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7435.639999999999s)]
*  It turns out. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7440.12s)]
*  Silence and nonviolence and- [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7444.12s)]
*  Imagination and critical thinking. Who wants that? [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7446.679999999999s)]
*  Carried, caring for disabled kids. Yeah, man. Whoa, slow down, man. You're freaking me out. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7450.28s)]
*  Sorry about that, Tucker. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7455.4s)]
*  I sure appreciate you're taking all this time to talk about all of this. Last question. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7457.0s)]
*  If people are interested in, and I interrupted you so many times, I'm afraid we didn't get [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7463.5599999999995s)]
*  to a lot of things, but for people who want to understand more about how you think and the way [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7469.08s)]
*  you've connected a lot of seemingly disconnected trends in our society, which are of a piece, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7475.4s)]
*  I think, where can they read you? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7480.92s)]
*  My Twitter handle is at CKMOSY, so at C-C-A-M-O-S-Y. Probably the book I've written, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7486.12s)]
*  I'm starting book 10, or I'm trying to finish book 10 by Thanksgiving, but probably the book that [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7493.24s)]
*  makes, I'm actually writing a book right now, trying to finish a book on how understanding [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7497.8s)]
*  what a good death looks like can resist physician assisted suicide. Maybe we could talk about that [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7502.52s)]
*  some other time too, but to answer the question you asked me, I wrote a book called Resisting [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7507.32s)]
*  Throwaway Culture, How a Consistent Life Ethic Can Unite a Fractured People, and that book really [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7512.5199999999995s)]
*  offers the kind of vision that I've been trying to articulate. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7518.28s)]
*  I hope you'll come back when your death book comes out. I actually have seen a good death. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7521.5599999999995s)]
*  I was really privileged to see that with someone I love, and boy, you know it when you see it, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7526.2s)]
*  don't you? Yes. But I haven't thought very deeply about it. You clearly have, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7531.719999999999s)]
*  so I hope you will come back. I will. Thank you. Thank you, Tucker. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7536.12s)]
*  The one thing that unites us all. It's going to happen. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7538.92s)]
*  Charlie, thank you very much. My pleasure. Thank you. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7542.2s)]
*  James O'Keefe's Line in the Sand premiering only on TCN on October 10th. You can sign up to watch [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7549.64s)]
*  at tuckercarlson.com. James O'Keefe's new documentary, Line in the Sand, at tuckercarlson.com. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7557.64s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. I know. Shocking that in an election year, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7572.12s)]
*  with everything at stake, Google would be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7579.72s)]
*  hearing anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear. But it turns out it's happening. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7585.08s)]
*  So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it, but that's a waste of time. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7590.12s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7593.8s)]
*  information that's true. It's not intentionally deceptive. And the way to do that on YouTube, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7598.92s)]
*  we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, and you will have a much higher [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVtq-7hVec&t=7604.6s)]
